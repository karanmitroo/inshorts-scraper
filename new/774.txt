Tata Motors board's independent Director Nusli Wadia in a letter to shareholders said that Nano, a car that was initially priced at ₹1 lakh, has proved to be a serious drain on the company's financial resources. "Even now, when it sells at ₹2.25 lakh, its sale is at a substantial loss to the company," Wadia added.
