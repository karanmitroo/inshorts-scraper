Electric carmaker Tesla has reportedly signed a deal with the Shanghai government to set up its own manufacturing facility in the city's free-trade zone in China. The agreement could enable Tesla to slash production costs, while incurring China's 25% import tariff. The electric carmaker intends to "clearly define" production plans in China by year's end, a Tesla spokesperson said.
