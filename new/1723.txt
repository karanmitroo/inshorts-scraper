Jaguar is returning to open-wheel racing for the first time since 2004 with a brand new team in the FIA Formula E Championship. The team will feature on the 2016 grid onwards. This move is expected to help the brand develop a whole new breed of electric performance racing and road cars from the lessons learnt in the Championship.
