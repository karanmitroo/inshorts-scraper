Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he believes drivers will be able to sleep in self-driving cars in two years. However, he added that "no system is ever going to be perfect." Musk reiterated that every time a human driver gets into a car, there is a chance that an accident may occur, and autonomous cars can reduce that probability.
