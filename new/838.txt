Italian luxury vehicle manufacturer Maserati has announced to launch its first all-electric car in 2020. It will be an electric version of its two-seater sports car Alfieri, which is scheduled to launch in 2019. Maserati's electric car would not rival Elon Musk-led Tesla's Model S, but instead will be a grand-touring coupe.
