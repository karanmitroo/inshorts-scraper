Sweden-based startup Uniti has raised nearly ₹9 crore ($1.3 million) through a crowdfunding campaign for its three-wheeled electric vehicle. The two-seater cars, which will cost about ₹14.8 lakh each, claim a top speed of 130 kmph and a range of 150 km on a single charge. The car aims to rival Renault and Nissan's electric vehicles.
