As a part of its biomaterials research, American automaker Ford is making car parts from shredded cash, leftover tomato parts and Coca-Cola bottles. Ford is also using plants like bamboo, wheat, rice hulls and coconut skins to make reliable car parts. Soybean-based foam developed by Ford is being used in every seat cushion of its cars.
