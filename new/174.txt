Nissan on Monday said it is recalling 1.2 million cars in Japan that did not meet domestic rules on final safety inspections. The announcement came after Nissanâ€™s shares slumped on reports that tests were performed by staff who were not certified to check the vehicles as per government standards. The affected vehicles were built between October 2014 and September 2017.
