Uber's 18-wheeler self-driving truck recently made its first ever delivery by transporting 50,000 cans of Budweiser beer across nearly 200 km in the US. The delivery was in partnership with brewing company AB InBev and each can read, "First delivery by self-driving truck". The Volvo truck was supplied by Otto, a self-driving vehicle group acquired by Uber in August.
