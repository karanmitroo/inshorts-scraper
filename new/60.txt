General Motors has revealed images of an autonomous car, 'The Cruise AV', without a steering wheel, pedals or manual controls. GM has petitioned US' Department of Transportation to start production of the vehicle from 2019. The car, which will be deployed as a ride-hailing vehicle, will be able to identify pedestrians, yield to emergency vehicles, and react to avoid collisions.
