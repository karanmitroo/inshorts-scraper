Porsche has agreed to pay some customers up to â‚¹11,200 in compensation after they claimed they had to buy sunglasses because of a design flaw in the cars. The owners said the windows and dashboards in 2007 to 2016 Porsches with Cognac, Luxor Beige or Sand Beige interiors gave off a "blinding" glare under sunlight, forcing them to purchase sunglasses.
