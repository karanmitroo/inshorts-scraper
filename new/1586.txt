German automaker Volkswagen on Friday suspended the sale of its 1.5L Vento diesel cars with manual transmission and recalled 3,877 units of the model in India over emission inconsistencies. Volkswagen clarified this is not connected to the global controversy over its use of "defeat" devices to cheat emission tests. The company added that none of its other cars were affected.
