Reacting to GST cess hike on mid-sized, large cars and SUVs by up to 7%, Mercedes-Benz India CEO Roland Folger said the decision to increase the cess is very unfortunate. He said the cess hike overlooks the contribution they make to the industry and to the economy. Notably, Audi India head Rahil Ansari also said it is "disappointing".
