Mahindra Group's Executive Chairman Anand Mahindra on Tuesday tweeted a video of South Korean drivers' response to a tunnel accident with the caption, "It's the kind of culture we need...everywhere, in all things." The 45-second video shows drivers parking their cars to the tunnel's sides in an orderly manner to make way for police and medical help.
