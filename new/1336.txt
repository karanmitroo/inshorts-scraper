Israel-based technology firm Mobileye ended its collaboration with electric-vehicle maker Tesla on Tuesday. Though Mobileye will provide technical support for its EyeQ3 processor, it won't develop Autopilot-related products for Tesla. Mobileye said that its earnings won't be affected as it will direct resources towards its partnership with BMW and Intel for developing self-driving features.
