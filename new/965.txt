Silicon Valley startup Atieva's first electric car, to be unveiled in December 2016, reportedly resembles rival Tesla's Model S sedan. The car, which will be called 'Atvus', will be a four-door sedan, like a Model S. Earlier in September, the company's deputy general manager had revealed that the car will accelerate from 0-100 kmph in under three seconds.
