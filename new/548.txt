American electric carmaker Tesla, led by billionaire Elon Musk, on Friday said it has raised $1.2 billion by selling common shares and convertible debt. This amount is roughly 20% more than what Tesla had announced it was looking to raise. The capital will fund the production of Tesla's upcoming Model 3 car, which will reportedly also be available in India.
