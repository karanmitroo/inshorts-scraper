Electric vehicle maker Tesla's rival Atieva has changed its name to Lucid Motors. The Silicon Valley-based startup will unveil a concept of its electric sedan by the end of this year and begin the sales by 2018. It will be powered by an 87 kWh battery that generates 900 horsepower and provides acceleration from 0-100 kmph in under 3 seconds.
