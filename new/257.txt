Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the automaker's Model S 100D has become world's first production electric car to travel for over 1,000 km on a single charge. The run took 29 hours to complete and the driver kept the car at 40 kmph while riding on low-rolling resistance tyres. Air conditioning was also turned off during the drive.
