American multinational Ford Motor Company ended 91 years of car manufacturing in Australia on Friday, having opened its first Australian production line in 1925. Ford, General Motors, and Toyota had announced in 2013 that they were quitting Australia and shedding 6,600 jobs because of high production costs, distance from potential export markets and increasing competition.
