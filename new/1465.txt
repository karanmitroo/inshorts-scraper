Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover is reportedly suing Chinese automaker Jiangling Motor for allegedly copying its Range Rover Evoque SUV. The suit claims that Jiangling's first China-made model that went on sale last year, the Landwind X7 SUV, has copied the design of the Evoque. The Jiangling's X7 costs around a third of the price of an Evoque.
