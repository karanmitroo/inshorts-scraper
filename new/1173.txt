Australian motoring organisation RAC has launched the country's first ever driverless bus called RAC Intellibus, the trials of which began on Wednesday. The 11-seater bus will run on a 2.5 km route at a speed of 20 kmph. It has reportedly achieved the highest level of automation as it has no steering wheel, no operator or even pedals.
