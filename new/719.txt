Japanese automaker Toyota has unveiled a new concept of self-driving car called 'Concept-i', that notifies the cars driving behind it about upcoming road hazards or turns through an exterior LED lighting system. It also greets both the driver and the passengers approaching towards it. The car's integrated with a virtual companion 'Yui' that learns the driver's behaviour and driving pattern.
