Uber has admitted that it found one of the documents Google spinoff Waymo alleges was stolen by a former employee, on his computer. However, Uber emphasised that the document was not found on Uber's computers, but on the employee's personal device. Waymo claims that the employee downloaded several confidential documents in June 2016, one month before resigning and joining Uber.
