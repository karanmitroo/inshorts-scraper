Joshua Neally, a 37-year-old owner of Tesla Model X has claimed that the car's Autopilot mode saved his life and drove him to hospital in July. Neally, who suffered blockage in lung arteries while driving, was driven for over 32 km by the car's Autopilot. However, Neally had to drive the final bit to the hospital on his own.
