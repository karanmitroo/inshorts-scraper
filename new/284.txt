Porsche is set to end its participation in the oldest active sports car race, the Le Mans World Endurance Championship (WEC), as it is joining the Formula E, the all-electric racing series, in 2019. Porsche has become the second manufacturer to leave Le Mans in favour of focusing on Formula E, after Audi did the same in October 2016.
