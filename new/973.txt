American carmaker Ford delayed the launch of its latest F-Series Super Duty truck, over unspecified "parts issues", according to a union official at Ford's Kentucky factory. It is "impossible to build all of the lost units in the third-quarter", and can negatively affect Ford's third quarter earnings, the official added. The 2017 Super Duty is priced starting at $32,500.
