A Mercedes dealer in New Jersey, USA refused to sell a new Mercedes GLS550 to a US-based Indian buyer, who wished to exchange his old Mercedes, fearing he would "sell it to Taliban." He paid $1,000 deposit and updated his insurance, after which he was told he comes from a "high risk" area in US which sells cars to Taliban.
