Aircraft manufacturer Moller has put its original Skycar 400 'flying car' on sale on the condition that it cannot be flown. The car is believed to be world's first vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, first demonstrated in 2001. It claims to have a speed of 500 kmph when cruising at 20,000 feet, but hasn't been legally approved for flight.
