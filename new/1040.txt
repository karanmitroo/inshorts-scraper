Japanese automaker Toyota announced on Thursday that it will not offer a diesel variant of its new C-HR compact model following Volkswagen's emissions scandal. The company's Executive Vice President said that demand for diesel engines has fallen sharply over the past 6-12 months. He added that Toyota is likely to drop diesel variants from future renewals of its models also.
