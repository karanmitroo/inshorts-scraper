Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen (VW) on Monday said that its production at six plants was impacted and over 25,000 workers were affected following a dispute between the carmaker and two of its suppliers. Volkswagen said it will resume talks to negotiate a settlement with Germany-based suppliers CarTrim and ES Automobilguss, who are seeking compensation after the carmaker canceled a contract.
