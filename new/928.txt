Chinese technology firm LeEco, which unveiled its autonomous electric vehicle LeSee Pro in US on Wednesday, was unable to display the car on stage. The car was delayed on its way from London where it was being used by Transformers director Michael Bay for the latest instalment of the movie. The car was made available for viewing after the event.
