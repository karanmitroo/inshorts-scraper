British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has developed a new technology to prevent the doors of a car from crashing into nearby objects when opened. The system uses existing car sensors to detect approaching cyclists or to measure how far a door can be opened to prevent denting. The system can also help while parking the car in tight spaces.
