A Canadian inventor William Liddiard has created a prototype of wheels that allow a car to move in all directions. Liddiard fitted the omnidirectionalâ€‹ wheels on a Toyota Echo enabling it to glide sideways and spin 360 degrees. Designed to be used in all weather and road conditions, the wheels can be bolted on any car.
