Following Supreme Court's ban on vehicles with BS-III emission norms, auto firms are stuck with a stock of over 8 lakh such vehicles valued at up to â‚¹20,000 crore. Around 6.7 lakh two-wheelers, 97,000 commercial vehicles, and 40,000 three wheelers have been affected by the ban. Notably, the SC asserted the health of millions was more important than commercial interests.
