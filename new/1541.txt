Japanese car manufacturer Toyota will unveil Toyota Setsuna, a concept car crafted almost entirely out of wood, at the upcoming Milan Design Week. The two-seater car made of cedar and birch wood was built using traditional Japanese carpentry techniques that don't involve nails or screws. It has a 100-year meter embedded inside which can track how old the car is.
