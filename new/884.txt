Automaker Hyundai has partnered with Seoul-based startup VTouch to commercially produce gesture-based heads-up displays (HUDs) by the end of 2017. The display above the dashboard will let drivers browse through music, make calls or set navigation just by making gestures with their fingers towards the windscreen. BMW recently unveiled a similar concept called 'AirTouch' for its 7 Series.
