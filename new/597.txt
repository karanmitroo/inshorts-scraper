A female engineer at American carmaker Tesla has accused the Elon Musk-led company of ignoring her complaints of "pervasive harassment" and paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work. The engineer's discrimination lawsuit, filed last year, also claims harassment from men on the factory floor "including... inappropriate language, whistling, and cat calls."
