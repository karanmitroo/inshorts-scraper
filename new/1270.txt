Car manufacturer Ferrari's iconic logo featuring a black prancing horse was presented to its founder, Enzo Ferrari, by the mother of an Italian World War One pilot who had painted the emblem on his plane. Enzo Ferrari, who died 28 years ago on August 14, 1988, added a yellow background to the logo to represent his native city of Modena.
