Automotive news platform Autoblog has launched a new video series called 'CarBoom' that shows different ways in which cars can be destroyed. "Each week we'll be exploding, smashing, flinging, and straight-up eradicating anything on four wheels in the craziest ways we can think of", said Autoblog. The first episode features two cars being destroyed by confetti poppers and a fireball.
