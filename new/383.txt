Google's self-driving car spinoff company Waymo has started testing autonomous truck technology. This comes nearly a year after Uber acquired trucking startup Otto to begin its own self-driving truck venture. Notably, Otto Co-founder Anthony Levandowski was a former Google employee who has been accused of stealing 14,000 confidential documents on self-driving car technology from Waymo.
