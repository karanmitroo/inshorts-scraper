In a recently published patent application, taxi-hailing startup Uber has used graphics of dinosaurs to represent self-driving cars. The patent describes how users will be able to issue commands to the self-driving taxis from their smartphones. Operations that the users will be able to control include unlocking the car's doors, toggling its lights, and operating its audio system.
