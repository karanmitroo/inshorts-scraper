Google's self-driving car project's technology head Dmitri Dolgov in a recent interview said, "Driving is a social activity...weâ€™re building a driver". Dolgov added that a self-driving car should not only be able to detect and recognise humans and other objects, it should also be able to understand their behaviour. He said that Google cars can detect and understand hand signals.
