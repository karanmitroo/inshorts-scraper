America's United Automobile Workers union has rejected a charge by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that a factory worker who publicly criticised the company was paid by the organisation. "We hope Tesla would apologise to their employee for spreading fake news about him," said the union organisation. The worker had complained of injuries, unfair promotions and low pay at Tesla.
