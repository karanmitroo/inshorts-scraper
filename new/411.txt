Zach Lovering, the project leader at aircraft manufacturer Airbus' self-driving car project, has said that a ride in the company's under-development flying taxis will cost about â‚¹100 per km. The electric aircraft, called 'Project Vahana', will fly autonomously using eight rotors. The final version of the car will reportedly be launched in 2020 with a range of 100 kilometres.
