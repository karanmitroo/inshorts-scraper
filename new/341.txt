In Google's lawsuit against Uber for stealing self-driving car technology, Google has said ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick knew in March 2016 that former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski who joined Uber had five discs of confidential Google data. Kalanick reportedly told Levandowski that Uber didn't want the information, following which Levandowski told Kalanick he had destroyed the discs.
