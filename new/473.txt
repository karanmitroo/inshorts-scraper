Automaker General Motors' Venezuelan arm has fired almost 2,700 plant workers through a text message informing them that they are no longer employed by the company. The workers said they received severance pay in their bank accounts and their corporate email accounts had been deactivated. This comes after a court ordered the seizure of the company's plant in Venezuela.
