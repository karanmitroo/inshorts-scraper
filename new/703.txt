According to a report released by the US government, electric carmaker Tesla knew that drivers would misuse its semi-autonomous Autopilot mode and tested all possible scenarios. "Tesla considered that drivers might fail to pay attention, fall asleep, or become incapacitated," said the report. Tesla has been cleared of any fault in a fatal accident involving its Autopilot system last year.
