Former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn on Thursday declined to tell German lawmakers when he first learned about the automaker's emissions scandal. On being asked whether he had known about software cheating earlier, he said, "That is not the case." Earlier, Volkswagen agreed to pay the largest ever US criminal fine levied on an automaker for cheating diesel emission tests.
