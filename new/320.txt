Chinese internet giant Baidu's billionaire CEO Robin Li is being investigated by police after he demonstrated the company's self-driving car in Beijing. While riding in the car's passenger seat, Li placed a video call and said the car was on autopilot. Self-driving cars are banned from public roads in China and Baidu's car will likely be confiscated, said a lawyer.
