Nissan has said its autonomous cars will use the Seamless Autonomous Mobility technology built by NASA for the Mars Rover. On facing an uncertain situation, the vehicle will park itself in a safe spot and request help from a command centre. A human assistant will assess the situation and "paint" a virtual lane for the car to drive itself through.
