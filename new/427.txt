Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick had called his Tesla counterpart Elon Musk last year to propose a partnership on self-driving cars, according to an upcoming book by Fortune magazine's reporter. "Elon told me I should stick to what we do best or I’m going to f*ck it all up," Kalanick said. "That’s when I knew Tesla was competing," he added.
