The worldâ€™s biggest long-haul airline Emirates said it is unhappy with the performance shortfalls affecting $6.1 billion worth of Rolls-Royce engines it ordered. "We have a new engine coming on and there are some issues with that...We want the engines as promised in the contract," President Tim Clark said. The engines would power a batch of 50 Airbus A380 jets.
