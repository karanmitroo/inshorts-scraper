Electric vehicle maker Tesla's rival Lucid Motors on Thursday unveiled its first car called the 'Air' which travels over 640 kilometres on a single charge. Powered by a 100 kWh battery, the luxury sedan accelerates from 0-100 kmph in just 2.5 seconds. Founded by former Tesla and BMW executives, Lucid Motors plans to launch the Air in 2018.
