A new human-powered land speed record was recently set by cyclist Todd Reichert by riding a bicycle inside an egg-shaped shell at a top speed of 141 kmph in Nevada. Made by company AeroVelo, which makes human-powered vehicles, the bicycle was faster than most of the Indian trains, including Shatabdi Express. The bike had a lightweight frame and thin tyres.
