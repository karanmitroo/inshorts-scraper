Spencer Dale, Chief Economist of oil company BP, formerly British Petroleum, has said that growth of electric cars will not be a "game changer" for oil industry. "It's not Teslas and the US. It's the fact that 2 billion people, mainly in Asia, are moving to middle income and can buy their first car, that drives oil demand," he said.
