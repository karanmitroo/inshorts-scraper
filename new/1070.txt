Swedish automobile maker Scania recently generated a 750,000 sq ft working clock in a deserted airfield by strategically deploying 14 trucks that kept moving round-the-clock. Scania employed 90 drivers for two hours each, to drive the trucks representing the second, the minute and the hour hands of the clock. Fleet managers kept guiding the trucks from a monitoring room.
