German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Chief of Staff Peter Altmaier on Saturday said German carmakers must invest more in electric vehicles and take on Elon Musk's Tesla. "When is our automobile industry, which is so good, actually going to be in a position to build a car that travels 50 kilometres further than a Tesla and costs â‚¬10,000 less?" Altmaier said.
