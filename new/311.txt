Victoria Beckham has been slammed by Land Rover's design director Gerry McGovern for 'exaggerating' her role in designing one of the company's newest launches, a special edition VB Evoque. "She didn't design the car... [T]o be a car designer takes years," he said. In an interview, Victoria had reportedly claimed that she had a 'hands-on' role in the design.
