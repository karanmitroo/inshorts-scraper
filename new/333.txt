Swedish startup Einride has unveiled a prototype of a self-driving truck called 'T-pod' that has no steering wheel, pedals, or windshield, along with no space for a human driver. The 23-foot-long electric truck can be controlled remotely by a human or it can operate autonomously without humans. The truck can travel 200 km on a single charge.
