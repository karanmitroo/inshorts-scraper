South Korea is planning to develop a high-speed train system in the next three years, aimed to travel at speeds of up to 1,000 kmph. Based on a hyper-tube technology, that propels floating pod-like vehicles through tubes under partial vacuum, the train will travel from Seoul to Busan in half an hour, instead of the current time of three hours.
