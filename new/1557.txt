Seattle-based startup Pure Watercraft has created an eco-friendly electric vehicle motor for boats to replace gas-powered motors. It can push a lightweight 27-foot boat at about 34 kmph and can run up to 40 hours on a single charge, the Co-founder said. It also comes with a cooling system that uses the water around it to keep the electronics cool.
