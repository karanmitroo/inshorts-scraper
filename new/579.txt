A video of Elon Musk-led Tesla's yet to be launched Model 3's prototype has been shared by Unplugged Performance, a car modifying shop located near Tesla's Design Studio in the US. It shows the prototype driving along SpaceX's Hyperloop test track. Claimed to be its most affordable car to date, Tesla will begin producing Model 3 from July 2017.
