A world record-holding Chinese driver named Yue Han, recently completed the Nordschleife lap in Germany's NÃ¼rburgring racing complex entirely on the left two wheels of a Mini Cooper. The feat involved negotiating 73 corners and a 300-metre difference in elevation over a 20.8-km track. Han finished the task in a record 46 minutes, averaging a speed of around 27 kmph.
