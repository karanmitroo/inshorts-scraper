Aston Martin has built a limited edition V12 Vantage S Spitfire 80 model celebrating the 80th anniversary of British warplane Supermarine Spitfire. The warplane was employed by the Royal Air Force and its allies during and after the Second World War. The car comes with a Duxford Green paint-job and splashes of yellow to mimic the look of the warplane.
