Electric car maker Tesla CEO Elon Musk in an email has directed employees to follow the company's no negotiation and no discount policy on new cars, after a Twitter user raised concerns. Musk responded on Twitter saying, "Am tracking this down...There are zero discounts even for family." Musk also apologised to his employees for the "draconian language" in the email.
