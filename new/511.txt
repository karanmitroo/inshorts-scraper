Taxi-hailing startup Uber revealed that before Google's self-driving car spinoff Waymo sued it for theft of trade secrets, Waymo had already taken legal action against its former employee Anthony Levandowski. Uber said that given the provisions in Waymo's arbitration agreement with Uber's current employee Levandowski, the ongoing lawsuit should also be settled through mediation and not in a court.
