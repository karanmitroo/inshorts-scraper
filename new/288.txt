High-speed transportation startup Hyperloop One has conducted the first full-scale test of its system, achieving full vacuum conditions in a closed tube environment. The 28-foot-long pod made by Hyperloop One uses electromagnetic propulsion and magnetic levitation to travel in the tubes. The final system is expected to reach 1,200 kmph, while the test pod could only achieve 112.6 kmph.
