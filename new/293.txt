American entrepreneur George Hotz's startup Comma.ai has launched a â‚¹5,700 device called 'Panda' that can track a car's driving data like acceleration, gas tank details, and how hard the brake was hit at a certain time. The Wi-Fi enabled device, which also acts as car's dashcam, shows the recorded data and footage when paired with a dedicated app called 'Chffr'.
