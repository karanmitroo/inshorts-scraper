Automaker Hyundai Motor's South Korean labour union on Monday staged its first full nationwide strike in 12 years. This followed a series of partial stoppages since July at Hyundai's South Korean factories, its biggest manufacturing base. Notably, these have resulted in lost production of 1,01,400 vehicles worth $2.02 billion (as of Friday), Hyundai's biggest output loss in vehicles' value terms.
