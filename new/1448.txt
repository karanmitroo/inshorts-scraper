British luxury car manufacturer Aston Martin's Design Chief Marek Reichman has said that the company will build only 99 units of its AM-RB 001 model or the Project Nebula hypercar. Expected to launch in 2018, the hypercar combines the latest aerodynamics from Formula 1 and the design of an Aston Martin sports car. It will reportedly be a petrol-electric hybrid.
