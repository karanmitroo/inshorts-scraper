A father-son duo in Russia have remade a VAZ-2110 Lada car into a robot inspired by the Transformers movies. The pair reportedly worked on the project for six months and also added fully-functioning guns to the car. "We plan to build another two cars, based on the same concept. We already have a lot of quirky ideas," said the father.
