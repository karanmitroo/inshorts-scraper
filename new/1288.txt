Workers at the Wisconsin-based customisation shop Vintage Works have made the 'Speeder Bike' featured in the sci-fi franchise Star Wars. The bike does not only look like the one featured in the movie, but also sounds the same. Its handlebars are customised to steer the motorcycle as well as control the flaps at the front.
