Ferrari on Tuesday unveiled a special open-top edition of its limited production hybrid sports car series 'LaFerrari'. All available units of the convertible were sold-out at a private event earlier this year, with an estimated price of $1.4 million per unit. Sporting the same performance as the original LaFerrari, the new model offers removable carbon fibre hard and soft tops.
