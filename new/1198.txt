The logo of Toyota consists of three ovals and has every letter of its name. The outer oval symbolises the world embracing Toyota, while the inner ovals symbolise the hearts of the customer and the company, which was founded 79 years ago on August 28, 1937. Interestingly, each oval is drawn with different stroke thicknesses, to highlight Japanese calligraphy art.
