Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj on Thursday said stifling innovation will turn 'Made in India' into 'Mad in India'. "If your innovation...depends on government approval...it will not be a case of 'Made in India', but 'Mad in India'," Bajaj said, adding that India is the only country that has not given the company permission to sell its four-wheeler.
