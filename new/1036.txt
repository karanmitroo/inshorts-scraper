German police on Thursday said that a Tesla car operating under Autopilot mode had driven into the back of a bus while changing lanes. The police said they plan to investigate "why (Autopilot) did not work". However, the electric car maker said in a statement that the collision was unavoidable because the bus swerved into the vehicle's lane.
