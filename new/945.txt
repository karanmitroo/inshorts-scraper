Toyota's hydrogen fuel cell buses set to launch in 2017, will deliver 235 kWh of power, which is three times the power produced by Tesla's all-electric Model S sedan. The bus will consist of 10 high-pressure tanks holding 600 litres of compressed hydrogen. It can be used as a generator or power source in the event of disasters.
