Sportswear manufacturer Adidas has filed a legal challenge against carmaker Tesla's old logo for its upcoming Model 3 cars. Adidas claims that the three horizontal bars used by Tesla resemble its 3-Stripes trademark and will "cause confusion" between the brands. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed the company will use the numeric '3' instead of stripes as the logo.
