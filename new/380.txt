The National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) has unveiled the concept of an app-controlled self-driving modular car called 'InMotion'. The electric pod-like concept of car does not have any dashboard controls and occupants adjust the seating arrangements, lighting and environmental settings with a paired app. The windows of the concept car are intended to operate as displays to maximize workspace.
