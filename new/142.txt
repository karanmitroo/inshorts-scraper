American electric carmaker Tesla has recalled its 11,000 Model X cars with second-row fold-flat seats built between October 28, 2016 and August 16, 2017 over safety issues. Tesla found the seat on the left side of the second row seats could move forward during a crash. Tesla further said, it hasn't received reports of any accidents relating to the issue.
