Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted a pun about 'low' expectations from his newly-launched tunnelling startup, 'The Boring Company'. The startup aims to create an underground tunnel network to let cars bypass traffic by transporting them at 200 kmph on electric sleds. Musk's original idea for the startup was considered a joke, as he tweeted about it while stuck in traffic.
