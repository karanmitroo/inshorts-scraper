Following Yamaha Japanâ€™s recall of the R25, MT25, R3 and MT320, Yamaha India also announced a recall of 902 units of YZF-R3 on Thursday. The affected motorcycles suffer from clutch pressure plate and oil pump assembly malfunction, which may render the motorcycle non-operational. The defective parts will be replaced with the new ones free of cost at authorised Yamaha dealerships.
