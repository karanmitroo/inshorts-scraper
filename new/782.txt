One of Uber's self-driving taxis was caught running a red light on Wednesday, the same day the service was launched in San Francisco. However, the ride-hailing service has blamed the incident on the human driver who sat behind the wheel of the autonomous car to take control if required. Uber added that it has suspended the driver involved.
