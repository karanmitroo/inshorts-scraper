Singapore has launched a new pilot program where large buses will be turned into self-driving buses with high-tech sensors. Once ready, the buses will travel roughly 1.4 kilometre between a university and a nearby industrial park for field trials. A month ago, self-driving car technology startup nuTonomy started testing its cars in Singapore.
