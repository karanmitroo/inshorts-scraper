British luxury automaker Rolls-Royce has created a customised unit of its Ghost car named 'Elegance' with 1,000 crushed diamonds in the paint. The paint, which was applied only to the top section of the car, took two months to create and is the most expensive paint on a Rolls-Royce car. The car has leather seats and lambswool footmats inside.
