BMW has unveiled a concept for the 'Motorrad Concept Link' bike which can automatically read the rider's schedule for the day and plan the shortest routes accordingly. The electric bike can also pick "suitable music" for the trip and comes with a connected jacket, wearing which the rider can open the luggage compartment with a wave of the hand.
