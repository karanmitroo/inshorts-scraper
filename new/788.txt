Mercedes-Benz has launched a peer-to-peer car-sharing service called 'Croove' in Munich that lets owners of any car put their vehicle on rent. The Croove app instructs owners on how to price rent, and lets renters find a car that suits their needs. For the duration of the rental, the cars will be insured for up to â‚¹7 crore.
