F1 team Red Bull Racing has released a documentary showing how the pit stops have changed from over-a-minute to less than three-second-long stops. The video titled 'The History of the Pit Stop - Gone in Two Seconds' also revealed how McLaren F1 designer Gordon Murray and his team used pressurised beer kegs in the 1980s to fuel a car.
