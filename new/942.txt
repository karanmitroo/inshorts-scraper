The new self-driving car hardware being fitted into new Tesla cars will cost customers $8,000 (₹5,35,000) more on the company's S and X models, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said. However, he added that the software required to enable fully autonomous operation is still being tested. The cost for the upcoming Model 3 starts at $35,000 (₹23,41,000) without new hardware.
