Ford Motor Company Founder Henry Ford, who was born on July 30, 1863, was encouraged by light bulb inventor Thomas Edison to build a car while working at Edison's company. In 1896, Edison reviewed his plans for a horseless carriage and advised Ford to keep working on it. He subsequently created a second prototype, and founded Ford Motors later.
