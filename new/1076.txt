German automaker Volkswagen has won the 26th Ig Nobel spoof award in Chemistry for engineering its vehicles to produce fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested. The company equipped a 'defeat device' in its vehicles that controlled emissions of an engine while undergoing government tests. Volkswagen is spending up to $16.5 billion to address US environmental and owner claims.
