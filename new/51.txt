South Korean carmaker Hyundai has recalled nearly 88,000 old cars in the US after identifying an electrical short in the antilock brake system (ABS) that could cause engine-compartment fires. It also said there are chances of the module overheating and causing a fire even when the cars are turned off. The recall affects certain 2006 manufactured Sonatas and 2006-2011 Azeras.
