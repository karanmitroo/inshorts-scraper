A driver in the UK crashed his Ferrari 430 Scuderia supercar, priced at about â‚¹2 crore, in an accident after owning it for one hour. The driver reportedly suffered just cuts and bruises after the Ferrari "went airborne and burst into flames". Police believe the crash was caused due to "wet conditions" and not the car's speed.
