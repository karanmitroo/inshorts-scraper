Swedish carmaker Volvo has said its self-driving car software gets 'confused' by kangaroos in Australia. "We've noticed with the kangaroo being in mid-flight when it's in the air, it actually looks like it's further away, then it lands and it looks closer," said Volvo. Australia's National Roads and Motorists' Association said over 16,000 vehicle collisions with kangaroos occur every year.
