Tesla Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk on Friday said that the Tesla app will let owners allow others to drive their cars when they aren't using it. Owners will be able to add or subtract users from the 'shared fleet'. Announced last week, 'shared fleet' enables Tesla owners to make money for them when they arenâ€™t using it.
