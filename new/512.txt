A 44-year-old black factory worker at Tesla's California-based plant has sued the Elon Musk-led company over alleged racial discrimination and sexual harassment. Filed by California Civil Rights Law Group on his behalf, the lawsuit claims, "They would call him the N-word throughout his workday, talk about the size of his penis and even placed a drill gun into his buttocks."
