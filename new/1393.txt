Jaguar Land Rover has developed a 'Surface ID Research Technology' for self-driving vehicles that uses advanced sensors to identify and predict the surface conditions on the road ahead. Once identified, the technology prompts the driver to change the terrain response mode. This helps the drivers to optimise all-terrain performance of the vehicle without loss of momentum or control.
