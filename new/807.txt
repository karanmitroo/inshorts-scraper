Japanese automaker Honda has claimed that its new electric vehicle concept called 'NeuV' will have an 'emotion engine' that will allow the car to react to its owner's conversations and emotions. The engine integrates artificial intelligence to help the owner make a bond with the vehicle. The concept will be showcased by Honda at consumer technology show CES next year.
