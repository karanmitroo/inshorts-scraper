Electric carmaker and Tesla rival Faraday Future has been sued for ₹12.2 crore by visual effects studio The Mill Group over unpaid dues. The studio, which made a graphical presentation of the startup's first car FF 91, alleges it received only ₹13 lakh from Faraday against the agreed ₹12.42 crore. Faraday's payment to the company was due in October 2016.
