Volkswagen-owned Audi is recalling more than 52,000 luxury cars in the US and Canada to fix faulty fuel lines. The recall covers certain A6 and A7 cars from the 2012 through 2014 model years. Volkswagen said that fuel lines have a compression point to make them easier to install, but over time that point can weaken and may leak fuel.
