Nissan has introduced a new driver-assist technology called ProPilot, which will be available in its new Serena minivan in Japan. It makes the minivan capable of accelerating, braking and navigating highway stop-and-go traffic in a single lane. The system sends warnings when drivers take their hands off the wheel and eventually disables the autopilot mode if the prompts are ignored.
