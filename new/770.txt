Uber has responded to California regulators' order to stop its self-driving taxi service in San Francisco by asking why it is required to get a permit while Tesla's autopilot technology does not need one. The multi-billion dollar startup has argued that its self-driving cars don't need the permit since there is always a human driver behind the wheel.
