South Korean automaker Hyundai's sixth-generation Elantra sedan will officially go on sale in India on August 23. The third all-new Elantra model for India is both wider and longer compared to the outgoing model. The new model is expected to carry forward the existing 1.6-litre diesel engine, that currently delivers 128PS of power.
