Self-driving technology startup Otto, which demonstrated a driverless truck in Nevada and got acquired by Uber, did not have a license for autonomous testing and knowingly broke the traffic rules, according to an investigative study. However, Otto didn't face any consequences as the current rules don't punish violations. Amendments to the current regulations could introduce penalties only by 2017.
