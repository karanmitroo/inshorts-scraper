Most luxury automakers like Bentley and Lamborghini have stable base pricing around the world, but governmental tariffs vary greatly. For example, the Rolls-Royce Ghost is priced at over â‚¹4 crore in Mumbai, which is an increase of more than 200% over its UK price. Similarly, the price of a Cadillac CT6 is roughly 85% more in Tokyo than in Canada.
