All Volvo car models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrid, the Swedish company said on Wednesday. Volvo is now among the first major traditional automakers to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by an internal combustion engine. The carmaker has also announced a project to launch self-driving cars by 2021.
