Commenting on Nano's future, Tata Motors COO Satish Borwankar said "going forward, alternative plans for Nano are being considered", adding, "production of Nano is no longer a viable proposition". However, he clarified the company wouldn't phase out Nano due to sentimental reasons and because shareholders wanted production to continue. "Around 1,000 Nano cars are being sold every month," he added.
