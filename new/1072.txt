Electric car manufacturer Tesla has been sued by about 126 Norwegian car owners, alleging that cars marketed with an "insane mode" of acceleration didn't go as fast as advertised. The owners claim their cars only reached 469 horsepower instead of the promised 700 horsepower. Tesla has said its cars meet requirements "according to the measurement method required by the authorities".
