British luxury carmaker Rolls Royce on Thursday unveiled its self-driving concept car ‘'Vision NEXT 100’, with no steering wheel. The 20-feet long car, expected to be entirely voice controlled, can seat just two people on one giant sofa. The vehicle will be electrically powered and is expected to hit the market by 2040.
