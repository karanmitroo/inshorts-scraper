Roborace, the autonomous racing series which will run alongside Formula E next season, has revealed a self-driving race car prototype. Participating teams during the series will build their hardware and software upon the test car's basic kit 'DevBot'. Roborace is the first global championship for driverless cars and its first season will reportedly begin in 2016-2017.
