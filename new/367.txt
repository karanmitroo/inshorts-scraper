Canada-based researchers have recycled old tyres to make a stronger variety of concrete which reduced crack formations by 90% compared to regular concrete. They included 0.35% of tyre fibres in the cement, sand, and water mix to create the reinforced concrete. About three billion tyres produced annually, if recycled for their fibres, could reduce landfills and carbon footprint, researchers said.
