German automaker Volkswagen's first fully electric car scheduled to launch in late 2018 or early 2019, will be able to run for 482 kilometres after a 15-minute charge. According to Volkswagen Chairman Herbert Diess, the car will roughly be the same size as the company's compact car Golf, but will feel as roomy as the sedan Passat on the inside.
