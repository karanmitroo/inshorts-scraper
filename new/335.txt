Beijing police have opened an investigation into the alleged illegal fundraising for the Transit Elevated Bus that was unveiled last year. According to reports, the company making the bus, which had raised $1.3 billion, has been sued by 72 investors. Powered by electricity, the vehicle could carry 300 passengers and glide over traffic, allowing cars to pass underneath it.
