Japanese automaker Mazda on Tuesday unveiled the MX-5 Retractable Fastback sports convertible car at the 2016 New York Auto Show. The MX-5 RF roof is fully automatic for the first time, which opens and closes the roof within 12 seconds. Its direct-injection gasoline engine delivers 155 hp at 6,000 rpm. Mazda will start taking pre-orders for the car this summer.
