The colour red was originally assigned to all Italian cars in the Grand Prix, but Ferrari continued exclusively producing red cars even after the tradition was stopped. Red remains the most popular choice even today, accounting for about 45% of Ferraris built over the last few years. The company's founder Enzo Ferrari died 28 years ago on August 14, 1988.
