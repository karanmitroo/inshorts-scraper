Tyre manufacturer Bridgestone has showcased its latest DriveGuard run-flat tyre at the Geneva Motor Show which enables cars to be driven for 80km at a speed of 80km/h even after deflating from a puncture. To counter the immense heat generated the technology includes cooling fins and Nanoprotech reinforced side walls, making these the most effective run-flat tyres yet.
