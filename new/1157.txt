American automaker Ford Motors has shelved its plans to introduce compact cars in emerging markets including India and China amid disappointing sales, reports said. Ford had reportedly scheduled production of its B500 range in India with an investment of $100 million. Notably, Maruti and Hyundai own about two-thirds of the Indian market, whereas, Ford's only caters to about 3%.
