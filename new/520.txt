Italian investigators on Tuesday said they had foiled a gang's plot to steal the body of Italian automaker Ferrari's Founder Enzo Ferrari from his tomb. The gang had reportedly planned to demand ransom from Ferrari's family or company. Ferrari, who died at the age of 90 in 1988, is buried in an above-ground tomb near the Ferrari plant in Italy.
