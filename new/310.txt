Volvo Trucks' new model Volvo VNL has achieved the Guinness World Record for the largest object unboxed. It was packed inside a standard box made of cardboard and cellophane, which had to completely encapsulate the truck and then needed to be opened manually. Further, the truck had to be removed from the box without destroying the box during the process.
