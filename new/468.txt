According to a Reuters report, Tesla executive Klaus Grohmann was ousted last month after a clash with the automaker's CEO Elon Musk. The disagreement was reportedly over the strategy of Grohmann's firm, which Tesla acquired in November last year. Commenting on his ouster, Grohmann said, "I definitely did not depart because I had lost interest in working."
