Audi on Monday announced that it has built a custom A8L Extended limousine for a European customer. The six-door car is 20.9 feet long, more than three feet longer than the A8L. It can accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 7.1 seconds. Notably, the four rear seats do not face one another, as they do in most limos.
