German automaker Volkswagen has teased a new electric car with self-driving capabilities and a steering wheel that retracts into the 'cockpit'. Volkswagen has called the car, which appears to look like a classic microbus, a "multi-functional vehicle for a new era." The vehicle will debut at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2017.
