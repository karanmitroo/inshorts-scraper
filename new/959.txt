Apple has reportedly given the team working on its self-driving project called 'Project Titan' a deadline of late next year to prove the system's feasibility. Apple is said to have laid off and reassigned hundreds of employees from the Project Titan team. Earlier, Apple reportedly changed directions from building its own self-driving car to only working on autonomous car software.
