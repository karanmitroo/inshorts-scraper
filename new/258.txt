Elon Musk-run American automaker Tesla on Wednesday posted its biggest-ever loss of over $336 million in the quarter ended June. However, the company's revenue more than doubled to $2.79 billion from $1.27 billion during the same period last year. Tesla said it was losing money despite receiving an average of 1,800 Model 3 car reservations per day.
