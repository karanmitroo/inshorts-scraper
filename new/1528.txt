McLaren Automotive reportedly relies on a roughly 20-year-old Compaq LTE 5280 laptop to maintain its F1 supercar. "The reason we need those specific Compaq laptops is that they run a bespoke Conditional Access card which is installed into them," a spokesperson explained to autoblog Jalopnik. However, it is working on a new interface which will be compatible with modern laptops.
