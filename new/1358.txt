Switzerland's Geneva has approved a dozen electric buses which come with a 'flash charging' technology that recharges the buses in 15 seconds. In this time, the buses receive 600-kilowatts of energy, enough to get the buses to the next station. Developed by ABB at a cost of $16 million, the buses will connect Geneva airport with a new suburb.
