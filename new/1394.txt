Tesla Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk has said that the company has no plans to disable the Autopilot feature in its cars. "A lot of people don’t understand what it is and how you turn it on,” Musk added. Musk's statement comes amid the US government's ongoing probe into a couple of Tesla crashes believed to be caused by Autopilot.
