Tata Motors on Monday said it has renamed its upcoming hatchback Zica as Tiago. The carmaker had earlier said that it will have a new name for the car, following the recent outbreak of the Zika virus in Latin America. The car, which was showcased at the Auto Expo 2016 earlier, may be launched by March-end, the company said.
