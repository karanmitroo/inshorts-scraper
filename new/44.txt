Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari's CEO Sergio Marchionne has said, "If there is an electric supercar to be built, then Ferrari will be the first." Adding that people are amazed by Tesla, Marchionne said, he is not trying to minimise what Musk did but thinks "it's doable" by everybody. Ferrari will introduce its first SUV by 2020, Marchionne added.
