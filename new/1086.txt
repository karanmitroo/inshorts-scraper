A Chennai resident reportedly took home a Kawasaki bike meant for display from a Navi-Mumbai showroom after being denied delivery of his motorcycle despite making full payment. The man asked the staff to either refund his money or give him the display bike. The showroom's dealership was terminated by Kawasaki about a week ago, citing failure to make deliveries.
