American automobile multinational General Motors reportedly tried to buy rival Ford Motor Company in 1909, but failed due to lack of $2 million in cash. Out of the total $8 million deal, $2 million had to be paid in cash upfront, but GM could not secure finances because of earlier acquisitions. General Motors was founded on September 16, 1908.
