A standard Porsche Cayenne has set a new Guinness world record for the heaviest aircraft pull by a production car by towing the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. The record was broken by a margin of over 1 lakh kg. The Cayenne, which measures 4.8 metres in length, pulled the 73-metre-long Airbus A380 at a French airport.
