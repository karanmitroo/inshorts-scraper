Skoda Octavia owners paid tribute to India's independence by creating a light trail of it on the 'journey of India'. On the 'journey', it breezes through light paintings of iconic monuments like Taj Mahal and Charminar created by the participants. The light painting created by Octavia, with its segment-first feature of full LED headlight and taillights, is one-of-a-kind in India.
