Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched the world's most powerful operational rocket carrying a Tesla Roadster car. The car will take six months to cover over 400 million kilometres in space at speeds up to 11 kilometre per second. "Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent", Musk had tweeted earlier.
