Tesla's Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler has quit the company months before the electric vehicle maker is set to launch its new car 'Model 3'. Tesla's former CFO, Deepak Ahuja, will return to the company next month to replace Wheeler. Set to launch in July, Model 3 will be the cheapest car launched by Tesla to date.
