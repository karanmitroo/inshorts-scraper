Ride-hailing startup Uber is planning to launch flying taxis by the year 2020, according to Uber's Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden. Uber will build take-off and landing pads called 'vertiports' and charging stations for the electrically powered flying taxis. To be first launched in Texas and Dubai, the flying taxis will cut a two-hour road travel time to 15 minutes.
