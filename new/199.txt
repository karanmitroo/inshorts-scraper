A 1956 Aston Martin DBR1 became the most valuable British-made car ever auctioned after it sold for about ₹145 crore last week. The car is the first of only five built, and the only DBR1 to go on public sale. Previously, a 1955 Jaguar D-Type that sold for over ₹139 crore held the record as most expensive British-made car auctioned.
