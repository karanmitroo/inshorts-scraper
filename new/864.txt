German automaker Volkswagen has reached an agreement with workers to cut up to 30,000 jobs globally and save $3.9 billion in expenses as it deals with its emissions-cheating scandal, reports said. “This is a big step forward, maybe the biggest in the company’s history,” brand chief Herbert Diess said. Earlier, Volkswagen admitted that it rigged fuel emission tests since 2009.
