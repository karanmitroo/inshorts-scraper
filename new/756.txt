Dashcam footage from a Tesla Model X in the Netherlands shows the car anticipating an accident on the highway and applying brakes to prevent collision. However, the car in front of the Tesla crashes into an SUV seconds later. Tesla's Autopilot software has a radar processing technology, giving the car the ability to see ahead of the car in front.
