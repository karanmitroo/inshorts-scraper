Ferrari has announced that it will auction off the last LaFerrari supercar ever made to raise money for earthquake relief in Central Italy. While only 499 hybrid coupes were initially planned, Ferrari will make one more for the auction. Powered by a 6.3-litre V12 engine and an electric motor, the car delivers 950bhp at a top speed of 350 kmph.
