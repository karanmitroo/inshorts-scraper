German automaker Volkswagen on Tuesday agreed to a settlement worth $15.3 billion with the US government after admitting to have rigged fuel emission tests since 2009. In the largest-ever automative buyback in the US, Volkswagen has agreed to buy back a record half a million emission cheating vehicles from consumers and provide funding to benefit makers of cleaner technologies.
