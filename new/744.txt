The truck used to barrel into a Christmas market in Berlin on December 19, killing 12 people, could have reportedly killed more if the vehicle's automatic brakes had not activated. The brakes were reportedly engaged after sensing a collision, stopping it within 250 feet. Automatic brakes have been required in trucks weighing over 3,500 kg since 2012 in Europe.
