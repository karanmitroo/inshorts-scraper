Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker Tesla has sued former Director of its driver-assist technology Autopilot, Sterling Anderson, accusing him of stealing the company's secret information. Tesla accused Anderson of trying to recruit at least a dozen former Tesla colleagues and build a new car startup. Anderson started working on his new autonomous-car venture Aurora Innovation in 2016.
