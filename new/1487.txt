The government's proposed new scrapping policy that will provide incentives for surrendering old polluting vehicles will boost the automobile turnover by over four times to â‚¹20 lakh crore, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has said. Reportedly, the new norms are likely to provide a rebate of 50% on excise duty of new vehicles for those who have surrendered their polluting ones.
