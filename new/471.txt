Elon Musk-led electric vehicle startup Tesla is recalling 53,000 of its Model X and Model S cars built between February and October 2016 over a manufacturing flaw. Tesla says the flaw prevents the electronic parking brake from being switched off. While no accident linked to the flaw has been reported, the recall has been made to ensure the customers' safety.
