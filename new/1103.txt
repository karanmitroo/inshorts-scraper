British luxury sports car manufacturer Aston Martin has teased DB11 Volante by sharing three pictures on Facebook ahead of its launch scheduled for Spring 2018. The pictures reveal that the upcoming roadster will feature a folding soft-top roof. Power for the DB11 Volante is expected to come from the automaker's all-new 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12 that generates 600 horsepower.
