The Mercedes-Benz 260 D in the W138 series was the world's first production diesel passenger car. It was presented in 1936, over 40 years after the diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The car was powered by a 2.6-litre four-cylinder engine which produced 45 hp. Less than 2,000 units of the six-seater car were manufactured.
