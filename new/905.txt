Consumer-advocacy organisation Consumer Reports on Monday released its list of 2016's most reliable car models based on road-test scores, owner satisfaction data and independent safety testing. Honda Civic, Mini Cooper and Volkswagen Jetta are among the cars no longer recommended to buyers. Japanese automaker Honda's rank fell to 10 from 8 last year on the list of reliable car brands.
