The US Justice Department is investigating whether Fiat Chrysler Automobiles had inflated vehicle sales figures, the company said on Monday. Earlier in January, a lawsuit by Illinois-based dealers had accused Fiat officials of pressuring dealers to falsify sales reports. Fiat had dismissed the claims, saying its quarterly financial reports presented a true picture of vehicles built and shipped.
