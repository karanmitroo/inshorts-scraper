UK startup Celtic Renewables has successfully completed a test drive of what is claimed to be world's first whisky residue-powered car. The startup has developed a process to manufacture the biofuel biobutanol from whisky residue like barley kernels. Using the raw material available throughout Scotland, Celtic Renewables estimates it could eventually produce 50 million litres of biofuel each year.
