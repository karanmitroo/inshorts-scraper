Elon Musk has shared a picture of a red-coloured Tesla Roadster car inside SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, which will carry it to Mars orbit. Musk said test flights usually contain mass simulators filled with concrete but for Heavy's test flight, the payload will be an original Roadster. Earlier, Musk said the rocket will carry his 'midnight cherry' Roadster to Mars.
