Vehicle assessment agency Global New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP), which conducted its first crash tests in India on five cars on Tuesday, gave zero rating to all of them over safety. The cars tested included Mahindra Scorpio, Hyundai Eon, Maruti Suzuki's Eeco and Celerio and three models of Renault Kwid. “All showed low levels of adult occupant protection,” it added.
