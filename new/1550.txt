Ford is launching an 'Intelligent Speed Limiter' feature in Europe to prevent drivers from exceeding the set speed limit. Cars will use a camera to scan traffic signs and adjust the throttle to help drivers stay within the speed limit. Cars with navigation will also be able to augment camera data with the speed limit data from the maps.
