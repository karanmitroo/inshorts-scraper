The Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) has upheld Competition Commission's (CCI) order that found automakers Ford, Nissan, and Toyota guilty of anti-competitive practices in the spare parts market. The COMPAT also imposed a 2% penalty on the companies' average annual turnover from spare parts for the three years preceding 2011, the year when the inquiry into the issue had started.
