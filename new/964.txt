Japan-based racing team D-Language claims to have created the most powerful Suzuki Swift in the world by modifying a Suzuki Swift Sport model to produce 350 horsepower. With a 1.6-litre petrol engine, the hatchback typically produces 120 hp. The car was fitted with a large turbocharger to achieve 350 hp and carbon fibre parts were added for better aerodynamics.
