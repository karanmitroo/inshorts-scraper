Japanese carmaker Toyota sold only one unit of its gas-electric hybrid car Prius in China in the second half of 2016, down from 75 in the first 6 months. Toyota stopped producing Prius in China in 2015, subjecting buyers to 25% customs tax on the imported cars. With the added taxes, Prius sedan costs at par with Audi Q3 SUV.
