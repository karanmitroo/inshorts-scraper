Tesla CEO Elon Musk has admitted that the automaker made a mistake while designing its Model X car. Musk explained Tesla tried to derive Model X SUV from the platform of its Model S sedan, which was like "trying to shoehorn something in that doesn't make sense." Tesla's upcoming Model Y is built on a completely new platform, he added.
