A Haryana Court on Saturday imprisoned 13 people for life and gave a five-year jail term to four others in the 2012 Maruti factory violence case. Further, the court said the jail sentence already served by 14 other convicts was sufficient. As many as 117 factory workers were earlier acquitted over a manager's murder at the Maruti's Manesar plant.
