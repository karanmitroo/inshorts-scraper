Car-owners in Michigan, USA turned a Rolls-Royce Ghost into a rusty taxi, in honour of popular 90's SEGA game 'Crazy Taxi'. The car is covered in a wrap to give it the look, and will participate in Motor City Rally, a sport event which started on August 3, 2016. It will travel from Detroit to Atlanta along with other cars.
