High-speed transportation startup Hyperloop One has announced the completion of its first full-scale test track in Nevada, US. The 1640-foot-long track called 'DevLoop' is big enough to accommodate real passengers and will serve as an outdoor lab for testing levitation, propulsion, vacuum and control technologies. It also revealed 11 potential Hyperloop routes across the US.
