Silicon Valley startup Atieva released a video of its electric van prototype 'Edna' outrunning a Tesla Model S and a Ferrari California in a drag race. Atieva claims 'Edna' sports a 0-100 kmph time of just over three seconds and delivers 900 HP to its four wheels. Interestingly, Atieva has a number of former Tesla employees in its ranks.
