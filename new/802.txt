Ola investor SoftBank's Founder and CEO Masayoshi Son has said that the ride-hailing startup may introduce a fleet of one million electric cars. The vehicles will be locally manufactured to support the government's 'Make in India' campaign, he added. SoftBank has already invested $2 billion in Indian startups like Ola, Snapdeal, Oyo Rooms, and Grofers among others.
