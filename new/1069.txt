German automotive company Volkswagen has withdrawn Bentley and Lamborghini from the 2016 Paris Motor Show next week as a cost-cutting measure, following its diesel emissions scandal. Earlier this year, Volkswagen had settled for about $15 billion after admitting it had used illegal software to rig diesel emissions tests. Ford, Volvo and Aston Martin will also be skipping the show.
