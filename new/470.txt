Chinese automaker GAC Motor has said it may rename its 'Trumpchi' brand before entering the US market to avoid association with US President Donald Trump. "We saw people were laughing at this... we realised it might not be very positive promotion for the brand," said a GAC executive. Trumpchi was meant to sound like the brand's Chinese name 'Chuanqi.'
