The owner of a 20-year-old Rolls-Royce car, Delhi resident Ashok Kumar Jain, has approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for its approval to let him ply his car in the city. The NGT banned plying of 15-year-old petrol vehicles in 2014. Jain says that he bought the car in 1995 for â‚¹1 crore and has the requisite pollution test certificate.
