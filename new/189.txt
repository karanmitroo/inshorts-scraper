China is planning to ban diesel and petrol cars and is working on a timetable to end their production and sales, Vice Industry Minister Xin Guobin has said. The move aims to reduce pollution and oil imports by switching to electric vehicles. Notably, France and the UK announced plans earlier this year to ban diesel and petrol cars by 2040.
