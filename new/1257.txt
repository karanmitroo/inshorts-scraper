The most expensive car ever sold is a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, which was auctioned for $38.115 million in 2014. Only 39 original 'GTO' cars were manufactured between 1962 and 1963, and the car on auction had the 'true' 3-litre V12 engine. Enzo Ferrari, who died 28 years ago on August 14, 1988, founded Ferrari in 1939.
