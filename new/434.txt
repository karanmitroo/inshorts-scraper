Ride-hailing startup Uber's Co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, on Monday shared a picture of the startup's truck division 'Uber Freight' meant for long-haul deliveries. In an interview last year, Kalanick had said it was always Uber's intention to get into trucking, adding that it is a challenging, interesting and nuanced business. Uber acquired self-driving truck startup 'Otto' the same year.
