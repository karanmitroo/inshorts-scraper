An Audi A7 testing vehicle caught fire this week while it was being tested in Austria. Photos of the burning car show that it was pulling a trailer, reportedly as part of a capability test. According to reports, the car's driver tried to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher, but the car was "destroyed" in 15-20 minutes.
