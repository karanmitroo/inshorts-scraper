In its commitment to make driving on roads safer, CEAT has released a video under the “Drive Safe Dad” initiative which shows an innovative way to curb over-speeding. CEAT would install a bobblehead, that looks exactly like your kid in your car. It syncs with the speedometer and sends a warning signal every time the car crosses the speed limit.
