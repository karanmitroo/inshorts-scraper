Danish startup Spiri has revealed a prototype of the electric car for its on-demand carpooling service set to launch in 2017. The startup has pooled talent from Aston Martin and Tesla to create the "lab on wheels". Spiri has claimed that through its system, the average passenger fare will be as low as a bus ticket.
