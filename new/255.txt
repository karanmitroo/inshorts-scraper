According to a report, ride-sharing startup Uber knowingly rented out Honda's recalled fire-prone Vezel cars to its drivers in Singapore. Honda had recalled the cars last year due to a faulty component that could cause overheating. Uber reportedly took action in January, only after one of its faulty rented cars caught fire and its interiors melted.
