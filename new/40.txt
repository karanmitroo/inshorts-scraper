Flying taxi startup Joby Aviation has raised $100 million to take its all-electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) passenger aircraft into pre-production, the startup has said. The round was led by Intel Capital and saw participation from investors including Toyota AI Ventures. Founded in 2009, the US-based startup has a working prototype of the aircraft but hasn't released it.
