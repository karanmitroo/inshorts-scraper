Automaker BMW's CEO Harald Krueger has said that the auto industry is in a "difficult situation". This comes after Germany's three largest carmakers Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW agreed to upgrade 5 million new diesel cars and offer trade-in rebates on older models at an emergency summit on Wednesday. The companies have been trying to avoid diesel bans across the world.
