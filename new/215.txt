Automaker Toyota has filed a patent for technology to make a car's A-pillars seem invisible. In the patent, Toyota describes a 'cloaking device' that uses mirrors so that light is bent around the pillars which hold the windshield in place, giving the illusion that they're see-through. The technology will help drivers see to their sides as they navigate tight corners.
