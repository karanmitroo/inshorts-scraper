In a company-wide email, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees that it's "obviously not cool" when "someone in a less represented group" sues Tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren't promoted enough. The email was reportedly sent a few days after Tesla fired a female engineer who accused the automaker of ignoring her sexual harassment complaints.
