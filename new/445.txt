India's only existing steam engine was put on display at the Heritage Transport Museum in Haryana and was opened to the public on Saturday. The 64-year-old engine, originally built by a German locomotive manufacturer, was found in a worn-out state in Bihar. It has now been restored and can be operated occasionally if a visitor wants a private experience.
