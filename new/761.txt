Tesla's rival electric vehicle startup Faraday Future has reportedly lost two of its top executives, less than a month before the debut of its first production car at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017. Marco Mattiacci, Chief Brand and Commercial Officer, and Joerg Sommer, VP for Product Marketing and Growth have been removed from the company's website.
