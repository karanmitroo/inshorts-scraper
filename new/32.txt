The Tesla Roadster car, which was launched into space by SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket on Tuesday, features a "DON'T PANIC" message on its dashboard. The space exploration startup also sent a dummy astronaut named 'Starman' in the car's driver seat. Further, a message which reads "Made on Earth by humans" is printed on the circuit board of the car.
