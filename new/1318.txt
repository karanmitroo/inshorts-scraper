American industrialist and automobile pioneer Henry Ford, who was born on July 30, 1863, had started two car companies before he founded Ford in 1903. His first company was dissolved because Ford wasn’t happy with the low quality and high prices of the cars produced. He left his second company as he was unhappy with the investors’ decision.
