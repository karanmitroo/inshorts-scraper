Germany-based luxury car manufacturer BMW plans to offer its own ride-booking service called ReachNow in Seattle, which will be later expanded to 10 US cities. Notably, a pilot version of this service was launched in San Francisco last year. The app-based service will offer a fleet of 370 vehicles, including BMW 3 Series sedans, i3s and Mini Coopers.
