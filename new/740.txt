Fiat Chrysler has revealed 'Portal', an electric concept car with double-sliding doors, ten docking stations to charge smartphones or tablets, and a selfie camera. Portal, which claims a range of over 400 km, will be able to operate semi-autonomously. It also has an internal intercom and a display at the back to encourage riders to post about their trip.
