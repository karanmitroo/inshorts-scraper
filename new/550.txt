Volkswagen slashed compensation of senior executives by 37% last year as the automaker faced criticism over past generous pay packages amid its diesel-cheating scandal. Remuneration for management-board members dropped to $42 million from $67.2 million in 2015. However, CEO Matthias MÃ¼ller's wages, benefits, and bonuses jumped 52% to $7.7 million in 2016, his first full year on the job.
