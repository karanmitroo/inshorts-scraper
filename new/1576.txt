Italian car manufacturer Maserati recently recalled more than 28,000 cars manufactured between February 2013 and November 2015 over unintended acceleration caused by broken floor mats. The notice explained that a broken mat can get trapped underneath the accelerator pedal and may result in high speeds of vehicles that have the ability to go from 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds.
