A Karachi court on Tuesday issued bailable arrest warrant against former cricketer Wasim Akram after he failed to appear before the court during the last 31 hearings of a case. Akram had lodged the case himself in August last year after his Mercedes was shot at in Karachi. Akram has been asked to appear before the court on January 17.
