Union Heavy Industries Minister Anant Geete on Wednesday called Volkswagen's emission scandal a “well thought-out crime”. He added that the German automaker has been found to violate India's emission norms by 8-9 times of the specified levels. The matter is being referred to the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways to take action against the company, Geete further said.
