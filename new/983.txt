Indian businessman Balwinder Sahani has paid 33 million dirhams ($9 million) for a Dubai licence plate for one of his Rolls Royces. Plate ‘D5’ was sold at a government auction on Saturday, the proceeds of which will go to Dubai’s Roads & Transport Authority. Notably, in the United Arab Emirates, a shorter number is a status symbol.
