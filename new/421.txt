General Motors, which markets only under the Chevrolet brand in India, will stop selling cars in the country from the end of 2017. The company will instead focus on producing vehicles for export from India, one of the world's fastest growing passenger vehicle markets. Existing Chevrolet customers will continue to be supported in the market, GM stated.
