Lapo Elkann, the grandson of late Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli, was arrested in New York last weekend for faking his own kidnapping. The 39-year-old allegedly called his family and told them he was being held against his will in Manhattan and needed $10,000 to be released. Elkann was later found to have spent the weekend consuming drugs with an escort.
