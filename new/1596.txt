Following the 2016 Union Budget, Maruti Suzuki has raised prices of its vehicles across models. An effect of the 1%-4% infrastructure cess levied on automobiles, the price hike ranges from ₹1,441 to ₹34,494. However, there are no changes in the prices of the Ertiga SHVS and Ciaz SHVS,  that are classified as mild hybrids.
