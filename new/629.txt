London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said that the city will start levying a daily 'toxicity charge' of about â‚¹800 on 'polluting' vehicles, typically registered before 2006. He described the fine as "the toughest emission standard of any world city." This will be in addition to London's Congestion Charge, which applies from Monday to Friday between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM.
