German automaker Mercedes-Benz launched the Maybach S600 Guard in India today at ₹10.5 crore (ex-showroom Delhi), making it the most expensive sedan in the country. The vehicle is bulletproof and can survive a blast of almost 15kg TNT from a four-metre distance. The company also claims that the fuel tank won’t catch fire even on a direct explosive hit.
