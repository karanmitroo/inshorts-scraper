A class-action lawsuit has been filed in California on behalf of thousands of Toyota owners who claim that the soy-based insulation used in their cars' wiring acts as bait for rats, mice, and squirrels. The lawsuit accuses Toyota of refusing to repair the damage caused by rodents chewing on the wiring under warranty. However, Toyota claims rodent damage isn't "brand-specific."
