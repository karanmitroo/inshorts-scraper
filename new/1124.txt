Ride-hailing startup Uber on Wednesday launched its first self-driving fleet for select users in Pittsburgh, US. Uber displayed a fleet of 14 Ford Fusions equipped with radar, cameras and other sensing equipment for self-driving. While a driver will always be behind the steering wheel, Uber riders will be able to see the car drive itself from the back seat.
