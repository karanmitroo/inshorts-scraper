Slovakian startup AeroMobil has put a flying car prototype 'AeroMobil 3.0' on display from July 7 to August 1 in Brussels. The car fits into any standard parking space and can take off and land using both grass and paved surfaces, just a few hundred metres long. The vehicle also features autopilot mode and an advanced parachute deployment system.
