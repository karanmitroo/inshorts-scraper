Tesla has sued a man for pretending to be CEO Elon Musk to procure non-public data about the automaker. Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler received an email signed with Musk's name requesting detailed information about the company's second quarter results. Tesla believes that the email was from an oil industry executive trying to undermine Tesla's push for energy-efficient transportation alternatives.
