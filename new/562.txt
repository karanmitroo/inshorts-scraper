Federal Environmental Agency of Germany has urged drivers to avoid using cars for the 40-day period during which Christians observe Lent. "We could change our perspectives... and at least during the fasting season switch to other forms of transportation," said an official. A discount on public transportation including regional train services has also been proposed in the country.
