Tesla's latest update 'Ludicrous Plus mode' to its Tesla S model made the car accelerate from 0-100 kmph in only 2.389 seconds. This beat the world's fastest production electric car Faraday Future's FF 91 record of 2.39 seconds by just a thousandth of a second. Earlier, Tesla Co-founder Elon Musk tweeted that even 2.34 seconds is achievable by the company.
