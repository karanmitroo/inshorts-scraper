Chinese bike-sharing startup Ofo has signed a deal to develop the 'Smog Free Bicycle' that absorbs smog and releases clean air using the power generated by pedalling. The bike is part of an ongoing project by Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde to reduce pollution levels in cities. Roosegaarde also designed the 20-foot-tall 'smog-sucking' tower in Beijing.
