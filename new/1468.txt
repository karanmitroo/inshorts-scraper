US-based car manufacturer, Local Motors has unveiled 'Olli', the first autonomous electric vehicle to use IBM's Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform Watson. Watson will help improve the passenger experience and allow natural interaction with the vehicle, IBM said. The 12-passenger vehicle will be used on public roads locally in Washington, DC, and will come to Miami-Dade County later this year.
