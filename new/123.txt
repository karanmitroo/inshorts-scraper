Automaker Toyota's Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada has said that electric cars are not ready for mass production yet, adding that he did not see Tesla as a role model. "Battery-powered cars with a long range are very expensive and it takes a long time to charge them," he said. Notably, Toyota partnered with Mazda Motor to produce battery-powered cars in September.
