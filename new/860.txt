German automaker Volkswagen has claimed that the software allowing its diesel vehicles to evade emission rules does not violate European law. "The software represents no unlawful defeat device under EU law...there's no question of manipulation," said Volkswagen. The company had agreed to a $16.5 billion settlement in the US last year for fitting the 'defeat device' in 11 million vehicles.
