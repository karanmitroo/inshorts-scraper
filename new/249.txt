Nissan Motors on Tuesday agreed to pay about â‚¹625 crore to settle the faulty Takata airbags lawsuit filed earlier this year. The settlement covers customers' economic losses because of the recall of 44 lakh Nissan cars equipped with defected Takata airbag inflators. As of late June, 30% of Nissan vehicles with the defected inflators had been fixed.
