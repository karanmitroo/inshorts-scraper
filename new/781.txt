Uber on Wednesday expanded the pilot of its self-driving taxi service to San Francisco, its second location. The self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs with a spinning LIDAR sensor and rooftop cameras will be offered to UberX riders. The cars will have a safety driver and Uber test engineer onboard to monitor the rides and take control of the wheel if required.
