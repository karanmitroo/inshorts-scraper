Dubai police have announced that they will deploy a fleet of self-driving bots that will scan people and identify wanted criminals on the streets through biometric software. The bots will have HD cameras, laser scanners, and GPS along with ability to scan license plates. They also come with drones to follow individuals to places where the bots cannot reach.
