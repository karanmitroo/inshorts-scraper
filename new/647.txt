Over $3.7 million (₹24 crore) worth of Jaguar Land Rover engines were stolen from the company's factory in Solihull, England this week. The thieves reportedly hooked a trailer full of engines to a stolen truck and drove off. The same factory witnessed a similar theft three years ago, in which the engines taken were worth $1.2 million (₹8 crore).
