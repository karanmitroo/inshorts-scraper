A 24-year-old man crashed a Fiat 500 electric vehicle into a concrete pot, which broke and injured eight people during a test drive at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday. While no one sustained life-threatening injuries, six people were hospitalised, including the driver. The driver reportedly did not have a valid driving license.
