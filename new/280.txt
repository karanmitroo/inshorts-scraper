Nissan's upcoming electric car Leaf will introduce a new feature that turns the accelerator into 'e-Pedal' at the flip of a switch. The single e-Pedal will let drivers come to a complete stop even on hills, stay in position, and resume driving instantly. The automaker claims users will be able to use the single pedal for 90% of their drive.
