Electric vehicles maker Tesla has removed the word 'autopilot' and a Chinese term for 'self-driving' from its China website. This comes after a driver in Beijing who crashed in autopilot mode accused Tesla of overplaying the function's capability and misleading the buyers. The crash, which took earlier this month, is reportedly the first known Tesla crash in China.
