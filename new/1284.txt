American automobile designer Chip Foose is building a car based on General Motors' 1935 Cadillac coupe sketch, which never became a reality. His design agency Foose Design is working to build the commissioned custom car using a 1939 Cadillac Series 60 Sedan. Scheduled to be ready for unveiling at the end of summer, Foose has named the project "Madam X".
