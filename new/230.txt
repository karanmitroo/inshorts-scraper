US-based automaker Ford last week received the patent for removable steering wheel and pedals for self-driving cars. The removable steering wheels and pedals could be attached to provide manual control of the car when required or as per customer's desire. However, reports suggested that engineers will have to reconsider how they implement airbags, which are fit in the steering wheel.
