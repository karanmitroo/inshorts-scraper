According to a documentary by National Geographic Channel, about 65% of all Rolls-Royce cars ever built since the company's inception are still on the road. The oldest Rolls-Royce still in working condition is reportedly a 1904 model owned by Thomas Love Jr. of Perth, Scotland. Saturday marked the 139th birth anniversary of Rolls-Royce Co-founder Charles Rolls.
