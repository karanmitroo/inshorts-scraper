Dutch startup PAL-V has developed a two-seater 'flying car' which it claims will be ready for sale in US for $600,000 by 2018. The vehicle takes ten minutes to convert from automobile to aircraft and hits top speeds of 170 kmph on road and 180 kmph in air. Reportedly, Google Co-founder Larry Page is also funding development of flying cars.
