Responding to the fatality believed to be caused by Tesla's Autopilot mode, the company released a statement which said, "Customers using Autopilot are statistically safer than those not using it at all." Tesla added, "To be clear, this accident was the result of a semi-tractor trailer crossing both lanes of a divided highway in front of an oncoming car."
