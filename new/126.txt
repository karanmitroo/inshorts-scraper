After a filmmaker made a luxury car-style commercial depicting a used 1996 Honda Accord, the car which was put up for sale for $499 on eBay has attracted bids over $135,000. The commercial, which boasts of features like a cassette deck and a 'rubber duckie' collection, ends with the tagline, "Luxury is a state of mind."
