Tesla car owners have sued the Elon Musk-led company for selling vehicles with a semi-autonomous driving system that behaves "as if a drunk driver is at the wheel." The lawsuit called the owners "beta testers of half-baked software that renders Tesla vehicles dangerous if engaged." However, Tesla claims the lawsuit gives an inaccurate and "sensationalistic" view of its Autopilot technology.
