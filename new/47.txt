Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said the US will have flying cars within 10 years. He also predicted fully autonomous taxis are 10 to 15 years away because of the cost of sensors and effort to create 3D maps. Further, speaking on Uber's recent legal controversies, Khosrowshahi said, "We are now going from growth at all costs to responsible growth".
