German automaker BMW has presented a motorcycle concept that eliminates the need for the rider to wear protective gear, including a helmet. The company claims that the bike has self-balancing systems to keep it upright both when standing and in motion. The bike offers riding advice and comes with a pair of glasses that span the entire field of vision.
