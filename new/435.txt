Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday shared a video of the test run of an electric sled in the first tunnel in Los Angeles by his new startup 'The Boring Company'. The sled will transport cars in an underground tunnel system to avoid traffic at a speed of 200 kmph. Musk warned the video might cause motion sickness or seizures.
