Porsche attached a 'secret' note to a Porsche 911 GT3, after it found that the car had been bought by a Honda developers team. The note attached under the engine cover read, "Good luck Honda from Porsche. See you on the other side." The team had purchased the Porsche car to assess its steering while developing the Honda Acura NSX.
