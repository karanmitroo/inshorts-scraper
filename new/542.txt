Electric vehicle maker Tesla's Co-founder Elon Musk recently joked about the company's different car model names, Model S, Model 3 and Model X, collectively forming the word 'S3X'. Musk's initial plan was to form the word 'SEXY' with Tesla cars' model names. However, Tesla's Model E was renamed to Model 3 after Ford sued Tesla to block Model E trademark.
