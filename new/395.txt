Uber has fired Anthony Levandowski, the engineer who is accused of stealing at least 14,000 files relating to Google's self-driving technology, before leaving Google and joining Uber. The engineer went on to start a self-driving truck startup Otto, which was acquired by Uber in August 2016. Google has filed a lawsuit against Uber for using Levandowski to steal its technology.
