The Land Rover Discovery Sport pulled a 100-tonne train over 10 kilometres along a railway bridge in Switzerland. The vehicle employed its semi-autonomous driving technology and its 180 PS Ingenium engine to tow the train which was 60 times its own weight. The stunt was conducted to demonstrate the towing capabilities of the all-terrain vehicle.
