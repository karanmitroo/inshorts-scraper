German carmaker BMW on Friday said it will recall 11,700 cars to fix their engine management software as it discovered that an update was mistakenly assigned to certain unsuitable model versions. Models 5- and 7-Series cars made between 2012 and 2017 containing high-performance diesel engines and three turbo chargers have been affected. However, the software was correctly developed, BMW mentioned.
