A 'new' 1996 Mercedes-Benz SL500 has been put on auction in Britain after the owner did not use the car for 20 years after losing the keys. The owner only drove the car for about 120 km before misplacing its keys. The car is expected to fetch â‚¹44 lakh, which is 10 times more than regularly used 1996 SL500 cars.
