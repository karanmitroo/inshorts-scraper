Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Sunday tweeted, "Working on top secret Tesla masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week." The tweet comes amid the ongoing investigations by the US government in two crashes involving Tesla cars. Interestingly, Musk in August 2006 published a blog titled 'The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan' where he revealed plans for new cars.
