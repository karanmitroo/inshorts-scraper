A Tesla Roadster recently launched into space aboard a SpaceX rocket could possibly be carrying the largest amount of Earth-based bacteria to ever enter space, said US-based scientists. NASA sterilises its spacecraft for extraterrestrial missions as Earthly microbes could destroy native organisms. The bacteria on Tesla could be considered a biothreat, or a backup of life on Earth, they said.
