German automakers BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and its Audi and Porsche brands have been sued for allegedly acting as a cartel for two decades. The companies called themselves 'Circle of Five' and colluded to restrict technological advances and stifle competition, the lawsuit claims. The cartel allowed these companies to price their cars higher on the premise of "superior German engineering".
