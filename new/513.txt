Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said 30% driving licences in India are bogus. "Now onwards the driving licences will be electronically registered under the umbrella of e-governance," he added. Asserting that none would get a licence without clearing the driving test, Gadkari said it would be mandatory to issue the licence within three days of clearing the test.
