Chinese authorities have ordered all vehicles in the violence-hit region of Bayingol, Xinjiang to be installed with GPS tracking devices as an anti-terror measure. "Cars are the main transportation means for terrorists, and a frequently chosen tool to carry out attacks," said Bayingol traffic police. Cars without the tracking devices will not be able to buy petrol in the region.
