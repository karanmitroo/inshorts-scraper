Aircraft maker Airbus is planning to develop autonomous flying taxis, which can carry passengers and cargo, to tackle problems of growing congestion in urban setups. Airbus subdivision A3's project, codenamed 'Vahana', plans to test a prototype of the same in late 2017. The team is also planning shared autonomous aerial vehicles that ferry passengers, which it is calling "CityAirbus".
