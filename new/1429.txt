Antamotor, a Nissan dealer in Spain, recently sold an X-Trail crossover over Twitter to a customer named Raul Escolano. Escolano had used the hashtag #compraruncocheportwitter (buy a car on Twitter) to challenge automakers across the country to sell him a car only through social networks. Nissan then gave him a walkthrough of the car through Periscope before sealing the deal.
