Google parent Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo is retiring its pod-shaped self-driving cars called 'Firefly', first introduced in 2014, in favour of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Waymo said that it is focusing on technology and not complete vehicles. "We'll be able to bring fully self-driving technology to more people, more quickly," said Waymo in a blog post.
