Ferdinand Porsche, founder of Porsche AG, unveiled the worldâ€™s first functional hybrid car in 1900, the 'Lohner-Porsche Semper Vivus'. The vehicle could travel almost 200 km on full charge, reaching a top speed of 35 kmph. Remarkably, it was also the first car with an all-wheel drive and four-wheel brakes.
