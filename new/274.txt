Elon Musk on Thursday tweeted that he has received verbal government approval for The Boring Company to build an underground Hyperloop connecting New York to Washington, DC. He further claimed that the Hyperloop will cut the time taken to travel between the two cities to just 29 minutes. Currently, it takes 3 hours and 20 minutes to cover that distance.
