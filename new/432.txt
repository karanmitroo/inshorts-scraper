Autobahn Motors has opened a vending machine in Singapore offering luxury cars, including Bentleys, Ferraris and Lamborghinis. The 15-story showroom, opened in December, is claimed to be "world's largest luxury car vending machine". Customers on the ground floor choose from a touchscreen display and the car arrives within one-two minutes through an advanced system that manages vehicle retrieval.
