Embedded with 24-carat gold and specially selected diamonds, a set of four tyres made by Dubai-based firm Z Tyre was recently sold for over $600k (approx â‚¹4 crore), setting the Guinness world record for the most expensive set of car tyres. The tyres were decorated by Italian artisan jewellers and designed in Dubai, the company said.
