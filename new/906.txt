Luxury carmaker BMW and taxi-hailing app Ola have entered into an agreement to provide on-demand luxury cab services in India. The tie-up will allow Ola cab operators to avail cheaper credit to buy BMW cars, receive after-sales support and guaranteed buyback. Ola will induct BMW cars across Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru as a part of its Ola ‘Lux’ fleet.
