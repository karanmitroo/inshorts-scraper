Ferdinand Porsche, founder of German automaker Porsche, created the world's first functional hybrid car 'Semper Vivus' in 1901. With a reported total range of 200 km, the car could cover long distances on battery power until the petrol combustion engine had to be engaged to recharge the batteries. The automative engineer was born 141 years ago on September 3, 1875.
