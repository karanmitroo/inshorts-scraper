Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla on Friday launched its Model 3 car which has no key. The vehicle connects to Tesla's smartphone app via Bluetooth to confirm a user's identity, unlock the doors, and know when to start and turn off. It'll also ship with a pair of NFC-enabled plastic cards to unlock and start the car with a tap.
