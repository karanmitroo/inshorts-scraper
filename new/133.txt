Australia's near 100-year automotive industry ended on Friday after Holden, a unit of US carmaker General Motors, closed its plant to move manufacturing to cheaper locations. "The end of Holden making cars in Australia is a very sad day for every Australian," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said. Notably, the first Australian-designed mass production car was manufactured by Holden in 1948.
