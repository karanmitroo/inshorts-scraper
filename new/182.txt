Italian automaker Lamborghini's founder Ferruccio Lamborghini started the company after an insult by Ferrari's founder Enzo Ferrari. When Lamborghini complained of a weak clutch in his car to Ferrari, he was told, "Lamborghini, you may be able to drive a tractor, but you will never be able to handle a Ferrari." Lamborghini established his company to create the "perfect car".
