A team of Indian students which lost Elon Musk's Hyperloop Challenge, has said they were unable to race their pod because of delay in its shipment. "The pod and its components couldn't be shipped in time for the pod to complete all tests and run on the SpaceX track," they said. The team entered the competition's final round in July.
