Volkswagen Group is recalling around 3,34,000 vehicles of Volkswagen and Audi brands in the US and Canada in three separate recalls, each due to fuel leaks, the German automaker said on Friday. However, no one has been injured because of these issues, a company spokesperson said. Volkswagen has not clarified if the recalls will affect vehicles outside North America.
