Fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond drove a 1930 4.5-litre 'Blower Bentley' in 'Casino Royale', the first 007 novel by Ian Fleming. Bond drove the car "with an almost sensual pleasure", wrote the author. Fleming switched Bond's car to an Aston Martin in the series' seventh book, 'Goldfinger'. Friday marked the 128th birth anniversary of Bentley Co-founder WO Bentley.
