Japan’s second-largest automaker Nissan on Thursday agreed to purchase a 34% stake in scandal-hit Mitsubishi Motors for $2.2 billion. The deal would make Nissan the single-largest shareholder in the latter company. This comes after Mitsubishi, in April, admitted to cheating fuel economy tests on its cars – including two mini car models sold under Nissan's name – several times since 1991.
