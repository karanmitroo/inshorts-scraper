US-based self-driving car startup nuTonomy's car on Tuesday collided with a truck in Singapore during an attempt to change the lane. No one was hurt in the accident where two engineers were onboard the self-driving car traveling slowly. In September, Uber's rival Grab partnered with nuTonomy to allow some users to book driverless cars via its app in Singapore.
