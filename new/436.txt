French startup SeaBubbles has shown the prototype of its 'flying water car' for the first time. Last year, the startup revealed its plans to launch a network of self-driving river shuttles equipped with hydrofoils to run car-like water taxis that rise above the surface of the waves. These electric shuttles will be used for an on-demand ferry service.
