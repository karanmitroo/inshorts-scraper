A philanthropist and a car designer have developed 'Ox', the world's first vehicle that can be packed into a flat box and shipped. The vehicle, which seats 13 people and carries over 1800 kg of cargo, can be dismantled by three people in 12 hours. It has been created to transport water, grain and building materials to Africa's developing countries.
