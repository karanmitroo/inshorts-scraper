Automaker General Motors is using aircraft-grade adhesives instead of rivets and welds to make its 2017 GMC Acadia SUV lighter by about 300 kg. The glue has been used along seams to create a stiff car body, enabling use of thinner steel. The 2017 SUV sports 23 miles per gallon (mpg) on gas compared to 18 mpg of 2016 model.
