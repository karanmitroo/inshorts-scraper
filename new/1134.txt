Ride-hailing startup Uber has released a video titled 'Pittsburgh, your self-driving Uber is arriving now', showing one of its self-driving taxis driving passengers in the US city. The self-driving cars are currently supervised by a human in the driver's seat. The fleet consists of 14 modified Ford Fusion sedans with sensors that use cameras, lasers, radars, and GPS receivers.
