Tesla has developed a new hardware suite called HW 2.5 with more computing power that will reportedly help achieve its goal of self-driving cars in case its current system proves inadequate. A Tesla spokesperson confirmed that new Model S, X, and 3 vehicles will have the hardware. Last year, Elon Musk claimed future Tesla cars will have full self-driving capabilities.
