German electrical engineer Olaf Winkler has created a self-balancing scooter with a ball-shaped wheel that can move and turn in any direction. The 'Über-ball' or 'Üo' scooter is powered by three motors with a top speed of about 12 kmph. The scooter uses 3D printed parts and is operated through a joystick at the end of its handle.
