Swedish automaker Volvo has announced that its upcoming XC60 SUV will have a software that will take over the steering and braking when necessary to avoid collisions. The system, which will operate between 60 kmph and 140 kmph, will also alert drivers if they move out of their designated driving lanes. Volvo's car will also have an animal detection system.
