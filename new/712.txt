Paris prosecutors have opened a preliminary probe into possible cheating on exhaust emissions by French automobile maker Renault. Shares of the company dropped by 6% in Paris trading, wiping $1.6 billion off its market value. Stemming from the Volkswagen probe, Fiat Chrysler has also been accused of using a computer software to cheat emission tests of its diesel models.
