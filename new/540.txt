Taxi-hailing startup Uber has admitted in court that it is unable to locate a former employee who has been accused of stealing self-driving car technology from Google spinoff Waymo. The engineer in question, Radu Raduta, is one of the three former Google employees who allegedly downloaded sensitive information before taking up jobs at Uber.
