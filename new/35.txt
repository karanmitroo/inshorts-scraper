The Beetle model used by German carmaker Volkswagen while exposing monkeys to diesel exhaust fumes as a test in 2014 was reportedly among the vehicles rigged to cheat on emissions tests. The experiment, sponsored by BMW and Daimler as well, was aimed at proving the clean emission standards of diesel vehicles. Notably, similar tests were also conducted on 25 people.
