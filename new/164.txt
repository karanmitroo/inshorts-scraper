Japanese automaker Nissan has teamed up with Dutch design brand Droog to develop seats and steering wheel which change colour due to sweat. The company uses sweat-sensing technology coating called 'Soak' applied on the steering wheel and front seats to detect if driver is dehydrated. The seat turns yellow if driver is dehydrated and blue when rehydrated.
