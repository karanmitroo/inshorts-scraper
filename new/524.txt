British automaker Vauxhall has renamed a shade of yellow Corsa cars 'Maddox Yellow' to honour 84-year-old Peter Maddox, whose car was vandalised for being "ugly". Vandals had scratched "MOVE" on the car's bonnet and smashed the rear window in January. On Saturday, a rally of 100 yellow cars from Britain drove through Maddox's village in a show of solidarity.
