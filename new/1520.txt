Google and Fiat Chrysler have agreed to work together to build a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans. Engineers from the two companies will work together to fit Google's autonomous driving technology into Fiat's Pacifica. The deal marks the first time that Google has worked directly with an automaker to integrate its self-driving system into a passenger vehicle, the companies said.
