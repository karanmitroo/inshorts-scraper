Popular television host and comedian Jay Leno this week featured the first race car ever campaigned by Porsche, in his garage show. The 1951 Porsche 356 SL Gmund Coupe had made its debut at the Le Mans Grand Prix, winning the 1100 cc class. The car was brought to the US after Porsche discarded it after the race.
