A Tesla Model X owner on Friday sued the electric carmaker claiming that his SUV suddenly accelerated while being parked. The man said the spontaneous acceleration caused the car to crash through the garage and into the owner's living room, injuring the driver and a passenger. Tesla calls its Model X "the safest, fastest and most capable" SUV in history.
