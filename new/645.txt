Electric automobile maker Tesla's CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday responded to a user's query on Twitter about the company's plans to launch its cars in India with, "Hoping for summer this year." Tesla had opened pre-orders for its Model 3 cars in India last year. Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had also asked Tesla to make India its Asia manufacturing hub.
