High-speed transport system developer Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) has not yet filed an environmental review application, delaying construction of the "world's first passenger-ready" Hyperloop track in California. In January this year, the company had said it would start construction in the middle of 2016. HTT CEO Dirk Ahlborn has blamed the delay on "bureaucratic processes".
