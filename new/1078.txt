Uber's rival Grab has become the world's second ride-hailing service to offer self-driven cars on a trial basis by launching a fleet of autonomous cars in Singapore. This comes days after Uber debuted its self-driving vehicles in the United States. Grab has teamed with driverless software developer nuTonomy for the fleet, and plans a commercial launch by 2018.
