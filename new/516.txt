Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Saturday asserted that his ministry aimed to introduce Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) compliant fuel in the country by 2020. He was speaking at the launch of BS-IV compliant fuel in the country. Notably, this comes after the Supreme Court ordered a ban on the sale and registration of BS-III compliant vehicles from Saturday.
