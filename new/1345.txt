A US federal court on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to German carmaker Volkswagenâ€™s $15.3 billion settlement deal over the emissions cheating scandal. Last month, Volkswagen had agreed to spend up to $10 billion buying back or repairing around 4,75,000 vehicles (the largest-ever automative buyback in the US) while also compensating their owners with an additional $5,100-10,000 each.
