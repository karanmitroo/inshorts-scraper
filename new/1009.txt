The world's first moving assembly line started production on October 7, 1913 at Ford's Highland Park plant. The setup had 140 assemblers stationed along a 150-foot line who installed parts on a car chassis as it was dragged across the floor. The moving assembly line helped reduce man hours of final assembly from over 12 hours to under three hours.
