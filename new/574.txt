German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday denied having any prior knowledge that auto giant Volkswagen was running an emissions cheating scam, saying she first learnt of the scandal through the media. Notably, a special commission is carrying out a probe into whether Merkel colluded with the automaker to protect it from regulators despite knowing that it was running a scam.
