German automaker Volkswagen is not considering the sale of any of its brands or a capital increase to deal with the costs of its emissions scandal. "The Volkswagen group is financially solid," its supervisory board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said. Moreover, Volkswagen has set aside $19.8 billion to meet the settlement costs for rigging fuel emission tests since 2009.
