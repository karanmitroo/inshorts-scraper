Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that the company should not be compared to major US carmakers. "I do believe this market cap is higher than we have any right to deserve," he said, adding that Tesla produces just 1% of GM's total output. Tesla's valuation crossed $50 billion earlier this year, overtaking General Motors and Ford.
