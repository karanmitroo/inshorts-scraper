Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) on Tuesday announced that it has started building its first full-sized passenger pod for commercial high-speed transportation at speeds of up to 1223 kmph. To be completed in 2018, the 100-foot-long pod will accommodate 28-40 passengers at one time. Hyperloop is aiming to send a pod in every 40 seconds on a station.
