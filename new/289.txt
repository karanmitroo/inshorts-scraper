German automaker Daimler on Tuesday voluntarily recalled over 30 lakh diesel vehicles in Europe to address concerns about the emissions systems amid scrutiny by the German government. The recall will cost the company about €220 million (over ₹1,600 crore). This will reassure drivers of diesel cars and strengthen confidence in diesel technology, Daimler officials said.
