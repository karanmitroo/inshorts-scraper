A man has created a 'drivable' hot tub in his car, wherein water is heated via coils linked to the water system of the engine. The car, which can also produce bubbles, features a barbeque grill and is covered by astroturf. Colin Furze, who has previously created a jet-powered bicycle, says, "This is the best thing I've ever made."
