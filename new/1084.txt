Luxury sports car Bugatti Chiron can suck in 60,000 litres of air per minute, almost as much as a human being would breathe in five days. Chiron, with a top speed of 420 km per hour, has four turbochargers pumping air inside the engine cylinders for combustion. The automaker's founder, Ettore Bugatti was born on September 15, 1881.
