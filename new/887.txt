Toyota has made a Bluetooth-enabled device called 'Smart Key Box' that allows users to unlock and start a car's engine by just using their smartphone. The device is aimed at people who want to share their vehicle to make money. A code on smartphone is sent via an app, which allows user to access the device acting like car's key.
