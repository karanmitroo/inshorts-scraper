Power Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday said India aims to sell only electric cars in the country by 2030. "We're going to introduce electric vehicles in a very big way...By 2030, not a single petrol or diesel car should be sold in the country," he said. Goyal added the electric car industry should be driven by "demand and not subsidy".
