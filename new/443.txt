About 38,000 premature deaths occurred worldwide in 2015 due to diesel vehicles' failure to meet official limits in real driving conditions, a study on NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions has revealed. The research found India, China, and Europe to be most affected. Further, the study shows, even if vehicles did meet emission limits, there would still be 70,000 early deaths annually.
