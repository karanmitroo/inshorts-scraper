CCTV footage of former Russian mayor Alexander Donskoy speeding his red Ferrari sports car into a shopping mall in Moscow has emerged online. Donskoy later called the incident a "funny performance" and "a way of attracting attention." The Ferrari entered the building through a loading platform ten minutes before the mall was supposed to close, a security officer said.
