Hyperloop Transportation Technologies' Co-founder Bibop Gresta has said India can have a hyperloop in 38 months if the government is serious. "We're ready with the technology and we can bring money. We just need land and a commitment from the government," he added. Hyperloop refers to a technology which transports people in pods at high speeds along specially built tubes.
