American motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson on Thursday unveiled a new-generation of flat-track racing bike 'XG750R', the company's first all-new flat track race bike in 44 years. The new XG750R features a 750 cc, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled Harley-Davidson Revolution X V-Twin engine. The company said that the motorcycle is strictly for race competition and will not be offered for sale.
