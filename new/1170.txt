Italian funeral car designer Ellena Autotrasformazioni has converted a mid-size sport sedan Maserati Ghibli into a coffin-carrying hearse. The original car body was stretched by over 64 inches using fibre glass, to bring its total length to over 21 feet. The hearse features fancy exterior styling, low-profile sport tires, 'pretend nautical leather' and a stainless steel removable cross.
