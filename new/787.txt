Apple reportedly poached the Technical Director of Porsche's race car program Alexander Hitzinger earlier this year. Hitzinger's LinkedIn profile says he left Porsche to join "a technology company" as an engineering executive. Earlier this month, Apple had revealed its plan to make autonomous vehicles in a letter asking regulators to impose fewer restrictions on developers of self-driving cars.
