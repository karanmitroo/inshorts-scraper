The first Ford Mustang was sold to a pilot, Stanley Tucker three days before the official launch  in 1964. Tucker convinced the dealership, and bought the car which wasn't meant for sale. He took serial number '5F08F100001', and became the only Mustang owner at that time. Tucker was later given the one-millionth Mustang by Ford in exchange of the car.
