Elon Musk has shared information about his new startup 'The Boring Company' that runs electric sleds in underground tunnels to carry vehicles at 201 kmph to avoid traffic. The tunnels are weatherproof, safe from earthquakes and can address any level of traffic with different layers of tunnels. The startup is looking for a technology to turn dug-out dirt into bricks.
