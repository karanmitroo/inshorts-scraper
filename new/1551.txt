Automaker Jaguar has partnered with Silicon Valley startup Tile to allow drivers to locate missing items like phones, keys and wallets. Tile makes small, waterproof tags that are affixed to objects and they beep after an accompanying app detects them within a 100-feet range. Jaguar will feature Tile as an in-car app on its 2017 Land Rover Discovery Sport.
