The 300-metre-long test track built for China's 'Transit Elevated Bus', which would glide over traffic and allow cars to pass underneath it, is reportedly being demolished. Powered by electricity, the vehicle could carry 300 passengers and was about 72 feet long and 25 feet wide. However, the concept was later called a scam to defraud investors by the state media.
