Luxury carmaker BMW on Tuesday announced an energy storage system solution by integrating new or used i3 BMW vehicle batteries. The system, which can be used for residential and commercial applications, can be charged during the day, taking advantage of the energy that may otherwise be underutilised. It can also help enable efficient use of energy produced from solar panels.
