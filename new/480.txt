Metro Skyway, a subsidiary of Israeli company Urban Aeronautics, has unveiled a plan to build a four-seater hydrogen-powered flying car called 'CityHawk' by 2022. The flying car will initially run on jet fuel, but will eventually transition to liquid hydrogen. The flying car will be designed to take-off and land vertically.
