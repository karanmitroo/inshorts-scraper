German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has said US should "build better cars" when asked what Donald Trump could do to make sure German customers bought more American cars. Trump had earlier threatened to hike taxes for cars produced outside the US. "The tax would make the US car industry weaker, worse and more expensive," Gabriel added.
