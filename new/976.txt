Ford Motor on Monday said it will shut the production of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck for a week at a US assembly plant, and temporarily idle three other plants within few weeks. About 13,000 hourly workers will be laid off. This comes amid Ford lowering its 2016 profit forecast following a charge in the September quarter for vehicle recalls.
