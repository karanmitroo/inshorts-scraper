American electric car manufacturer Faraday Future's Vice President of Design Richard Kim has stepped down from his role in the company, according to reports. Kim, who previously served German carmaker BMW as its Senior Automotive Designer, tendered his resignation earlier this week, reports added. Last month, Faraday Future fired its CFO, citing malfeasance and dereliction of duty.
