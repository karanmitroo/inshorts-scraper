Billionaire Richard Branson's spaceflight company Virgin Galactic has announced plans to revive powered test flights, nearly three years after its test vehicle SpaceShipTwo's crash that killed a co-pilot. SpaceShipTwo was 'torn apart' after the pilot prematurely unlocked a braking mechanism. Virgin Galactic's service will fly passengers to edge of space, allowing them to experience weightlessness.
