South Korean automaker Hyundai is recalling about 41,000 small SUVs (sports utility vehicles) in the United States to fix a software glitch that can stop the vehicles from accelerating. The recall covers 2016 Tucson models with seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The recall began on September 7 following pressure from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
