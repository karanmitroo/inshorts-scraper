A US government report on Monday revealed that Joshua Brown, who was killed in a crash last year while driving his Tesla sedan in Autopilot mode ignored seven visual warnings. During a 37-minute period of the trip when Brown was required to have his hands on the steering wheel, he did so for just 25 seconds, the report said.
