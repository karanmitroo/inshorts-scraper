German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt has asked Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla to stop using 'Autopilot' term in its advertisement, as this might suggest drivers' attention is not needed during driving. A Tesla spokeswoman said that the company has always made it clear to the customers that the Autopilot assistance system requires drivers to pay attention all the time.
