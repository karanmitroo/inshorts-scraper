Canada-based mechanic Tod Anderson has turned his 2006 Mercedes smart car into a car that is fit to drive on snow, at a cost of $7,000. It took Anderson a month to convert the car by replacing wheels with skis and tracks that are meant for an all-terrain vehicle. It can reach a speed of up to 70 km/h.
