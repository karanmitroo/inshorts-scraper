Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz India has slashed the price of its entire range of 'Made in India' cars by 2% to 9%. The company says the move is aimed at providing value to a customer's purchase decision before GST is implemented. Mercedes-Benz assembles nine models in India and the GST benefit will be applicable to each of them with immediate effect.
