The UK will ban the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 as part of the government's efforts to tackle air pollution by making "almost every car" zero-emission by 2050, Environment Minister Michael Gove has said. The government will allocate Â£200 million to local authorities for schemes to restrict diesel vehicles' access to polluted roads, Gove added.
