American investor Jim Chanos has said that electric carmaker Tesla is "structurally unprofitable", adding, "Three years ago, this company was supposed to be making money now." Chanos further said, "Now it's (Tesla) supposed to be making money by 2020. And I'm guessing by 2019, we'll hear about 2025." He said that Tesla is now competing against well-financed, profitable companies.
