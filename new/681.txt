Vanda Electrics has teased the all-electric Dendrobium, which is named after a type of orchid native to Singapore, as the car's automatic roof and doors resemble the flower's petals as they open. Dendrobium is considered to be Singapore's first home-grown supercar. The car is expected to have 1,500 horsepower and a 0-100 kmph time of about 2.6 seconds.
