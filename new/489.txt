Former General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz on Wednesday said that despite being a "well-known Tesla sceptic," he believes that the automaker's CEO Elon Musk is the "greatest salesman in the world." However, Lutz added that he thinks Tesla is "doomed" as rivals BMW, Volkswagen, and Audi are also coming out with electric sedans.
