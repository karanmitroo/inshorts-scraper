Porsche has thanked corporate sibling Audi "for all the tough fights" in Le Mans endurance car racing in a video. In October, Audi announced its exit from the World Endurance Championship after an 18-year run, including 13 victories at Le Mans. Audi reportedly withdrew from the championship as parent Volkswagen has been facing increased costs due to Dieselgate emissions scandal.
