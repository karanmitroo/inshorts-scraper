South Korea has banned the sale of 80 Volkswagen car models and fined the German automobile company $16.06 million. The ban, which includes cars by Volkswagen, Audi, and Bentley, comes after reports that Volkswagen had forged documents on emissions and noise-level tests. Terming the ban "most severe", Volkswagen said that it would consider a legal challenge.
