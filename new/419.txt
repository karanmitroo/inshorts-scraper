Elon Musk-led tunneling startup 'The Boring Company' has unveiled the first images of a concept bus-like vehicle that would help people avoid traffic by transporting them via underground tunnels. The vehicles will be big enough to fit several passengers and their bicycles, and will be transported on electric sleds that travel at a top speed of 200 kmph.
