A startup backed by Google Co-founder Larry Page, Kitty Hawk on Monday showed its all-electric aircraft for the first time. The aircraft has an open-air design and pontoons to facilitate its water landing. The single-rider aircraft, aiming for launch by this year's end, has eight rotors and the startup says anybody riding the aircraft would not require a pilot's license.
