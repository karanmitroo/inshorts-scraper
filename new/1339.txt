The San Diego Comic-Con this year will showcase a Honda Civic designed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise. The Sonic Civic, as named by Honda, features a vinyl wrap over parts of the Sonic Blue body with Sonic Yellow accents, with rear wheels coloured to resemble Sonic's red-and-white sneakers.
