Turkish company, Letvision, has built a working prototype transformer called Letrons that transforms all by itself. In the BMW vehicle mode, it can be driven via a remote control, and in the robot mode, internal hydraulics allow it to move body parts. The company seeks to sell these life-sized toys, which will transform from robots into various types of BMWs.
