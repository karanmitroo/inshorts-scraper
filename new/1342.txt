Mercedes-Benz has discontinued the television commercial for its new E-Class sedan over misleading automated driving claims. It compared the company's autonomous F 015 concept car with the E-Class and asked, "Is the world truly ready for a vehicle that can drive itself?" The E-Class features driver-assist system, but it requires the drivers to always keep their hands on the steering.
