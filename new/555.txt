New York is offering up to 1.3 lakh each to people who are buying an electric car or a plug-in hybrid. If a person is buying a car that also qualifies for the federal credit, the rebate on the car could shoot up to â‚¹6.6 lakh on the original price. The move is a part of the city's eco-friendly initiatives.
