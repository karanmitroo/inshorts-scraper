The first petrol-powered automobile, built by German engineer Carl Benz in 1885, was first driven around in public on July 3, 1886 in Mannheim, Germany. The two-seater wagon had a single-cylinder four-stroke engine installed at the rear which had to be started manually by rotating a circular steel frame. Twenty five production-version units of the motor car were sold.
