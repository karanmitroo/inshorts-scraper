Volkswagen has suspended its Head of Sustainability Thomas Steg after a New York Times report revealed that the carmaker funded a 2014 study that exposed monkeys to toxic diesel fumes. Steg admitted that he knew about the experiment but didn't inform the company. Steg will remain suspended until the issue of the tests is fully clarified, the company said.
