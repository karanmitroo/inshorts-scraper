Silicon Valley startup NIO has unveiled its first consumer-focused electric self-driving car concept 'NIO EVE'. The car's interior glass doubles as smart displays and an inbuilt artificial intelligence system interacts with the passengers. While the car can run 965 km on a single charge, a wireless charging system provides 320 km of travel in just 10 minutes of charging.
