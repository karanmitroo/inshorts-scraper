Automobile manufacturer Toyota has unveiled a hydrogen-powered concept car called 'Fine-Comfort Ride' which features airless tyres. The tyres, which include individual motors in each wheel, have a band of rubber encircling a plastic-aluminium hub. The airless tyres aim to help reduce the weight of battery-electric and fuel-cell vehicles to boost performance.
