Waymo, Google's new autonomous vehicle company, has unveiled a fleet of 100 Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The hybrid cars can go about 48 km in pure electric mode and are fitted with custom computers, sensors and telematics used on Google's Lexus SUV and other self-driving cars. The vehicles will debut on public roads in 2017.
