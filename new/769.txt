Google recently launched 'Waymo', a company for its self-driving vehicle division. Steve Mahan, a legally blind man from California, was among the first members of public to get a ride in Googleâ€™s self-driving car prototype in 2015 without a Google engineer onboard to take over the wheel if needed. Google is working to develop self-driving cars with Fiat Chrysler.
