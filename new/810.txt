German sports car company Porsche, which was founded back in 1931, has released a video that tells how to correctly pronounce the company's name. The video tells that Porsche is a two syllable word, that is often mistaken as one. Porsche was named after automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche, who founded the company and later worked for Adolf Hitler.
