German automobile manufacturer Porsche was the first to introduce airbags as standard equipment in its 1986 Porsche 944. The safety device was initially created as an alternative to seat belts and was offered by some companies as an optional add-on before Porsche. Ferdinand Porsche, the founder of Porsche, was born 141 years ago on September 3, 1875.
