Cars made in the 1970s had boxy designs with sharp edges, while those from the 1990s had curvier, smoother exteriors. This change was caused by a push for fuel efficiency and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to create curved shapes easily. Curved exteriors make the cars less wind resistant, thereby requiring less fuel to travel the same distance.
