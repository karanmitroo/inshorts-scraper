American automaker Chevrolet on Monday announced the sale of 100,000 units of its plug-in hybrid vehicle Volt in the US, becoming the first to reach the milestone for hybrid cars. Chevrolet reported that Volt owners drove 2.4 billion km in electric mode since the car went on sale, which the company estimates saved almost 220 billion litres of fuel.
