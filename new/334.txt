According to a report by The Guardian, several female employees at Tesla have complained about sexual harassment, mistreatment by male managers, and unfair promotion decisions at a recent town hall meeting. One woman described Tesla's factory as a "predator zone" for harassment. In June, Tesla fired a female engineer who accused the automaker of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment.
