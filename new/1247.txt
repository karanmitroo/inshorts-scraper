World's first supercar featuring a titanium body, 'Icona Vulcano' is going for sale at $2.7 million in September. Inspired by the Blackbird SR-71 plane, the car's designers, which only made one unit of the car, took 10,000 hours to craft the titanium into the shapes required. Powered by a 6.2-litre V8 petrol engine, it goes 0-100 kmph in 2.8 seconds.
