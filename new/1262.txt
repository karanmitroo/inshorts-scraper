Around 100 million Volkswagen cars sold over the past 20 years and some current models are vulnerable to theft due to hackable keyless entry systems, according to European researchers. They claim that the systems can be hacked through cheap technical devices. The vulnerable cars include most Audi, Seat and Skoda models and the 2016 Audi Q3.
