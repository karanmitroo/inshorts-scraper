Automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz became the worldâ€™s biggest luxury-car brand in 2016, marking the end of rival BMW's more than a decade-old success run. Mercedes-Benz sold around 80,000 more units of its vehicles than BMW all over the world last year to reach the top spot. Further, German carmaker Audi stood at the third spot during this period.
