Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-making startup Tesla has added an all-glass roof option to Model S for an additional $1,500 (nearly ₹1 lakh) over the base model priced at $76,200 (approximately ₹50.9 lakh). Tesla claims that the glass roof blocks 98% of UV rays and 81% of the heat. Tesla Model 3, launching next year, will feature a similar glass roof.
