Elon Musk's rival electric vehicle startup Faraday Future has released a short 15-second video clip showing its first production car riding in a desert. No sound of the engine is audible in the clip, where the company says, "Can't hear the engine? You're not supposed to". This is the first time that the company has shown its working prototype.
