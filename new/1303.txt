American industrialist Henry Ford once tried to carve out a town 'Fordlandia' in Amazon rainforests. The car manufacturer, who was born on July 30, 1863, wanted his own supply of rubber, and established a miniature Midwest factory town out of the Amazon jungle. The project, however, ended in failure without a single drop of latex procured from it.
