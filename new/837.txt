A video captured by a Tesla Model S P85D's rear-mounted dashcam shows how the car's 'instant torque' feature helped avoid a rear-end collision. The video shows a speeding Toyota Prius coming from behind the stopped Tesla car. Through the ability of Tesla's electric motors to speed up instantly, the driver was able to accelerate before the Prius collided into it.
