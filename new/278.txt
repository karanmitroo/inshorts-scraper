Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday shared the first-ever video of his new startup The Boring Company's car elevator. The startup is digging tunnels in Los Angeles and aims to create an underground network to help cars avoid traffic. The cars will be taken underground via elevators and moved to their desired destination using sleds on wheels at 200 kmph.
