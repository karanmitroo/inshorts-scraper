The N600 hatchback car, which was the first Honda car sold in the US has been restored by a professional Honda restorer, Tim Mings. Tim performed a ground-up restoration, from the interior to the car's 600-cc, 9000-rpm, two-cylinder engine. The finished car was recently showcased at the Japanese Classic Car Show in California and will be preserved in Honda's museum.
