Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla has announced plans to build three more 'Gigafactories' in addition to the ones being built in Nevada and New York. The upcoming 6 million-square-foot Gigafactory in Nevada is touted to be the world's biggest building by footprint. The lithium-ion battery factory will reportedly also have the world's largest rooftop solar array once it is operational.
