A Nissan Rogue car recently knocked down a female emcee during a demonstration of its anti-collision feature in China. The car's Intelligent Brake Assist system is supposed to sound an alarm on detecting a potential collision and automatically brake to prevent a rear-end collision. The emcee escaped with minor injuries, and the accident was blamed on "operator error."
