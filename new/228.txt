The government is planning to get 1,000 four-door Electric Vehicles (EV) for Central ministers and senior bureaucrats by November. The cars can reportedly run 120-150 km on a single charge. Notably, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd, a company promoted by state-run power utilities, is set to float global bids to install 10,000 battery operated cars and 4,000 charging stations in NCR.
