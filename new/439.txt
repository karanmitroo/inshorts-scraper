Uber on Thursday launched a new 'Uber Freight' service that connects truck drivers and independent operators with available shipments in the US. A new app will let truck drivers search for nearby available loads, see destination, distance and payment information and book delivery. Unlike the typical 30-day payment timeframe in the shipping business, Uber will pay drivers within few days.
