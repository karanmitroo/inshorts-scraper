Actor Ajaz Khan, in a Facebook video, has challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and 'Gau Rakshaks' to shut Harley-Davidson shops instead of killing innocent people. Ajaz claimed that Harley-Davidson belts are made from cow leather. He added, "I've seen many injured cows on road, get them treated, you only claim to be cow-protectors."
