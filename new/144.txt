A 3,000-km-long solar car race, dubbed World Solar Challenge, across Australia began on Sunday, featuring 42 cars in three classes. The teams in the event, which was first organised in 1987, are allowed to drive between 8am and 5pm every day. Notably, Google co-founder Larry Page and Tesla co-founder JB Straubel have participated in the challenge in the past.
