In a unique initiative, CEAT launched the #HappyRoads campaign to rid the roads of potholes in the ongoing monsoon season. CEAT put up posters encouraging people to give up their used tyres which the company used to process a new rubber-bitumen mix to make the roads 'happy' again. Thousands of people participated in the initiative.
