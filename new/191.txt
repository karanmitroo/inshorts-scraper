The US National Labor Relations Board on Thursday filed a complaint against Tesla saying it's investigating the electric car maker over unfair labour practices. According to the complaint, Tesla violated workers' rights by requiring employees at its factory in Fremont, California to sign a confidentiality agreement in order to prevent them from discussing working conditions and safety issues.
