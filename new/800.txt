Mercedes-Benz has unveiled a headlight system called 'Digital Light' that can project HD images onto the road. The headlights can display navigation directions or the width of the car when trying to squeeze through a gap. The system uses computer chips and mirrors to display the images and can adapt to its environment to adjust the brightness of the beam.
