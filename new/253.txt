Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday revealed that about 63,000 pre-orders of Model 3 cars have been cancelled in a year. However, Tesla is still receiving an average of 1,800 orders daily with about 4.5 lakh in total so far, since bookings began in 2016. While launching Model 3 earlier this week, Musk said producing it will be "manufacturing hell".
