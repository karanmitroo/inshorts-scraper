Japanese motorcycle maker Kawasaki recently terminated the dealership of SNK Palm Beach in Mumbai for failing to deliver motorcycles booked by users and issuing refunds for the payments made. In a statement, Kawasaki added that the dealer "had committed material breaches of the terms and conditions of the dealership". Some customers have reportedly filed FIRs against the dealership.
