German luxury carmaker BMW has mocked electric vehicle maker Tesla in two new advertisements of its 2016 BMW 330e plug-in hybrid version of its 3-Series sport sedan. "You will wait, and wait, and wait some more, all before that electric-car company’s new model ever even arrives,” says the advertisement. Notably, Tesla's Model 3 is scheduled to launch in late 2017.
