Due to a mismatch in China's demand for Tesla Model X and Tesla's limited supply, grey-market Tesla Model X cars sell for $70,000 extra markup price in China. A private seller is reportedly buying the $170,000 cars and selling them to Chinese customers at $240,000. Though these imports are legal in China, the warranties on the cars have been voided.
