According to media reports, Google and Ford are creating an independent company for developing self-driving cars. The partnership is non-exclusive, meaning Google would still be able to collaborate with other automakers for the same. Further, the new company will be legally separate from Ford. The partnership is expected to be officially announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.
