The new hatchback from Tata Motors, called the Tiago, will be launched on the 28th of March. The car was renamed to Tiago since it's original name 'Zica' sounded similar to the Zika virus. The hatchback gets petrol and diesel motors with a manual gearbox, an 8 speaker Harman sound system and optional color coded interiors.
