In a new track test, Tesla's Model S car accelerated from 0-100 kmph in 2.275 seconds using the recently-updated 'Ludicrous+' mode. Tesla's fastest production electric car beat its own record time of 2.389 seconds. The car was previously recorded as being quicker than Faraday Future's FF 91 by just a thousandth of a second.
