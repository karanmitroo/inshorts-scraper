McLaren has unveiled a rotating display on its dashboard, which will be featured on its upcoming Super Series car. Drivers can select the larger screen with more options for regular driving, while the folded display is meant for racing. The display will automatically slide down to show current gear and speed information when the car is put in track mode.
