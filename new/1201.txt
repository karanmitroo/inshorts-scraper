The first Rolls-Royce car ever made was a 10 horsepower model which sold for £395 (1 British Pound equals ₹88 at present) in 1904. Only 17 of these cars were produced by Henry Royce's company and sold by Charles Rolls' dealership, before they officially founded Rolls-Royce in 1906. Saturday marked the 139th birth anniversary of the founder Charles Rolls.
