The Academic Motorsports Association Zurich has built the world's fastest electric car 'grimsel', which can accelerate from 0â€“100 kmph in 1.5 seconds. Made mostly of carbon fiber, it uses a four-wheel drive, and has an onboard computer. The previous record of 1.7 seconds was held by an electric race car made by the University of Stuttgart.
