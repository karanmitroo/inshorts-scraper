French luxury car brand Bugatti is considering developing a four-door limousine. CEO Wolfgang Duerheimer said, “I can’t get the idea for a four-door limousine out of my head. It’s one of the options… as a possible next project.” Notably, Bugatti recently launched the world's fastest production car Chiron, which can go from 0 to 100km/h in under 2.5 seconds.
