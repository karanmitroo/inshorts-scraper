Swedish automobile manufacturer Volvo has recalled more than 1.27 lakh vehicles globally over an air-conditioning system fault. The air conditioning system may reportedly leak water into the vehicles and eventually lead to a malfunction of the airbags. The recall includes 2016 and 2017 XC90 SUVs, S90 sedans and V90 wagons, and is expected to officially start from November 14.
