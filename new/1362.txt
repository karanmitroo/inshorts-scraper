Electric vehicles maker Tesla has dropped 'Motors' from its web address. The company had reportedly acquired the new web address earlier this year and started shifting its employees' emails to the new domain. Earlier this month, Tesla Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk had tweeted, "Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week."
