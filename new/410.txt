Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's delivery arm Cainiao Network has announced $7.3 billion investment to produce 10 lakh smart delivery vans. A computing system will analyse real-time orders and design the most efficient routes for the delivery fleet. Earlier in a pilot run, the smart vans travelled 30% shorter distances and saved 20% of the operational costs.
