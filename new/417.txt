Uber has dropped the name 'Otto' of its self-driving truck unit and changed it to 'Uber Advanced Technologies Group' following a trademark infringement dispute. A Canadian robotic vehicle technology company named Otto Motors had sued Uber over similar names. Uber bought the self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million in August 2016.
