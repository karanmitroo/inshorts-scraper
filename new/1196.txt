In the 1920s, the Maharaja of Alwar bought seven Rolls-Royce cars for collecting municipal garbage after being ignored by a salesman in a showroom in London. The present Maharaja, Jitendra Pratap Singh, once said that even now the royal family has "numerous vintage cars but not a single Rolls". Saturday marked the 139th birth anniversary of Rolls-Royce Co-founder Charles Rolls.
