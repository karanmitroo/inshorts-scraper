The MY17 Nissan GT-R made its global appearance at the New York International Auto Show. It comes fitted with a 3.8 litre V6 24-valve twin turbocharged engine that generates 565 hp and 633 Nm of torque. The handling has been improved by employing a more rigid body structure and a new suspension set up that allows for better lateral transitions.
