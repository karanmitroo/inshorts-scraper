German automaker Porsche's subsidiary Porsche Design has made a speaker out of a Porsche 911 parts. The 911 Soundbar, made out of a GT3's muffler system, replaces woofers with exhaust pipes, which deliver sound at a maximum volume of 99 decibels. Priced at $3,500, the limited edition speakers also feature a 2.1 virtual surround system and wireless, lossless audio transmission.
