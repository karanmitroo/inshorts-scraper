Electric vehicle maker Tesla's Co-founder Elon Musk has said that he was a dumb idiot to name the startup's upcoming car 'Model 3'. "Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the "next version" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true," tweeted Musk. Tesla claims that Model 3 will be its most affordable car.
