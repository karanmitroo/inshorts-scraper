The parent company of Mercedes-Benz, Daimler, has trolled billionaire Elon Musk over his recent tweet on the German automaker. Daimler last week announced its plan to invest $1 billion in producing electric vehicles in the US, to which Musk tweeted that Daimler should invest over $1 billion. Daimler replied by showing off the amount of its investments in electric vehicles.
