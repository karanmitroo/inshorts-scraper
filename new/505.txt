The Cabinet on Friday decided to link issue of driving licences and vehicle registration to Aadhaar as part of the amendments approved under the Motor Vehicles Bill. The bill further proposes higher penalties for traffic offences, including fine and three-year jail for parents of minors caught driving and causing fatal accidents. Aadhaar was earlier made mandatory for filing I-T returns.
