According to reports, a driverless car seen in Virginia, US last week was being driven by a man disguised as car seat. The man was reportedly spotted wearing a beige and black disguise holding the steering wheel. It was later confirmed he was part of a research by Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and wore the outfit to minimise his visibility.
