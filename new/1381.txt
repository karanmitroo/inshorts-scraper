The first Jeep prototype was designed in 75 days by Willys-Overland Motor Company and delivered to the US Army in November 1940. The prototypes were called ‘Quad’, due to the four-wheel drive system equipped in them. Only two units of the prototype were built and it turned into the final production model, the Jeep Willys MB.
