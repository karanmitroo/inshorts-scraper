Electric carmaker and Tesla rival Faraday Future has accused its former CFO Stefan Krause of stealing trade secrets and attempting to recruit its employees. It has also filed a lawsuit against Krause's electric car startup Evelozcity over trade secrets theft. Interestingly, Krause was fired by Faraday Future last year over dereliction of duty.
