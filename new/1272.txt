A professional ice sculptor, Jack Hackney, has created functional car wheels made out of ice. The wheels which were tested on a Lexus NX consist of machine cut ice attached to a transparent acrylic rim which helps to support the weight of the car. A three-minute video explains the process of creation of the wheels.
