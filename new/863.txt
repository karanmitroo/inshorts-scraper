Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralf Speth has said that half of the company's new vehicles will be offered with the hybrid or electric option by 2020. "We are developing our own approach to autonomy, connectivity and electrification," he said. The Tata Motors-owned automaker recently unveiled its first all-electric Jaguar I-PACE SUV concept at the Los Angeles Auto Show.
