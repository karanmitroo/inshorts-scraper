World's first hybrid 'aeroboat', which has been designed to access difficult terrain and can travel on land, water, snow, and sand, has been unveiled in Moscow. It is built by an Indo-Russian JV between International Institute for Advanced Aerospace Technologies and Indian firm Millennium Aerodynamics. The 6.5-metre-long aeroboat has space for 10 passengers and can travel at over 150 kmph.
