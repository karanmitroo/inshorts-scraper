India’s biggest automobile company Tata Motors on Thursday reported a 2% year-on-year drop in its net profit to ₹3,507.54 crore for the quarter ended December. Net sales, however, increased by 3.71% to ₹71,686.12 crore. The company attributed the fall in its profit to factors like higher depreciation and amortisation expenses and non-recurrence of an annual China tax rebate.
