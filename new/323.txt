Elon Musk-led American carmaker Tesla has fallen from rank 4 on MIT Technology Review's 50 Smartest Companies list last year, to rank 31 this year. The startup's position was affected by maintenance problems and issues with its Autopilot feature, MIT said. However, Musk's space exploration startup SpaceX has been ranked 2 on this year's list, up from 16 in 2016.
