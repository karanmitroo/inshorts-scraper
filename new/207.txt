General Motors this week admitted that some units of its recently-launched electric Chevrolet Bolt have been showing more range than they actually have. The automaker said the fault was caused due to lower battery voltage and only affected 1% of the 10,000 Bolts on road. The company said it could fix the issue by repairing or replacing the faulty batteries.
