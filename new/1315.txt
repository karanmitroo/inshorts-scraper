China's elevated bus-transit concept, named "Transit Elevated Bus", recently completed its first road test run in the Qinhuangdao city. The test run featured a single bus carriage traveling over the traffic on a 300-metre long controlled track. Powered by electricity, the vehicle can carry 300 passengers and is about 72 feet long and 25 feet wide, spanning multiple traffic lanes.
