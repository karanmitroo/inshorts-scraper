Volkswagen has unveiled a concept for its autonomous car Sedric, short for "self-driving car", which can be summoned by a button. The remote will also ring to indicate Sedric's arrival and vibrate to guide a person with impaired vision to the car. Volkswagen claims the car will be able to recognise its users and open its doors to them automatically.
