American automaker Jeep, which turned 75-years-old on Friday, has made a World War II-themed Wrangler concept that pays homage to the Willys MB, a utility vehicle which was manufactured during the war. The jeep's exterior features an olive-drab color scheme that was first seen on military vehicles 75 years ago. It is powered by a 3.6-litre Pentastar V-6 engine.
