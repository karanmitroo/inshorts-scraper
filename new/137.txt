Automobile manufacturer Toyota has revealed a personal mobility device called 'Concept-i Walk' primarily intended to be used on sidewalks. The device takes up the same physical space as a person walking, and can anticipate and avoid collisions automatically, Toyota claims. It features three wheels with a wheelbase variable mechanism, lowered floor, and a joystick-style steering function.
