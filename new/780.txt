Uber has been ordered by regulators to stop testing its self-driving cabs in San Francisco after they were launched on Wednesday. Uber was asked to secure the necessary permit that allows companies to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. However, Uber claims it doesn't need the permit as there is always a standby human driver present in its self-driving cabs.
