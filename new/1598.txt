Renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking has made an appearance in Tata Motors-owned Jaguar’s new commercial for its first performance SUV called the F-PACE. The commercial shows Hawking as a “typical British villain” who is the “master of time and space”. Interestingly, Hawking has earlier made on-camera appearances in various shows and movies including 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'Star Trek'.
