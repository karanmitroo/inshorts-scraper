American automaker Ford has developed a hat that senses a driver's head movements associated with sleepiness and wakes them up using sound, light, and vibration. Called SafeCap, it also features an inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope that measure head movements while driving. Ford developed the hat in partnership with Brazil-based creative agency GTB.
