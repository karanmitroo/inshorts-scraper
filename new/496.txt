Mike Jackson, CEO of US' largest auto dealership chain AutoNation, has called Tesla's valuation "totally inexplicable" after it briefly passed General Motors to become the most valuable carmaker in the country. Jackson added that Tesla could be "the great Ponzi schemes of all time." However, he also lauded Tesla CEO Elon Musk for creating a brand with "strong, cult-like following."
