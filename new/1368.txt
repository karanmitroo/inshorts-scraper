The first vehicle of Henry Ford, widely regarded as the pioneer of the automobile industry, had a tiller instead of a steering wheel. The vehicle, made in 1896, was powered by a four horsepower engine with only two forward gears and no reverse gear. He later founded the Ford Motor Company, which sold its first car on July 23, 1903.
