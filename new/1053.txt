German automobile manufacturer Audi has suspended the sales of its Q5 SUV in India after Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) found emission level from the model higher than the prescribed limit. "We have conducted testing of the solution in Q5 vehicles with ARAI," said an Audi spokesperson. The company is waiting for ARAI's approval for the proposed fix.
