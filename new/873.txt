South Korean carmaker Hyundai's subsidiary Kia Motors recently unveiled an off-road SUV named 'Sorento Ski Gondola', which has triangular tanks tracks instead of wheels. It combines all-terrain capabilities and autonomous technology, allowing users to control the vehicle via a tablet located inside the cabin. The SUV's interior is waterproof to protect against ice and snow.
