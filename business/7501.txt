Terming taxation laws in India as “ill-defined”, NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Arvind Panagariya has called for removing ambiguities in them, adding that tax reform is "really important" to curb black money. Further, “Demonetisation is one of the steps to stop creation of black money but a lot more needs to be done,” he added.
