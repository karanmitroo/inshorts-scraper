Citigroup sued AT&T on Friday, saying the company's use of "thanks" and "AT&T thanks" in a new customer loyalty program infringed its trademark rights to the phrase "thankyou." Citigroup has been using the "ThankYou" trademark in its customer-loyalty program since 2004 and said that the "AT&T thanks" program launched on June 2 is likely to cause confusion among customers.
