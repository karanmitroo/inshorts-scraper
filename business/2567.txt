Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that television programmes create a panic by saying that inflation jumped 70% to 3.4%, adding that statistics should not be played to an illogical level. He said India is consistently within the range of 4% inflation target. He further said that spike in vegetable prices during monsoon contributes to the higher inflation.
