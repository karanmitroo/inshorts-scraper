According to reports, telecom firm Vodafone has moved the International Court of Justice (ICJ) urging it to intervene in the retrospective taxation case with the Indian government. Notably, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley earlier said that companies facing such issues could either pay the principal amount of the retrospective tax and get a waiver from interest and penalty or continue litigation.
