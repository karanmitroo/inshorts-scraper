Shares of restaurant operators near Tokyo's main zoo surged after a panda was born for the first time in five years. Totenko, which operates a Chinese eatery within walking distance of the zoo, jumped 38% while French restaurant Seiyoken advanced 11% expecting a boost in tourism. The companies' stock surged earlier also when the zoo announced the pandas were mating.
