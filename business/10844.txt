The benchmark Sensex and the broader Nifty lost nearly 1% in the week ended June 24. While the BSE Sensex fell 228.20 points to settle at 26,397.71, the NSE Nifty lost 81.60 points to close at 8,088.60. The drop was primarily attributed to a significant fall in the indices on Friday following the UK's decision to exit the European Union.
