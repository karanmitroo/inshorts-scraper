Nirav Modi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has said the jeweller may return to India only if the prosecution assures him of a free and fair trial. "He (Nirav Modi) would not have left the huge wealth...had he intended to flee the country permanently," Aggarwal added. Notably, Nirav Modi left India on January 1 before the FIR was registered in PNB fraud.
