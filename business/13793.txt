Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the move to ease Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regulations in 15 sectors like civil aviation and banking shows the central government's "unequivocal and unwavering" commitment to reforms. "Today's reforms are another example of emphasis on Minimum Government, Maximum Governance," the PM further added.
