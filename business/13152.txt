Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha on Friday said that non-passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill would be a blow to the Indian democracy, economy and the overall development process. Sinha added that even though almost all political parties are in favour of the measure, all efforts have been in vain due to Congressâ€™ resistance.
