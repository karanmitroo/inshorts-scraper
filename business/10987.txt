The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty on Monday closed on a flat note after they fell by 1.06 and 1.75 points to settle at 26,395.71 and 8,108.85 respectively. Investors remained hesitant amid the wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation in May expanding to 0.79% from 0.34% in April and fears over UK's exit from the European Union, analysts said.
