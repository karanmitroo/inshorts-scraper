The Bombay Stock Exchange resumed trading after a halt of over 3 hours on Thursday but the network glitch is likely to hit day traders and arbitragers the most. BSE was trading 0.08% higher at 25,862 at 01:00 p.m. This is the second time in two months, when BSE has faced such a glitch. However the NSE remained operational.
