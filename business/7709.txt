The Finance Ministry on Thursday issued a statement allowing payments of up to ₹500 towards prepaid mobile top-ups using old ₹500 notes until December 15. This comes after the government cancelled exchange of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes at banks after November 24 midnight. It said this decision was taken after observing a declining trend in exchange of old notes.
