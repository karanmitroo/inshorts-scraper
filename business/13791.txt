Trade and commerce association ASSOCHAM on Thursday reportedly said that the European Union (EU) and India have “no likelihood” of reaching a consensus on Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations in the "near future". ASSOCHAM suggested that considering the “complex nature of the EU structure and its vast internal issues”, India should try to establish “an independent FTA with the UK".
