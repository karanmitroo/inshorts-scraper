Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said more than 1.75 lakh shell companies with doctored accounts have been deregistered based on data mined from demonetisation. He further said around 400 firms were found to be operating from a single address, and 18 lakh people have been found so far whose income disclosed in tax returns is lower than actual earnings.
