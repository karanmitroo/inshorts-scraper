US President Barack Obama has ruled out drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean to save the "fragile and unique" Arctic ecosystem from "significant risks", reports said. Notably, this comes after US President-elect Donald Trump vowed to "lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks" against large fossil fuel projects. The ban will be in effect from 2017 to 2022.
