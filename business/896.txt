World's biggest hotel chain Marriott International mistakenly listed Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which are claimed by China as part of its mainland, as countries in a customer survey. Following the error, China closed Marriott's Chinese website, launching a probe into whether it violated national laws. Marriott has apologised for the error and said it respects China's territorial integrity.
