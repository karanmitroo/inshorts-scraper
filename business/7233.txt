Around 48.63 lakh workers in the unorganised sector in Delhi may become unemployed due to “faulty implementation of demonetisation”, Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken claimed. “Lakhs of labourers have already returned to their homes, and around 15,000 labourers are returning to their homes from Delhi every day,” he said. This is stalling development works in the national capital, he added.
