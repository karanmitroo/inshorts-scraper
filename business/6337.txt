Samsung has said it will disband its corporate strategy office after investigation by a special prosecutor's office ends. The unit is under scrutiny for the role of its top officials in a bribery scandal that led to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's impeachment. Investigations relate to whether payments Samsung made to foundations of a Park confidante were for political favours.
