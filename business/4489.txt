After CBI registered a case against NDTV Co-founders Prannoy Roy and wife Radhika Roy over bank fraud, the channel said it'll fight against "this witch-hunt". "The CBI stepped up the concerted harassment of NDTV...based on the same old endless false accusations," it said. The case is about a loan default allegedly causing a loss of â‚¹48 crore to a bank.
