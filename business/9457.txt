Tata AIG General Insurance and Paytm have entered into an agreement to enable cab and auto drivers, who are using Paytm’s digital wallet, to avail cashless health insurance. While subscribing to the policy, the existing health condition of drivers will also be covered under this scheme. The new health insurance scheme will cover hospitalisation expenses of up to ₹50,000.
