Former Kingfisher Airlines employees have said their main concern is the recovery of their unpaid salaries and extradition of Vijay Mallya. "Our main concern is that the government should get him to India and we should get our dues," they said. According to an open letter written last year, Mallya owes â‚¹300 crore as salary dues to over 3,000 employees.
