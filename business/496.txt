CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra on Monday urged industries to not misuse provisions of laws to evade taxes. He said the effective tax rate for big companies is already "quite good" at 26% due to various exemptions. He further said the industries have to act more responsibly than a salary earning person and help build a tax compliant society.
