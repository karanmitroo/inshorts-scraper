The BSE Sensex on Wednesday fell by 59.24 points to close at 28,005.37 points while the NSE Nifty lost 18.50 points to settle at 8,624.05 on account selling in power, IT and several FMCG stocks. Market sentiment was dampened by the rise in wholesale price index-based inflation to a two-year high amid weak global cues, analysts said.
