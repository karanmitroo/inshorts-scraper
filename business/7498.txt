Venezuela's central bank said it will issue new higher-value notes of its currency, the bolivar, from mid-December to aid consumers who are dealing with unprecedented inflation. This comes after bolivar suffered its largest monthly fall, down 60% in November against the dollar on the black market. Currently, the largest bolivar note is worth $0.02 (around â‚¹1.36) on the black market.
