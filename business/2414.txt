Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said demonetisation was a shake-up which achieved its "principal objectives" of decreasing cash transactions, expanding the tax base, and increasing digitisation. He said "confiscating" the money was not the aim. Referring to the "principal objectives", Jaitley added that note ban helped in reducing the reliance on cash, particularly high denomination currency.
