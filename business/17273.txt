SpiceJet on Tuesday extended its special monsoon fare offer with a starting ticket of Rs. 1,999 (all inclusive) pan-India. The bookings under the extended offer can be made from Jun-17 to Jun-19 with a travel period validity starting from Jul-19 and lasting up to Sept-30. SpiceJet had last week announced this scheme for its flight from eight South Indian cities.
