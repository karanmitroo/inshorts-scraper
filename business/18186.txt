To provide more employees with an opportunity to work abroad, Infosys has introduced an onsite rotation policy for employees under which an employee cannot stay overseas for client-specific work for over 18-months. The policy could however lead to higher costs and administrative work due to the requirement of more visas. TCS and Wipro already use onsite rotation policies.
