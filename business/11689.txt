DBS Bank, which is Singapore’s largest, unveiled Digibank, India’s first mobile-only bank, targeting five million retail customers. The bank said that customer authentication would be done solely using the Aadhaar card, as there is no paperwork involved. Digibank would bring together an entire suite of technology — from biometrics to artificial intelligence (AI) — for customers, it added.
