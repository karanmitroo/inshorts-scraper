The US Department of Justice on Friday announced that it has fined Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis $390 million for granting illegal kickbacks to pharmacies for recommending its drugs. In the settlement deal, Novartis admitted to offering exceptional rebates to certain speciality pharmacies for urging patients to continue taking its medicines and downplaying their side-effects.
