Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Tuesday said Air India has not made any operating loss this year, even though its financial condition remains "precarious". An external loan of $300 million has been approved to improve finances, he added. Air India has reportedly recruited 265 pilots and 902 crew members in the last one year to improve its performance.
