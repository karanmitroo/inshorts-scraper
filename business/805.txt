HSBC has agreed to pay $101.5 million to settle a US criminal probe into rigging of currency transactions. The bank had admitted that its traders misused confidential information provided to them by clients to make a profit. Last year, a former HSBC executive Mark Johnson was found guilty of defrauding Cairn Energy in a $3.5-billion currency trade in 2011.
