Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan on Wednesday said the board of IT major Infosys is blaming Co-founder Narayana Murthy over Vishal Sikka's exit as CEO "just to hide its own failures". Murthy has done a great service to stakeholders by bringing corporate governance issues to the fore and requesting accountability in the long-term interest of the company, he said.
