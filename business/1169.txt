A Burger King franchisee in the US has agreed to pay $250,000 (â‚¹1.6 crore) after investigators found 843 child labour violations in its restaurants in Massachusetts. Investigators said the franchisee employed minors who worked too long, too late and without proper work permits. They added that in one instance, a 16-year-old worker stayed on the job until nearly 5 am.
