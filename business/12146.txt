In a bid to boost the manufacturing sector and 'Make in India' initiative, the union cabinet on Wednesday cleared the National Capital Goods Policy. The move aims to increase the domestic production of capital goods – from ₹2.30 lakh crore in 2014-15 to ₹7.5 lakh crore by 2025. Presently, around 40-45% of the capital goods demand is met by imports.
