Delhi state consumer panel has directed SBI to refund ₹1.29 lakh to a customer for not taking effective steps to block her stolen ATM card in 2006. It also imposed cost of ₹1 lakh on SBI for filing a "frivolous" appeal. It's a case of deficient service as the complainant hasn't received a single penny in 11 years, it noted.
