Real-estate firm Unitech on Saturday said that two of its directors have resigned from the company. Minoti Bahri, a non-executive director of the company and Dilip Kumar Malhotra, an additional non-executive independent director have resigned. Unitech is facing huge protest from home buyers because of delay in completion of about 70 projects involving more than 16,000 flats.
