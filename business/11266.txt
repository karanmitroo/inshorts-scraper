The government has saved â‚¹36,000 crore in the 2015-16 fiscal by weeding out fake beneficiaries of various welfare schemes after linking the Aadhaar cards with bank accounts, Union Minister Anant Geete said on Friday. "At the same time, the digitisation of ration cards, has helped the government to identify and remove nearly 3.5 crore bogus ration card holders," he added.
