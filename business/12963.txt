The worldâ€™s largest oilfield service provider, Schlumberger, on Thursday said it'll cut  10,000 jobs to cope with the oil market collapse. This comes after the company posted its lowest revenue in five years ($7.74 billion) in the December quarter. The global energy industry slashed more than $100 billion in spending and 2,50,000 jobs last year amid the oil rout.
