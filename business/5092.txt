Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker has said US President Donald Trump is a "very wise individual and a very good businessman". His comment came in response to US airlines asking the government to prevent Gulf airlines from expanding aggressively in the US market. In this regard, Al Baker suggested Trump was unlikely to be "bullied" into accepting these demands.
