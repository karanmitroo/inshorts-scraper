Due to fall in global oil rates, petrol and diesel prices are likely to be cut by around Re 1 per litre this weekend. This would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and third in diesel rates since October.  Rates will be reduced if the current trend of declining international oil prices continues, industry sources said.
