McDonald's estranged partner Vikram Bakshi on Tuesday said CPRL has re-opened 18 out of the 43 McDonald's restaurants that had shut down in June on account of non-renewal of eating house licences. CPRL is the north and east India licencee of McDonald's, and operates 169 outlets. Notably, this comes in the backdrop of McDonald's terminating its franchise agreement with CPRL.
