Residents of Khawbung village, Mizoram are using pieces of paper as promissory notes till the new notes of ₹500 and ₹2000 come into circulation. The papers bear the amount and the signature of the issuer on them. "It was almost impossible to buy or sell anything unless we made an alternate arrangement," said one of the villagers.
