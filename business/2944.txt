Reliance Jio's website crashed after pre-booking for the "effectively free" JioPhone started on Thursday evening. The website displayed "Content Server Error" around 5.30pm. Further, a store in central Delhi claimed to have booked about 100 units of JioPhone in offline mode within 15-20 minutes. However, the rush wasn't as heavy as seen at the time of Jio SIM purchase.
