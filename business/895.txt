The UIDAI has extended the temporary permission given to Airtel for using Aadhaar for re-verification of its mobile customers from January 10 to March 31. However, UIDAI maintained that Airtel Payments Bank's eKYC licence will remain suspended. Airtel was accused of using the Aadhaar-eKYC based process to open payments bank accounts of subscribers without their consent.
