German carmaker Volkswagen on Monday reported a rise of 56.83% in India sales last month at 4,167 units as compared to 2,657 units in May last year. The surge in sales has been driven by the new sedan Jetta and hatchback Polo. "We remain confident of continuing to improve our sales figures further over the coming months", said an official.
