Bharti Airtel has filed an application in telecom tribunal TDSAT objecting to alleged delays by Reliance Jio while withdrawing its 3-month complimentary offer as directed by TRAI. Airtel further objected to the continuation of scheme’s benefits for those who had already subscribed to the offer before it was withdrawn. TRAI asked Jio to remove the offer in “shortest possible time”.
