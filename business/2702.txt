Germany-based supermarket chain Lidl has apologised for removing church crosses from images of the Anastasis Church on its Greek food range packaging, after facing criticism. "We are sorry for any offence caused by the artwork...we will be revising the design as soon as possible," Lidl said. Lidl said its product design was not intended to convey any ideological standpoint.
