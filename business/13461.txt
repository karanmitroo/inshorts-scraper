US Crude price slipped to $36.64 a barrel on Tuesday, thereby collapsing below $37 for the first time since February 2009. Meanwhile, Brent crude also fell below $40-a-barrel for the first time in over six years to $39.81. The oil prices extended Monday's 6% rout, which followed the OPEC's failed attempt on Friday to reach a consensus on production ceiling.
