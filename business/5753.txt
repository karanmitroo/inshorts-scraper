Telecom regulator TRAI has asked international SIM card and global calling card firms to explain unsatisfactory service quality provided to consumers when travelling abroad. TRAI asked 8-9 players about poor service, which caused inconvenience to customers. The issue could prompt TRAI to tighten quality measures like mandating a toll-free number where consumers can call for help, an official said.
