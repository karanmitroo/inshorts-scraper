Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan dismissed reports that University of Chicago's refusal to extend his leave forced his departure from RBI. "The university has been very good to me. They were happy to give as much leave," he said. Rajan added he didn't 'knock at government's door' for an extension but "indicated a willingness to stay" to address bad loans.
