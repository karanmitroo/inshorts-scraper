The US almost tripled the price of coal shipped to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Ukraine has been buying US coal at $206 per short ton, which is almost triple the $71 billed by US in 2016. Notably, Ukraine faced energy crisis after separatist-held railway blockade cut off the coal supply.
