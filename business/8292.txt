Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava in an interview said that self-driving cars won't work in India as “nobody obeys any of the driving rules”. He added, "How will you devise a technology that will predict customer behaviour? Nobody can predict customer behaviour". Bhargava. however, said that he'd love to see people put self-driving technology to use in Indian driving conditions.
