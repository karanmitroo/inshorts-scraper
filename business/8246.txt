Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that giving an opportunity to debt defaulters to defend themselves need not be carried to an “unnatural extent”. “It is not a usual judicial or quasi-judicial procedure when endless opportunities have to be granted," he stated. Notably, nearly 95,000 cases involving over ₹5 lakh crore are pending before debt recovery tribunals across India.
