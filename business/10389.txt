Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's cabinet on Tuesday approved fiscal stimulus worth around $277 billion, which is about 6% of their GDP. About $144 billion from the stimulus will be from public-private partnerships and not directly from the government. Abe said this could "stimulate demand" and "achieve sustainable economic growth led by private demand" for the stagnant Japanese economyâ€‹.
