In a major plan to restructure the company, Malaysian Airlines will lay off around one-third of its 20,000 staff on Wednesday to make itself more profitable, as reported on Monday. After restructuring, the airline will mainly operate within the country. Last year, one aircraft of the airline went missing with 239 people aboard and another, with 289 aboard, crashed.
