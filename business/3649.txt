Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran has said that there will "definitely" be pruning of the Tata portfolio. He said the company will not exit a business "just to get a headline", but only when it is certain it is not getting returns. He also said that the Nano car plant will not be shut down, despite its sales being less.
