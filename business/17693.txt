Subrata Roy will stay in Tihar jail for some more time as the Supreme Court on Thursday declined his plea for release on a personal bond with an assurance that he will not leave the country. Roy had offered to pay Rs.2,500 crore as part payment of the outstanding amount (Rs.20,000 crore), but the court refused to accept the offer.
