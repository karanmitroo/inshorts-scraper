UK supermarket Waitrose is recalling four varieties of its chocolate bars because they may be contaminated with pieces of plastic. The Food Standards Agency urged customers who have bought the 85 gram chocolate bars to not eat them. It has said any customer who bought one of the chocolate bars to return it to the store for a full refund.
