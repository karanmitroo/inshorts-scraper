The government is planning to amend the law to introduce stringent punishment for bounced cheques from 2017, reports stated. This would be a deterrent for defaulters in India, which is saddled with over 18 lakh lawsuits on dishonoured cheques. Under the proposed changes, the defaulter could be put in jail without bail at the courtâ€™s discretion.
