Kotak Mahindra's Uday Kotak has said BJP's win in the state polls is positive for economic reforms, and the government should focus on re-activating "animal spirits" of the private sector to invest. "[W]e just need to make sure that we are focused on growing the economy, getting the private sector's animal spirits back, and that will create jobs," Kotak said.
