India and Russia have agreed in principle to export BrahMos, the worldâ€™s fastest anti-ship cruise missile, to the UAE, Vietnam, South Africa and Chile. Discussions with other countries including Philippines, South Korea and Greece are also underway. The short-range supersonic missile can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft or land, and can fly as low as 10 metres above ground.
