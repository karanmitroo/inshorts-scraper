Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday expressed optimism over the export sector and said the demand is slowly picking up. Exports declined for the 17th straight month in April amid tepid global commodity demands. She added that exports are declining in value terms due to currency devaluation in several countries, and the unwillingness of African countries to pay in dollars.
