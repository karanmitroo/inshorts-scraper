Gold imports may increase to 75-90 tonnes/month as against about 40 tonnes in recent months after the RBI eased curbs to allow gold import on a 'consignment basis.' Banks can now act as intermediaries and not pay for the stock until a buyer has been found and trading houses will be allowed to bring in gold with no conditions attached.
