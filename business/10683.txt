Assocham on Saturday suggested against changing India's financial year from April-March, calling it "unnecessary" and an "avoidable disruption". According to the chamber, it will lead to systemic delays and cost India's trade and industry hundreds of crores of rupees. Moreover, the change will not align India with the world as different countries follow different financial years, it added.
