The decision to make service charge optional will affect around 85 lakh employees associated with the food service industry, National Restaurant Association President Riyaaz Amlani said. If such a statement is made "without application of mind" it will be detrimental to employees, he said. All workers associated with a restaurant, including the dishwasher, depend on service charge, he added.
