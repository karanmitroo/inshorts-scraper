The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) on Thursday launched a mobile app for GST to provide updates to taxpayers on the regime which is to be rolled out from July 1. The CBEC GST app will help taxpayers in migration to GST, provide reading material on GST, and also put draft laws and rules, among others.
