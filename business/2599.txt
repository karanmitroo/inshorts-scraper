The government on Tuesday said it has identified over 1.06 lakh directors of 'shell companies' for disqualification under the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. This is part of actions to break the network of shell companies and the fight against money laundering activities, it said. Notably, this follows cancellation of registration of nearly 2.1 lakh companies recently.
