Amazon Founder and the world's third-richest person, Jeff Bezos, has sold about $1 billion in company stock as part of a planned divestiture. This comes a month after Bezos said he would spend that amount annually on his space exploration startup Blue Origin. He still owns 7.9 crore Amazon shares, or about 17% of the e-commerce company.
