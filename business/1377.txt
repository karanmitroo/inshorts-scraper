While talking about entrepreneurship, MakeMyTrip's CEO Deep Kalra at a recent event said, "In India, it still takes a long time to build a business." Adding that people tend to panic too early, he said, "I tell entrepreneurs, don't look back for the first 4-5 years." Kalra further said that conviction is one of the most important things for him.
