HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver, due to present the company's annual report on Monday in the wake of an international controversy over its Geneva-based private bank, reportedly held about $7.6 million in a Swiss account through a Panamanian company. Although based in the UK, where HSBC has its headquarters, Gulliver is domiciled in Hong Kong for legal and tax purposes.
