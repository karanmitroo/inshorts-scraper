The London High Court has increased embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya's weekly living allowance from £5,000 (₹4.4 lakh) to £18,325 (₹16.3 lakh). The 266.5% increase comes as his global assets remain frozen. As many as 13 Indian banks had successfully obtained the freeze order against the global assets of Mallya, stating that he owes over ₹9,800 crore to the banks.
