The Supreme Court has stayed an order by the Karnataka High Court that reduced the mandatory pictorial warning on tobacco products from 85% to 40%. Emphasising the harmful effects of tobacco products, the apex court remarked that health of a citizen holds primacy. The stay came based on a petition filed by Health for Millions Trust, a non-government organisation.
