Multiplex chain PVR on Friday launched Vkaao, an on-demand platform, which will enable individuals to choose the movies they want to watch at their local theatre. Through Vkaao's web and app platform, users can select any movie from PVR's library and create a screening session. Once a necessary number of people commit to attending, the screening will get confirmed.
