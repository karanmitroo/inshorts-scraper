Nike, the world's largest athletic-gear company, said it would cut about 1,400 jobs and also reduce the number of sneaker and clothing styles it makes as part of a restructuring programme. It further said it plans to sell more shoes directly to customers online. With this, Nike said it'll be able to offer more products to customers faster.
