Former Infosys director Mohandas Pai has said the tightening of the US H-1B visa rules is a "blessing in disguise" for Indian IT firms. "I don't think they need to be scared or anything," he stated. The new regulations would play to Indian IT companies' strength because they have been reducing the number of H1-B visas since 2014, Pai added.
