RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said lower inflation and lower policy rates cannot exist simultaneously. "The fact that inflation is fairly close to the upper bound of our target zone today suggests we have not been overly hawkish", he added. He said this while addressing the criticism faced by the central bank for keeping high-interestâ€‹ rates during his tenure.
