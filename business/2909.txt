Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao, in a letter to Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha, said it is undesirable for the telecom industry to be regulated based on a new entrant's ambition. Colao said a move to reduce Mobile Termination Charge (MTC) risks destroying the very companies that built the industry. He also sought reduction in interest rate on deferred spectrum payment.
