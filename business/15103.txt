Twitter's Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategy, Rishi Garg, has resigned from the organisation. Garg led Twitterâ€™s Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) team and had reportedly joined the organisation in May 2014. This is the second resignation from the tech company's M&A team, after Jessica Verilli resigned last month as the director of the Corporate Development and Strategy.
