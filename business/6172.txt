Hyderabad-based GVK Power & Infrastructure, which runs the Mumbai and Bengaluru airports, on Monday won the bid to develop Mumbai's second airport in Navi Mumbai. GVK was competing only with GMR Infrastructure, which runs the Delhi and Hyderabad airports. The first phase of the 16,000-crore Navi Mumbai International Airport, first proposed in 1997, is expected to be operational by 2019.
