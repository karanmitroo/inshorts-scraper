The Economic Survey for 2015-16 for the first time dedicated a chapter to estimate the subsidies extended to the well-off. The survey estimated the total amount of subsidy going to the well-off to be about â‚¹1 lakh crore. The richer sections benefitted from tax incentives, PPF savings and subsidies on kerosene, LPG, electricity, railways, aviation turbine fuel, and gold.
