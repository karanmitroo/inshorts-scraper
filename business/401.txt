The Japanese economy posted its longest period of growth since the 1980s boom, government data showed on Wednesday. The world's third-largest economy expanded at an annualised rate of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, the eighth straight quarter of expansion.  The growth was mainly due to increased consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the country's GDP.
