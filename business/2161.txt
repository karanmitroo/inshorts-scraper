New York-based luxury fashion major Coach on Wednesday said it will change its corporate name to Tapestry, effective from October 31. Coach CEO Victor Luis said Coach's new corporate identity reflects its acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade. However, Coach bags, accessories, and stores will continue to carry the brand name.
