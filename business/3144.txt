Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said profit-making Air India subsidiaries should be kept out of proposed privatisation. Gadkari is part of the five-member ministerial panel, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, tasked with deciding on the process of privatising Air India. Earlier in June, the government gave in-principle approval for disinvestment of Air India and five of its units.
