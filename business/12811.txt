The RBI is expected to keep key interest rates unchanged in its bi-monthly policy review on Tuesday, Singapore-based DBS Bank suggested. "As markets stabilise, we expect RBI to keep the rates on hold. After 125 basis points rate cuts in 2015, the benchmark repo rate is likely to be held at 6.75% and reverse repo rate at 5.75%," it said.
