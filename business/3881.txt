Bharti Airtel has termed data breach as a "real threat" to businesses and said that the company takes its responsibility on data security and customer privacy "very seriously". The comments came after reports claimed that customer data, including mobile numbers and names of Reliance Jio users, were leaked on a website called 'magicapk'. Jio said it is investigating the claims.
