Idea Cellular has released ad films promoting its 4G network that take a jab at Reliance Jio's free data offers. One of the ads shows a man parking his car in a 'No Parking' zone and calling it 'free parking'. After the car is towed away, the ad ends with, "Free ki aadat mat daalo... Isiliye No FreeG, Idea 4G!"
