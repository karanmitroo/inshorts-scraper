Hackers have reportedly scammed customers of cryptocurrency startup BeeToken out of nearly $1 million worth of Ethereum in just a day. The hackers targeted BeeToken's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) but it's still unclear how hackers gained access to investors' email addresses. BeeToken confirmed the phishing attacks, warning users to remain wary of mails and Telegram messages asking users for funds.
