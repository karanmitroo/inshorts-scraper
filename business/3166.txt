Emilio Lozoya, former CEO of Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex, has denied reports that he received $10 million (â‚¹64 crore) bribe from Brazilian construction company, Odebrecht. A Brazilian newspaper earlier reported Odebrecht bribed Lozoya in exchange for being awarded a $115 million bid for works in an oil refinery. "These publications... have never proven their allegations," Lozoya said.
