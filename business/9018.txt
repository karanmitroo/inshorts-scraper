Shares of tech major Apple rose by 1% on Thursday after German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor posted a higher than expected quarterly revenue. Apple accounted for about 80% of Dialog's revenue last year, making the supplier's results a potential indicator of iPhone sales. This is a confirming data point of stronger iPhone 7 demand, analysts said.
