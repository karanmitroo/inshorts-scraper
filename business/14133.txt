Kerala High Court on Tuesday quashed a penalty of more than Rs 49 crore which was imposed on e-tailers Flipkart and Myntra by the stateâ€™s commercial tax department, accusing the companies of violating tax laws. The department had levied penalties on Flipkart, Myntra, Jabong and Robemall Apparels in January alleging they traded illegally in Kerala during 2012-14.
