The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked real estate developer Supertech to return money to homebuyers, saying it was not concerned whether the firm 'sinks or dies'. In 2014, the Allahabad High Court had ordered Supertech's two residential towers' demolition in Noida and asked it to refund the buyers' money. Meanwhile, Supertech had said the SC “cannot act like a banker”.
