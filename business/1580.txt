Diageo has sued liquor baron Vijay Mallya over a $40 million payment made when he was ousted from United Spirits last year. Diageo claimed Mallya breached an agreement under which he would step down as Chairman of United Spirits in exchange for $75 million. Diageo had paid an initial instalment of $40 million, which it wants back.
