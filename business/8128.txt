Egypt has secured $2 billion in financing from international banks, the country's central bank said. The funds were provided against "the entire amount of the newly issued Arab Republic of Egypt dollar-denominated sovereign bonds with different maturities". This comes a day before the IMF meets to consider Egypt's $12 billion loan request, which could ease dollar shortage in the country.
