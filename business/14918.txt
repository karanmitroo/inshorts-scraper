Budget carrier SpiceJet has launched a unique ticket purchase scheme, 'Book Now, Pay Later', under which passengers can pay through EMIs (equated monthly installments). Under the scheme, passengers holding credit cards issued by Axis, HSBC, Kotak, and Standard Chartered can pay through EMIs between 3 and 12 months. This scheme will make air travel more economically-viable, the carrier said.
