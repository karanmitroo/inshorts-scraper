The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is reportedly planning to seek an arrest warrant from international police organisation Interpol against beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya based on a non-bailable warrant issued against him by a special court. Mallya had left India on March 2 and is reported to be currently staying in the UK. Earlier, the government had suspended Mallya's diplomatic passport.
