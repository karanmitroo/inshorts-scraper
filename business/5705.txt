Alan Joyce, the CEO of Australiaâ€™s national carrier Qantas Airways, was criticised by a federal lawmaker for campaigning in favour of same-sex marriage. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said that Joyce shouldn't use an iconic brand and a multi-billion dollar business to campaign for such issues. Earlier, Joyce said marriage equality is good for the country and good for business.
