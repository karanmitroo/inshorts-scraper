U.K based bank Barclays posted a £174 million ($267.5mn) loss in its statutory full-year earnings on Tuesday as it set aside £1.25bn in anticipation of fines and penalties for allegedly rigging foreign exchange markets. The adjusted pre-tax profit discounting one-off costs, increased by 12% in 2014 to £5.5 billion ($8.46 billion) compared to the year before, beating analysts' expectations.
