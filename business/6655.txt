State-run carrier Air India has temporarily taken off 57 crew members from flying for being "overweight" and put them on ground duty. These crew members, including air hostesses, have been told to "shape up" within a stipulated time frame, failing which they would be grounded permanently, reports said. Notably, in 2015, Air India grounded 125 crew members for being overweight.
