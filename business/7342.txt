Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry on Tuesday said that he is fighting to save the soul of the Tata Group. This comes ahead of TCS' meeting to decide Mistry's removal as a director. "Whatever be the decibel level of the voice that would drown your vote, I call on you to vote with your conscience," Mistry wrote to shareholders.
