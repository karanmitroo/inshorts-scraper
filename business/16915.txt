Flipkart's initiative in partnership with the central government - 'Flipkart Kaarigar ka Dwaar' - will start in Varanasi in two weeks, with 50 of the city's 40k weavers. The company will set up a cluster or collection centre in the city, where the weavers will interact with the designers and also where they will deposit their products.
