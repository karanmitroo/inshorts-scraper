Food processing major Nestlé on Thursday said it is in the process of destroying 38,550 tonnes (approximately 54 crore packets) of its "two-minute" Maggi noodles. These were recalled after India's food regulator FSSAI banned Maggi, alleging it was unfit for consumption due to the presence of lead and MSG beyond permissible limits. The recalled goods are worth ₹420 crore.
