The Commerce Ministry in its Budget recommendations has reportedly suggested against invoking the sunset clause, meaning a gradual abolition of the tax incentives to the Special Economic Zones (SEZs). The ministry said it would "hurt (the) exports and employment generation" from the SEZs. The government is considering gradually doing away with the tax exemptions enjoyed by the export zones.
