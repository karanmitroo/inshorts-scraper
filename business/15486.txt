Google has apologised for an image of Android mascot urinating on an Apple logo at a Pakistani location on Google Maps. The search giant said that work was started to step up verification of user edits on its Map Maker platform. Earlier this month, the map of Washingtonâ€™s White House was revised to include a business called "Edwards Snow Den".
