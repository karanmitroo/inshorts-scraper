A Pakistan International Airlines' pilot, on a flight to Beijing, forced out his crew members from the cockpit to spend time with a Chinese female passenger there. The woman reportedly stayed inside the cockpit for over two hours, coming out only after the plane landed. According to the rules, nobody except the crew can be allowed to enter the cockpit.
