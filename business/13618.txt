Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday said that near zero interest rate of 0-0.25% was needed to boost the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. She added that the interest rates were a reflection of Fed's stance and also of the economic weakness the US witnessed. Yellen further said that the interest rate will be increased gradually.
