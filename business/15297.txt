Air India (AI) has suspended 17 air hostesses for allegedly delaying flights on multiple occasions. The airline had earlier this year faced a sharp decline in its on-time performance (OTP) due to reasons like shortage of cabin crew and indiscipline of reporting to airports late for flights. AI has so far sacked 272 crew members for indiscipline.
