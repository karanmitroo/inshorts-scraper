After presenting the 2018 Budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said that he has been putting surplus money in the hands of the middle-class taxpayer step by step, in every budget. He added that the Budget had addressed criticism that elected members fix their own salaries by proposing an institutional mechanism to fix their emoluments.
