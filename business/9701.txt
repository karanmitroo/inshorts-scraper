State Bank of India raised â‚¹2,100 crore through perpetual bonds at 9% interest on Tuesday from private lender Yes Bank, according to reports. Issuers pay interest forever on perpetual bonds, which do not have a maturity date but are redeemable after a pre-agreed 'call date'. Notably, perpetual bonds can be treated as equity, instead of debt.
