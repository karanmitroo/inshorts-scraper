Air India plans to vacate unused hangar space at some airports and sell the scrap lying there to cut costs, CMD Rajiv Bansal said. The airline is also looking to cut some costs by rationalising some routes, including in the Gulf region. This comes as Air India has a â‚¹50,000-crore debt and the government is considering disinvestment of the airline.
