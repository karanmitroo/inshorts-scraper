The UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday named India among the countries which are keen on a free trade agreement (FTA) with the UK post-Brexit. Other countries like Canada, China, and Singapore said they would "welcome" talks on future FTAs, she added. In June, the UK voted to leave the European Union through which it negotiated trade deals.
