The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought responses from the Finance Ministry and the RBI on a plea against "illegal" surcharges levied on credit and debit card transactions, when no such charge is imposed on cash payments. Responses were sought by August 19 on the plea which also asked for directions to frame guidelines for preventing levy of such charges.
