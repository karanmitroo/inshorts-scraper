The US Air Force on Wednesday awarded Elon Musk-owned space company SpaceX its first military contract of launching a GPS satellite for $83 million. This has broken the monopoly that aerospace firms Lockheed Martin and Boeing have held on military space launches for over a decade. The satellite will be launched in May 2018 from Florida, Air Force officials said.
