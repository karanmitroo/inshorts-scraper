Several stores owned by Swedish retailer H&M in South Africa were trashed by members of anti-racism group Economic Freedom Fighters over an advertisement they viewed as racist. The advertisement, which showed a black child in a hooded top which had "coolest monkey in the jungle" written on it, faced global backlash. The organisation praised its members for "physically confronting racism".
