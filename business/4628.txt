Thousands took to the streets in Chicago, US, calling McDonald's the "Donald Trump of corporations" while protesting low wages and sexual harassment at the fast-food giant ahead of its annual shareholder meeting. The demonstrators were part of a nationwide protest organised by labour group "Fight for 15". "McDonald's just like Donald Trump steals wages from its workers," the group said.
