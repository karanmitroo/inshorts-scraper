The unions representing employees of government banks have threatened to launch a strike if overtime dues are not cleared for working long hours to handle the demonetisation rush. The unions have claimed that no bank has cleared the dues in full, and also threatened legal action. The issue was also brought to the attention of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
