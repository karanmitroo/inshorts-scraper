The Finance Ministry on Tuesday constituted two new panels – the Tax Policy Research Unit (TPRU) and Tax Policy Council (TPC) – to ensure coherence in the framing of tax policies. The changes are in accordance with the recommendations of the Tax Administration Reform Commission (TARC) to enable independent, multidisciplinary analysis of proposals before a decision is taken.
