Investors who stuck with Greek securities through the economic turmoil of the new government and the ensuing debt and bailout negotiations earned a world-beating return of 11 percent this year. This is more than more than double the 4.2 percent profit on second ranking Danish securities, while treasuries earned 1.2 percent in the same period.
