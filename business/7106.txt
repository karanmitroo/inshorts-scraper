Tata Sons has demanded ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry to return all confidential information and documents about the firm in his possession. Tata lawyers further demanded that Mistry sign a letter pledging not to disclose any such information. The notice comes after Tata Sons on Tuesday accused Mistry of breaching confidentiality rules, and said it would take legal action against him.
