The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for higher allowances, including house rent allowance (HRA). The move will benefit more than 50 lakh serving and retired central government employees. Notably, the Cabinet decision comes more than a year after the pay of central government employees was increased.
