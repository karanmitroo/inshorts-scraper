Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday launched the country's first international arbitration centre in Mumbai. Businesses coming to Mumbai will not need to go to Singapore, Hong Kong or London for arbitration now, Fadnavis said. Further, he affirmed that the Mumbai centre would be able to attract arbitration cases not only from Indian companies but also from global firms.
