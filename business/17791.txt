Bitcoin ATM manufacturer, Robocoin, has announced that later this month it will install the first ATMs in the United States that let users buy and sell bitcoin. The ATMs will allow people to swap bitcoin for cash, or deposit cash to buy more bitcoin by transferring funds to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphones.
