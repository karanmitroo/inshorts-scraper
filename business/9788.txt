The 10 trade unions that are on a nationwide strike against the Centre’s alleged ‘anti-labour’ policies have a 12-point charter of demands. These include ensuring minimum wage of ₹18,000 per month, a minimum monthly pension of ₹3,000, and controlling price rise. Further, they have demanded no FDI in railways, defence and insurance, and universal social security for all workers.
