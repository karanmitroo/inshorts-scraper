Sportswear giant Nike has fired 20% of its Indian workforce, and has asked many others to join its operations in Southeast Asia, according to reports. The layoffs come as part of its global restructuring process, reports added. Earlier, Nike pulled out of cricket bat sponsorship deals and closed around 35% of its stores in India as a cost-cutting measure.
