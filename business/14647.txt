Credit rating agency Moody's on Friday cut its forecast for global economic growth to 2.8% from the 3% percent it had predicted just 10 days ago for the world's top 20 economies. The agency trimmed China, US, Japan and South Korea's growth forecasts and predicted Russia and Brazil to stay in recession, based on new information made available recently.
