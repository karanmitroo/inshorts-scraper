Taiwanese smartphone-maker HTC has announced that it will make "significant" job cuts across the board and discontinue models to focus on its high-end devices. The move follows tough market competition where HTC has reported a loss in the second quarter and has predicted one for the third quarter as well. The company's shares have fallen 51% so far this year.
