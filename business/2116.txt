Former UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani has said that India is on a "very good wicket on privacy". He said they are "very confident" that government's Aadhaar card scheme will successfully pass the test of privacy. Previously, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that Aadhaar card scheme, which has enrolled more than 1 billion people, will "stand the test of constitutionality".
