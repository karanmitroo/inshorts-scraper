The Centre and the Bihar government have signed a $290 million credit agreement with the World Bank under the state's rural development project 'JEEViKA-II'. The project covers 300 new blocks in 32 districts not covered by earlier schemes, World Bank said. It will organise rural poor into self-help groups, enabling them to access markets and financial services, the lender added.
