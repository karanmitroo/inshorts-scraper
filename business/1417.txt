Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Bitcoin doesn't feel like a currency as it moves up and down 20% in a day. Blankfein said he doesn't consider Bitcoin a store of value. He said there is no urgency for the bank to develop a Bitcoin strategy, adding, "Life must be really, really rosy if this is what we're talking about."
