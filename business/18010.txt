Former iGate CEO Phaneesh Murthy, who was fired from the company in May, has filed a defamation and breach of contract case against his former employer. The lawsuit mentioned that there have been a number of similar consensual relationships in iGate, but the company had not acted on any, barring Murthy's. Murthy was fired for not reporting a consensual relationship.
