Search engine Yahoo's early investment of $25 million in photo messaging app Snapchat in 2014 has nearly quadrupled to $97.6 million, according to company filings. When Yahoo first bought its stake in Snapchat, it had used a portion of the cash earned from an earlier investment in Alibaba. Snapchat was founded in 2011 by a group of Stanford University students.
