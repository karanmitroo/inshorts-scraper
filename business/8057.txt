US President Barack Obama's government has suspended its efforts to win congressional approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact, saying its fate was up to President-elect Donald Trump. The TPP pact aims for more free trade between countries along the Pacific Rim through lowering of both non-tariff and tariff barriers to trade. Notably, Trump claims that TPP is a "disaster".
