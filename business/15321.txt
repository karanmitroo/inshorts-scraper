Amazon is introducing Amazon Handmade, a marketplace for handmade goods, aimed directly at competing with Etsy, an e-commerce website for handmade and vintage products. Amazon is allegedly sending emails to Etsy's sellers stating that "We're offering artisans like you a first peek at Handmade, a new marketplace for handcrafted goods". The news came just days after Etsy shares tanked 24%.
