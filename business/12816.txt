Amid low demand and technical troubles, automaker Volkswagen will stop production for a few days at its plants in Germany's Kassel and Emden. The Kassel plant, which makes gearboxes and body part for cars, was shut on Friday and affected 400 workers. The output from Emden plant, which stamps parts and assembles cars, fell due to technical issues.
