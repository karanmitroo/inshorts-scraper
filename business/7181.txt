Over half a dozen bullion traders and jewellers in Bengaluru have undisclosed income worth over â‚¹47 crore, the I-T department said on Friday. The surge in gold sales post demonetisation had prompted the department to conduct surveys, based on which the amount was detected. Investigations found that city-based jewellers had recorded higher sales compared to the same period last year.
