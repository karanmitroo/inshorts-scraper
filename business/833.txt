Yoga guru-turned-businessman Ramdev on Tuesday said Patanjali has no plans to enter into partnerships with any international company. He also said that Patanjali would welcome financial support if offered but doesn't support the idea of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Notably, a private equity fund co-owned by Louis Vuitton maker LVMH had said it's ready to invest $500 million in Patanjali.
