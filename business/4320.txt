A Starbucks customer in the US has claimed that she was mocked by employees for wearing a T-shirt with an image of US President Donald Trump. She claims that the cashier who took her order laughed at her and her drink was labelled, "Build a Wall," in reference to Trump's campaign promise of building a wall across the US-Mexico border.
