TRAI has issued new guidelines to curb call drops along with penalty of up to ₹10 lakh. Penalty will range from ₹1-5 lakh depending on deviation from benchmarks in a quarter. Penalty will increase 1.5 times if telcos fail to meet call drop benchmark for the consecutive quarter, whereas it'll be doubled if benchmarks are violated for over two quarters.
