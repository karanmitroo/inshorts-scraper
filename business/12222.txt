The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed a bill to amend the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act (MMDR Act) to allow the transfer of captive mining leases that are not granted through auction. The move will enable banks and financial institutions to sell stressed assets, where a company or its captive mining lease is mortgaged, to recover debts.
