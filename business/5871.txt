American venture investor Chris Sacca has shared an email from Snapchat Co-founder Bobby Murphy from 2012 which he did not respond to. "I know one person who isn't getting rich in the Snapchat IPO. Hint: the guy who didn't reply to this email," Sacca posted. The investor further congratulated the social media company for its IPO.
