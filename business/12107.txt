UK news organisation The Independent on Saturday published its last print edition after its launch in 1986, to shift completely to the digital-only format. The Independent's last print editorial said, "[H]istory will judge (the transition) as an example for other newspapers around the world to follow". The final edition also carried four magazines that look back at the newspaper's history.
