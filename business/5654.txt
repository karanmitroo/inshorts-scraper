American Express, the biggest credit-card issuer by customer spending, paid its CEO Ken Chenault $22 million (nearly ₹144 crore) for his work in 2016, a 19% increase. His compensation puts him on par with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Notably, AmEx, which counts Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as its biggest shareholder, climbed 6.5% in 2016 after tumbling 25% previous year.
