The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to consider a PIL that called for scrapping the government's plan to end the use of ₹500, ₹1,000 notes and scheduled a hearing for Tuesday. The government asked the court to not pass an interim order without hearing its argument. A Delhi-based lawyer filed the PIL against the "Tughlaki Farman", seeking more time.
