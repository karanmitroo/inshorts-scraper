Domestic rating agency ICRA said that with public sector banks recognising large non-performing assets (NPA) following RBIs asset-quality review, gross NPA level is likely to increase to ₹4.8-5.3 lakh crore or 6.2-6.8% as of March 31. The profitability of banks could therefore remain low in FY17, it added. PSBs reported net losses of ₹11,400 crore in the December quarter.
