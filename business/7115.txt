World's fifth largest advertising agency Dentsu's CEO Tadashi Ishii has quit a year after a 24-year-old employee committed suicide blaming overwork. Ishii said he was stepping down to "take responsibility for failing to fix the companyâ€™s notoriously punishing culture of overtime work."  He added, "Despite having taken various measures, we haven't achieved a dramatic reform of overwork."
