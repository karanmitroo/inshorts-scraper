India's third-largest smartphone maker, Karbonn Mobiles, is expected to go public by 2016. "Frankly, I've been delaying it for the last couple of years because I wanted to know my valuation...and now my valuation has gone much higher in the last few years," company chairman Sudhir Hasija said. The company expects revenue to grow to $1.32 billion by Mar-2015.
