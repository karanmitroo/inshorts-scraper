Indiaâ€™s gold imports declined by around 59% year-on-year to 270 tonnes between January to September, a report by industry body Assocham stated on Tuesday. Gold imports declined due to a prolonged strike by jewellers, among others, it added. Notably, India is the world's second biggest gold consumer with average imports of over 1,000 tonnes annually.
