Iceland is expected to use more electricity mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin than it uses to power its homes, according to energy company HS Orka. The company added that if all future crypto mining projects are realised, the island nation won't have enough energy for it. Notably, large mining companies have come to Iceland due to its abundance of renewable energy.
