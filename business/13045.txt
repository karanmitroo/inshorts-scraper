Gold prices surged by ₹340 to hit an over two-month high of ₹26,550 per ten grams at the bullion market on Saturday. The upside in gold prices was supported by positive global cues, a wedding season-triggered jewellery demand hike and a weaker rupee, which plunged to a fresh 28-month low of 67.59 against the dollar yesterday, thereby making imports costlier.
