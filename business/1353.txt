Europe's biggest toymaker Lego on Thursday said it won its first copyright court case against imitators in China. A Chinese court has ruled that products under the name 'Bela', sold by two Chinese companies, infringed upon Lego's copyrights. In July, a court passed a ruling that recognized the Lego logo and the name in Chinese as 'well-known' trademarks in China.
