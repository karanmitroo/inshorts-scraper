India, with 12 probes launched, was the second leading initiator of anti-dumping investigations in 2015, according to global body World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO members are allowed to launch such investigations on imports when the exporting company ships a product at a price lower than that charged in its home market. The US topped the list with 15 investigations.
