British car maker Rolls-Royce launched its new super-luxury open-top car, Dawn, on Tuesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Unveiled by CEO Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, the model revives a name first used in 1949 by the company. The car is expected to come to India by 2016 as Rolls-Royce plans to tap the countryâ€™s billionaires with new models.
