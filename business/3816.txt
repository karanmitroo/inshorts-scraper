Police have recovered 50 SIM cards from a 35-year-old computer science dropout from Rajasthan, who was arrested in the case of Reliance Jio's alleged consumer data leak. Police earlier recovered a computer, mobile phone and other devices from him. Notably, the systems breach had put 'sensitive details' of Jio customers, including names and email IDs, online.
