Yes Bank on Friday signed a pact with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) under which it would list green bonds worth up to $500 million, as part of its $1 billion capital raising plans. Green bonds, short-hand for Qualified Green Building and Sustainable Design Project Bonds, are tax-exempted bonds created for funding projects having environmental benefits.
