China, the largest holder of US government debt, is reportedly dumping US Treasuries at an accelerated rate in an attempt to support the yuan. Following the surprise devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago, the People's Bank of China has been selling dollars and buying yuan to support the yuan's exchange rate. China controls $1.48 trillion of US government debt.
