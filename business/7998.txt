The government has announced deploying micro-ATMs to ease the cash crunch in the country. Micro-ATMs are small portable devices, easy to hold in hand, allowing individuals to deposit or withdraw funds regardless of the bank in which their account is. The move is aimed at addressing the problem in rural and semi-urban areas, where the ATM network is not strong.
