Greece's Lambrakis Press Group (DOL) on Saturday said that two of its newspapers including Ta Nea, the country's best-selling daily, will cease publication due to financial reasons. DOL added that the situation was a result of the economic crisis Greece is currently facing. This comes after DOL failed to pay its €99m (₹721 crore) debt obligations in December.
