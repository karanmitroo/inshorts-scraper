US-based coffee company Bestherbs Coffee is recalling one of its coffee products, which was found to contain a substance similar to an active ingredient in Viagra drug, used to cure erectile dysfunction. The ingredient is not listed on the product bag. US authorities further revealed the product contained undeclared milk, which could be a potential risk to lactose intolerant people.
