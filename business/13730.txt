In order to clarify taxation and foreign investment issues in the e-commerce sector, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the government will "at least come out with some definition of what e-commerce is." The ministry is currently mulling over inputs from states on e-commerce segment issues. Current rules allow for 100% FDI only in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce.
