Gold prices surged for the sixth straight day on Friday to increase to an over five-month high of ₹27,670 and ₹27,520 per ten grams for gold of 99.9% and 99.5% purity respectively. The rise was supported by positive global cues, wedding season-triggered jewellery demand, and the US dollar’s extended losses amid fading expectations of a US rate hike this year.
