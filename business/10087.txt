The State Bank of India used to print currency in 1861 when it had been the Presidency banks in Bengal, Bombay, and Madras. However, the Presidency banks stopped printing currency in 1867 and later merged to become 'Imperial Bank of India' and then the SBI. Recently, SBI merged with its associate banks in the first large-scale consolidation among India's banks.
