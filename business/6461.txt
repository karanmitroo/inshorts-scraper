The tradition of carrying a Budget briefcase can be traced back to the British, who carried a 'Budget box' on every Budget Day since 1860. The practice reportedly started when Britain's budget chief was asked to 'open the budget' while presenting the statement. The practice was introduced in independent India by the first Finance Minister RK Shanmukham Chetty in 1947.
