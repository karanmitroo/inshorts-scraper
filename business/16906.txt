The Haryana government has stopped the construction of the Rs 3,500-crore-plus R&D project of Maruti suzuki at Rohtak, as it does not have the required environmental clearance. The project, that was to develop and test cars for India and the world, is the first such unit being set up outside Japan by the local auto maker's parent, Suzuki Motor.
