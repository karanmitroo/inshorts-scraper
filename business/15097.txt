China’s Central Bank reportedly cut its benchmark lending rates on Saturday, for the fourth time since November, by 25 basis points to 4.85%. The People's Bank of China also reduced one-year benchmark deposit rates by 25 basis points to 2%. These reductions, that will take effect on Sunday, were measures to lower borrowing costs and support the country’s slowing economy.
