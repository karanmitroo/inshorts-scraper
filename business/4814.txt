The Trump Taj Mahal, the Atlantic City casino, which the now US President Donald Trump built for $1.2 billion (over ₹7,700 crore) in 1990, was sold for only $50 million (₹322 crore). Trump had dubbed the Taj Mahal as "the eighth wonder of the world". Hard Rock, which bought the shuttered casino in March, plans to reopen it in 2018.
