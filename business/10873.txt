The Coal Ministry has issued a show causeâ€‹ notice to Reliance Power asking reasons for the "delay" in developing coal mines associated with the proposed Tilaiya power project in Jharkhand. The firm had, in May 2015, terminated the contract it was awarded in 2007 by the government citing a failure of the project's procurers in fulfilling obligations including land allocation.
