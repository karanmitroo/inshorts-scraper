Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has entered into licensing agreements with yoga guru Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurveda Limited to manufacture and market herbal supplements and food products developed by it. The move will enable DRDO products, which are developed by its laboratory Defence Institute of High Altitude Research, to expand their consumer base beyond the armed forces.
