A total of 43 McDonald's outlets in Delhi operated without valid health licenses for nearly three months from April 1, estranged India partner Vikram Bakshi alleged. Bakshi, an equal joint venture partner of McDonald's India in Connaught Plaza Restaurants, refused to sign licensing documents. Notably, McDonald's shut 43 of the 55 Delhi outlets over failure to renew eating house licences.
