Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay $38 million to settle a US litigation over allegations that it conspired with other banks to fix silver prices at the investors' expense, according to court papers filed on Monday. The alleged conspiracy started by 1999 and suppressed prices on roughly $30 billion of silver and silver financial instruments traded each year, investors said.
