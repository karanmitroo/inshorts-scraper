Kobe Steel, Japanâ€™s third-largest steelmaker, has said its staff falsified data about the strength and durability of some aluminium and copper products used in planes, trains and potentially a space rocket. The company said products used by about 200 companies were certified with falsified data. The companies included Toyota, Mazda, Subaru and Central Japan Railway among others.
