Greek legislators on Sunday passed a bill to increase taxes, set up a new privatisation fund and free up the sale of banks' bad loans, among other initiatives. The measures are reportedly expected to help Greece unlock fresh funds it needs to repay IMF loans and bonds of the European Central Bank maturing in July and curtail rising state deficit.
