A Japanese IT firm Ferray has a total of nine cats that eat, sleep, and walk freely in the office, for stressed out employees. Hidenobu Fukuda, who heads the firm, introduced an “office cat” policy in 2000 upon request from one of his employees. "I also give 5,000 yen (₹2,900) a month to those who rescue a cat,” he added.
