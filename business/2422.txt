The Aditya Birla Group is set to shut down its flagship e-commerce site Abof.com, the company announced on Thursday. The company's HR director said 240 Abof employees will be given four and-a-half months' salary as compensation, in case they choose to quit. He added, "Looking at how... long term e-commerce businesses continue to struggle... it didn't seem logical to continue".
