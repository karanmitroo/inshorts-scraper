A woman in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut has claimed that about ₹100 crore was deposited in her Jan Dhan Yojana bank account. The woman’s husband Ziledar Singh said they were shocked as his wife draws a monthly salary of only ₹5,000. They have sought PMO's intervention in the matter as the bank officials allegedly did not attend to their complaint.
