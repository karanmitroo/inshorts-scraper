The BSE Sensex on Friday fell by 300.65 points to 25,489.57, while the NSE Nifty dropped 85.50 points to 7,814.90, after industrial production in March plunged to 0.1% and retail inflation jumped to 5.39% in April. A weak trend on other Asian bourses, tracking overnight losses in the US and European markets, also weighed on the trading sentiment, analysts said.
