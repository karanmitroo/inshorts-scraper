Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has launched 'Aaykar Setu', a new taxpayer app, which aims to provide better taxpayer services by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. The app will help users understand direct taxes, pay taxes, apply for PAN, and even share grievances with the right authorities. It will also let users link their Aadhaar number with PAN.
