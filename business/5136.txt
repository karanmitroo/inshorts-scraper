American Airlines pilots have complained their new uniforms were giving them rashes, swollen eyes, and making them feel generally ill. "If the uniform is making them not fit for duty, then something has to change," a pilot association said. The airline has declined to recall the clothing despite 3,000 flight attendants and about 5,000 total employees complaining of similar symptoms.
