Australia's biggest bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, was on Tuesday hit with a class-action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders over a money laundering scandal. Litigation financier IMF Bentham said it would fund the lawsuit. It accused the bank of making false and misleading statements, and failing to disclose breaches of anti-money laundering rules for years.
