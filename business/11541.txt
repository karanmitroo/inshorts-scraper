British automotive brand Jaguar Land Rover, currently owned by Tata Motors, has tied up with UK-based consumer electronics firm Bullitt Group to develop mobile devices and a range of accessories under its brand. The phones are expected to be launched by early 2017. Bullitt had earlier formed similar partnerships with machinery construction firms Caterpillar and JCB to launch their smartphones.
