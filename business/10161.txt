In order to get more people to join the National Pension System, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority has lowered the minimum annual contribution by a subscriber for his account to ₹1,000. Earlier, subscribers had to contribute at least ₹6,000. Further, as a one-time measure, PFRDA will unfreeze the existing accounts of subscribers who failed to maintain minimum requirements.
