The red star logo of beer giant Heineken could be banned in Hungary under a government proposal to prohibit the commercial use of “totalitarian” symbols. The proposal aims to outlaw merchandise featuring symbols like the Nazi swastika or the communist red star. Anyone in breach of the proposed law could face $7 million (₹46 crore) fine, and two years’ jail.
