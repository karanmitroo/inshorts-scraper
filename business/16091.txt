Malaysian low-cost airline AirAsia has scrapped fuel surcharges on tickets following the decline in global oil prices. AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes said the move will help reduce travel costs, stimulate demand and boost tourism in the region. Fernandes further added that fuel surcharges were also scrapped for flights under its long-haul arm AirAsia X.
