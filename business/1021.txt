India's largest lender SBI is planning to bring down the minimum balance limit for savings accounts to ₹1,000 from the current ₹3,000 balance in metros, according to reports. This comes after a Finance Ministry report showed that SBI collected ₹1,771 crore during April-November 2017 as charges from customers who didn't maintain their minimum monthly average balance in their accounts.
