Biotechnology firm Monsanto on Thursday said it has withdrawn an application seeking approval for its next generation of genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds in India. The firm owed its decision to the "uncertainty" in the country's regulatory environment. However, Monsanto said it is committed to Indian agriculture and plans to continue bringing its innovative research in the country.
