South Korean steelmaker Posco on Friday informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that it would not be able to set up its $12 billion steel plant in Odisha by July 2017, as the construction is yet to begin. The company has not been able to obtain forest and other clearances for the project, billed as Indiaâ€™s biggest foreign direct investment.
