The Kerala High Court on Friday put a stay on the National Green Tribunal’s May 23 order to ban diesel vehicles older than 10 years from plying in six cities of the state, including Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. The NGT order was reportedly expected to force an estimated 2 lakh vehicles out of roads, besides costing the state exchequer more than ₹500 crore.
