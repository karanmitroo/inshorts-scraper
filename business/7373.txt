Tata independent director Nusli Wadia has said, “The reasons for which I am being sought to be removed as director is my independence of mind and action”. “I do not serve the Tata group in any capacity and I am not required to act in their interest," he added. Wadia further said principal allegations against him are "unsubstantiated" and "baseless".
