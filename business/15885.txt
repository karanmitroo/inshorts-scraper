Asking the government to make defence business easier, Reliance ADA Group chairman Anil Ambani said that the three Cs — CBI, CVC and CAG — were slowing down decision-making process and creating hurdles in doing business in the defence sector. Replying to Ambani's comments, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said that the three Cs could be neutralised by checking corruption.
