McDonald's workers at two restaurants in England have voted in favour of a strike, which would be the first industrial action by staff of the US fast-food giant in UK. The strike comes amid concerns over working conditions and use of zero-hour contracts. Employees are demanding a wage of at least £10 (₹821) an hour and more secure working hours.
