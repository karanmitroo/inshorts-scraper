PNB has denied reports that cricketer Virat Kohli will discontinue endorsing the bank, terming the claims as "totalling false and incorrect". This comes after reports claimed that Kohli might terminate his contract with PNB over the $1.77-billion fraud case against jeweller Nirav Modi. PNB also said that it hasn't engaged audit firm PwC to conduct an investigation in the case.
