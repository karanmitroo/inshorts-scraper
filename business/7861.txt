The Finance Ministry on Friday said artisans, workers and housewives, earlier exempted from questioning for depositing up to â‚¹2.5 lakh, may be prosecuted if they're found to have helped in turning black money into white. This came after the Ministry said it received reports of people depositing black money belonging to others in their accounts for a reward in return.
