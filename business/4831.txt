US-based IT major Cognizant is looking to lay off 6,000 employees in India to increase hiring in its home country, according to reports. This comes after President Donald Trump's administration expressed displeasure over US firms outsourcing jobs to other countries. Meanwhile, it has also been reported that Cognizant may let go of some senior employees through a voluntary retirement scheme.
