Over â‚¹36,000 crore were saved in the last two years from providing various payments and wages to beneficiaries under the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, Mission Director GS Shekhawat said. He added that 84 schemes including the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana have been included under DBT. More government money would be saved if more schemes are brought under DBT, he added.
