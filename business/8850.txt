Domestic carrier Vistara on Thursday said it has secured a certification from aviation regulator DGCA, allowing its aircraft to operate even in conditions when visibility is less than 50 metres. The certification will enable Vistara to operate in foggy or poor weather conditions, anticipated in northeastern and northern India during the winters, the airline stated.
