E-commerce major Snapdeal is in talks with online order management and fulfillment platform start-up, Unicommerce to acquire the latter at up to $10 million, sources said.
If the deal goes through, it will be Snapdeal's sixth and biggest acquisition since its inception. Unicommerce was founded in 2012 by three classmates from IIT Delhi--Ankit Pruthi, Karun Singla and Vibhu Garg.
