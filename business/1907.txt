Shares of US telecom company Sprint fell about 9% on Monday on reports that its parent SoftBank called off merger talks with T-Mobile. T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom reportedly requested to have control over the combined company but SoftBank decided to not give up control. If the talks fall apart, this would be the second time their attempted merger has failed.
