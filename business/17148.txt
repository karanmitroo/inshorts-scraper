The RBI has relaxed norms governing import of rough, cut and polished diamonds by doubling the credit time period to 180 days. Earlier, the time frame was of 90 days. The RBI said the revised directions will come into force with immediate effect. The decision was taken after consideration of the representations received from the diamond importers and GJEPC.
