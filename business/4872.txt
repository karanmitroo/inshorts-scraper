The newly enacted Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act sets up a realty regulator, and the apartments' prices will now be based only on carpet area. The prices will exclude super built-up area, which includes common spaces. Further, builders have to set aside 70% funds collected from buyers for a project, which can be used for only that construction site.
