Rajat Gupta, India-born former director of Goldman Sachs Group, convicted in 2012 for insider trading, has agreed to surrender to prison authorities on Jun-17 to begin a two-year sentence in Otisville, New York. Gupta is the highest profile executive convicted since Manhattan's Indian-American US attorney Preet Bharara began a crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds in 2007.
