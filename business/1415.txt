US prosecutors have asked a federal court to force "pharma bro" Martin Shkreli to give up $7.4 million in assets, including his one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album worth $2 million. Prosecutors have also sought to seize a Lil Wayne album, and an Enigma machine. The former Turing Pharmaceutical CEO and hedge fund manager was convicted in August of defrauding investors.
