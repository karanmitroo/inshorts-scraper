Indian software major Infosys' CEO Vishal Sikka has said that Donald Trump's win in the US presidential elections might impact the company's margins in the near-term. Trump's anti-immigrant policies would likely make hiring people in the United States more expensive, he added. However, Sikka said Infosys does not expect to lose market share to US rivals like Cognizant.
