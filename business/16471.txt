Under an exclusive tie-up between publisher Rupa and e-commerce giant Amazon, President Pranab Mukherjee's book 'The Dramatic Decade: The Indira Gandhi Years' will be available only on Amazon's website for the first 21 days after its launch on Dec 11. This has sparked a war between bookstores and Amazon. Several upset offline bookstores are also considering boycotting Rupa publishers.
