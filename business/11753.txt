Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have pumped in ₹12,970 crore (around $1.95 billion) into India's capital markets in April (till Friday). Investments in equity markets stood at ₹6,734 crore while ₹6,236 crore was invested in debt markets. Recent rate cut by the RBI, which forecasts of an above average monsoon this year, and positive macroeconomic data helped the inflow, analysts said.
