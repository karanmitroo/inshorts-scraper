Dish Network has to pay $280 million (â‚¹1,800 crore) to US government and four states for using robocalls on consumers on do-not-call lists, marking a record fine for telemarketing violations. Dish was sued in 2009 for violating two consumer telemarketing laws by making over 5.5 crore illegal calls. Dish, however, blamed contractors and subcontractors for 90% of the bad calls.
