National Australia Bank has written to 60,000 customers to notify them it sent their account details to an incorrect e-mail address. This included information like names, e-mail addresses, and account numbers but didn't include any passwords, the bank stated. “The error was caused by human error...and as soon as we realised what had happened we took action,” it added.
