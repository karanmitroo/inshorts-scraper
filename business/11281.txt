Capital market regulator Sebi is planning to delist over 4,000 listed companies whose shares arenâ€™t actively traded, chairman UK Sinha said. The clean up includes 1,200 companies whose shares have been suspended from trading on the BSE and NSE for the past seven years. The 3,000 companies listed on the defunct regional bourses would also face the axe, he added.
