Air carrier Jet Airways on Friday launched a first-of-its-kind feature 'Fare lock' that allows users the flexibility to lock the fare for a ticket. Users can then buy the ticket at the locked price within the next 72 hours. To avail the feature, users need to pay a fee of ₹350 for domestic flights and ₹700 for international flights.
