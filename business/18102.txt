The central government has made it mandatory for a salaried taxpayer, who wishes to seek house rent allowance (HRA), to submit the landlord's PAN details if he/she pays a rent of over Rs 8,333 per month. The new rule effectively lowers the rent limit from Rs 15,000 a month to Rs 8,333 per month for claiming exemption under HRA.
