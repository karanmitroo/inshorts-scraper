Ankur Jain, Founder of B9 Beverages that sells the Bira 91 beer, has said the company is at the same place where Nike was in 1977. "Like they have redefined the world of sneakers, we need to redefine the world of beer," he said. He added the company will break even by early 2018 as every "Bira bottle makes money".
