India's third largest telecom company Idea Cellular on Thursday posted a net profit of ₹575.6 crore for the quarter ended March, down by 38.9% from the corresponding period a year ago. The fall was attributed to higher financing and spectrum fees of Idea’s 4G network. Further, total quarterly revenue grew by 12.6% to ₹9,480 crore.
