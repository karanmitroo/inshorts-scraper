Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has said that a $417 million verdict in a talc powder cancer case should be removed because three jurors were excluded by other panellists from the decision-making process. J&J was ordered to pay the amount in August to a hospitalised woman who claimed that the talc in the company's baby powder causes ovarian cancer.
