Tata Sons on Thursday accused Cyrus Mistry of betraying the trust it had reposed in him. â€œIt's unfortunate that Tata Sons, acting in good faith, did not anticipate such devious moves by Mr. Mistry and thereby did not inform others about dissatisfaction with him," Tata Sons said. However, Tata will do "whatever is required" to deal with this, it added.
