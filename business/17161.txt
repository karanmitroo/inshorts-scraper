The government is readying a Rs 14k-crore scheme to push green vehicles, sources said. The subsidy will be a proportion of the difference between the price of a car running on fossil fuel and that of a green vehicle. The heavy industry ministry has suggested that the maximum subsidy of 35% should be given to pure electric vehicles.
