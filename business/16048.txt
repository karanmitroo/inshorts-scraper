Two weeks after entering US, online restaurant search service Zomato Thursday acquired Turkey's prominent restaurant discovery portal Mekanist in an all-cash deal. "We're excited to be joining forces with them as we continue to grow in one of our most important markets", Zomato said. The move will help Zomato almost double its restaurant coverage   to over 50,000 restaurants across Turkey.
