Private lender Axis Bank emerged as the biggest loser on Sensex as its shares plunged over 8% on Wednesday after it posted a weak quarterly report. The bank had reported an 83% year-on-year decline in net profit for the quarter ended September to â‚¹319 crore. The fall in profits was attributed to the bank's higher provisioning for bad loans.
