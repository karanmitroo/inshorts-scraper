The European Commission on Tuesday demanded technology giant Apple to pay record $14.5 billion to Ireland over receiving illegal tax benefits from the country. "This is illegal under EU state aid rules...It allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses," said EU. The tax figure is nearly 40 times bigger than previously demanded by EU in such cases.
