Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that we should not call people who come from abroad "fair-weather friends", adding, "They are also giving up on things." "They stay away from their families, they learn to navigate this system... So it is not that easy," he added. Stating that India has "very good people", Rajan said it shouldn't ignore talent.
