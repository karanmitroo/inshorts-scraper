British luxury phone maker Vertu has reportedly been acquired by exiled Turkish businessman Hakan Uzan for about â‚¹400 crore. This marks the third time Vertu has changed ownership since it was spun off from Nokia in 2012. Notably, Nokia and Motorola won a lawsuit against Uzan's family in 2003 for defaulting on loans borrowed to launch Turkish mobile carrier Telsim.
