Former Infosys board member Mohandas Pai has said India has over 60 billionaires and each one of them must give 2% of their wealth every year for good causes. "Many of them said we’ve given 50%, but they’ve simply put money into endowments," he added. "I think we're at 20% of what we should be as a country," said Pai.
