Google could be fined over €1 billion (₹7,200 crore) by the European Commission for alleged abuse of its market dominance, reports said. Google has been accused of promoting its shopping service in its search results over services of its competitors. The penalty could surpass the record €1 billion fine slapped by the commission on Intel in 2009 for anti-competitive behaviour.
