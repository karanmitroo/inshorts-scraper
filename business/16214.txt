Gold prices on Tuesday climbed to its highest since October 2014, boosted by safe-haven demand, triggered by tumbling oil prices and weak equities. Spot gold rose to a 12-week high of $1,238.81 an ounce on concerns over the economic impact, with oil trading close to its lowest in nearly six years. Weakness in the dollar also supported the yellow metal.
