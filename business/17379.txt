The Sensex on Friday surged 319 points to end at a new closing peak of 24,693, boosted by a spike in SBI and heavy buying in power shares on hopes of a big push under the incoming Modi govt. The Nifty also jumped 90.70 points to close at a record high of 7,367, surpassing its Thursday's high of 7,276.
