Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday that all efforts are being made to rectify the current “unacceptable” level of NPAs (bad loans) in public sector banks. “They reached this level partly because of indiscretion, partly because of inaction, partly because of challenges in some sectors of the economy, which were evident through high NPA in these sectors,” he added.
