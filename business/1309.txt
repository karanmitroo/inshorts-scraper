Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha has said the government will ensure there's no spectrum shortage so that India doesn't lag behind rest of the world in launching 5G services. A 5G testbed will be operational in six months, Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan said. The government in September laid down a roadmap for the rollout of 5G networks in India by 2020.
