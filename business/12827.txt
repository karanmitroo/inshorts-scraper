Oil companies on Monday announced that the price of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) was slashed by nearly 12%. This is expected to help reduce the financial burden on airlines as the price of the ATF or jet fuel accounts for around 40% of their operating costs. This cut comes amid falling crude oil prices across the world.
