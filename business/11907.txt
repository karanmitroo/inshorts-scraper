An SBI-led consortium of banks on Thursday filed counter objections against Vijay Mallya-led United Breweries Holdings Limited's (UBHL) claim of â‚¹594 crore from them. The UBHL, in its objections filed in the Debt Recovery Tribunal, contended that the lenders had sold the equity shares of Diageo-owned liquor firm United Spirits pledged to them before maturity at a 'cheaper rate.'
