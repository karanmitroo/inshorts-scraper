Seven Air India employees' unions have warned of large-scale protests if NITI Aayog's proposal to privatise the carrier is approved. The unions said they oppose the "arbitrary" recommendations of NITI Aayog and have called it "spokesperson of the private sector". The airline, built over a period of 64 years, is being "demolished within 15 days" by NITI Aayog, they added.
