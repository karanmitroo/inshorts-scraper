Retailers in Tamil Nadu will boycott global cola giants Pepsi and Coca-Cola, along with all their other soft-drink products, from March 1, citing health and environmental concerns. The decision, taken by major traders' associations, aims to promote home-grown businesses and products. Notably, there are 20 lakh shops affiliated with the trade unions, most of which have joined the boycott.
