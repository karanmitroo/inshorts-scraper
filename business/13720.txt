The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday decided to bail out sugar mills by providing sugarcane farmers a direct production-linked subsidy of ₹4.5 per quintal out of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of ₹230 per quintal in the 2015-16 season. Sugar mill owners owe nearly ₹6,500 crore to farmers. The move would cost the exchequer ₹1,147 crore.
