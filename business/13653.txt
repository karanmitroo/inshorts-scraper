Contradicting Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s assertion that India is “not impacted” by the Chinese slowdown, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that China’s economic deceleration adversely affected India. Rajan added that besides a drop in Indian exports to China, many countries “are not exporting to China as much as they did" and are consequently importing less from India.
