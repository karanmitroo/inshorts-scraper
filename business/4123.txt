Martin Shkreli's lawyer has admitted that the Twitter history of former Turing Pharmaceuticals' CEO is "just horrific" and was the most prejudicial part of Shkreli's case. He made the statement during jury selection for the securities fraud trial of Shkreli, who raised an HIV drug's price by 5,400%. Earlier, potential jurors were excused as they couldnâ€™t be impartial towards Shkreli.
