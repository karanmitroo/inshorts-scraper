After Flipkart, popular online retailer Myntra has come under the Enforcement Directorate's scanner for possible violation of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms. The current policy does not allow FDI in business-to-consumer (B2C) category e-commerce while 100% FDI is allowed in the business-to-business (B2B) category. The agency has recently completed an investigation against Flipkart on a similar issue.
