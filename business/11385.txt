The Republic of Panama has officially signed a deal to comply with standards in exchanging tax information as prescribed by global body Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Notably, this comes a month after the 'Panama Papers' data leak which revealed records of over 200,000 offshore companies. However, the new membership does not take effect until 2018.
