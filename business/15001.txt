Bank of America Merrill Lynch in its latest fund manager survey saw, on a valuation basis, that gold was “undervalued” for the first time since August 2009. The bank’s measure termed the precious metal's undervaluation at 1%, which corresponded to the declining trend that has taken gold’s value 40% lower than 2011, when it had hit its all-time high.
