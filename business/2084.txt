Hong Kong's fifth tallest skyscraper, The Centre, was reportedly sold for $5.15 billion (â‚¹33,300 crore) to a consortium led by a Chinese firm. CK Asset Holdings, which is owned by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, had sold 75% of its holding in the 73-storey skyscraper. This would be Hong Kong's most expensive commercial building once the deal is finalised.
