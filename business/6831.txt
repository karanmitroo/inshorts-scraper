The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a petition seeking a probe into documents seized in the Income Tax raids on Sahara and Birla, saying the recovered papers have no conclusive evidence. The petition was filed by NGO Common Cause and senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan. The raids, conducted in 2013-14, also named several politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
