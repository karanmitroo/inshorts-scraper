An investigation has been launched after 'human waste' was found in Coca-Cola cans at a factory in the UK. The incident involved a shipment of empty cans that were delivered to the plant ahead of being filled and sealed. Coca-Cola has said the issue was identified 'immediately' and had no impact on its products on sale.
