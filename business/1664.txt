Bahrain on Saturday blamed Iran for an oil pipeline explosion which temporarily halted oil supplies from Saudi Arabia, and called it a "terrorist act". "The attempt to blow up the Saudi-Bahraini pipeline is a dangerous escalation on Iran's part that aims to harm the world oil industry," Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Khalifa said.
