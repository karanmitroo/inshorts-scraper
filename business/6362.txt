Billionaire investor Warren Buffett in a recent interview said his friend Bill Gates tried to sell him a computer but "that's probably the only sale he didn't make." However, Buffett added that the computer subsequently changed his life for the better. Buffett also spoke about getting turned down by Harvard. "It was the best thing that ever happened," he said.
