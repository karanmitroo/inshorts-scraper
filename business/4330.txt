Yahoo's outgoing CEO Marissa Mayer, who recently stepped down from her post following Yahoo's acquisition by Verizon in a $4.5 billion deal, said she is "looking forward to going back to Gmail." She added that she is "always faster when using a tool she designed herself." Notably, Mayer spent 13 years at Google managing multiple products before she joined Yahoo.
