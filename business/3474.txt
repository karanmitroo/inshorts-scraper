Renault reported record results in the first half of 2017, helping the Renault-Nissan alliance overtake rivals Volkswagen and Toyota to become the world's largest carmaker. The group sold 5,268,079 cars globally, largely due to the addition of Mitsubishi Motors to the alliance. Volkswagen, which was the worldâ€™s biggest carmaker in 2016 despite its diesel scandal, sold 5,155,600 during the period.
