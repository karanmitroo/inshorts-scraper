Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said demonetisation and other "anti-evasion measures" generated direct taxes of â‚¹90,000 crore. Commenting on the re-introduction of Long-Term Capital Gains tax on equities, he said it was a logical step to tax those who are earning 14-15% returns annually. He added this would also encourage corporates to invest surplus cash in creating manufacturing companies.
