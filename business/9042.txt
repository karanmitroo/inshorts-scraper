Tech major Apple recovered 1,000 kg of gold, worth $40 million, from recycled iPhones, iPads, and Macs in 2015. Gold is used in consumer electronics because it is averse to corrosion and a good conductor of electricity. The company is boosting its recycling programmes, including the Apple Renew programme, which lets customers recycle their Apple devices at Apple Stores.
