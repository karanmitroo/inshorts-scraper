Cybersecurity expert John McAfee has asked people to "relax" and not panic about recurring crashes in the value of cryptocurrencies. He said, "Crypto dip was caused by Mike Bell of JP Morgan claiming governments could ban cryptocurrencies...They're rightfully terrified of what we're doing. But it can't be stopped." Earlier, McAfee revealed he used cryptocurrency to pay for prostitutes and porn.
