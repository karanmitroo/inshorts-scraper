Streaming video service Netflix on Tuesday acknowledged that its expansion plans in China have come up short, adding it'll halt any and all launch plans in the country. "The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging," Netflix stated. Netflix will instead license content to local companies in China, from which it reportedly expects modest revenue.
