Beer company AB InBev has raised its takeover offer for SABMiller following the post-Brexit drop in the British Pound. The offer was raised by £1 a share to £45 a share, valuing SABMiller at £79 billion, up from £70 billion previously. The deal, agreed last year, would create the world's biggest beer company, producing around 30% of the world's beer.
