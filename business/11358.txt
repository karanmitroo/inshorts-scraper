Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz on Wednesday said it has put on hold investments in India due to the current ban on diesel vehicles over 2,000 cc in Delhi-NCR. Terming the current uncertainty surrounding diesel vehicles as a "lost opportunity for India", the German company said its investments will be affected in the long term if the Supreme Court's ban continues.
