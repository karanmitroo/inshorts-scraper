PNB officials have told the Enforcement Directorate that Nirav Modi's brother was called at a branch office before a CBI complaint was filed. When the officials insisted him to repay loans, he allegedly remarked, "Do whatever you want."  Nirav Modi along with his family had reportedly fled India in the first week of January before CBI could take any action.
