The government has reportedly directed the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) to probe over 50 firms linked to jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The investigation is in connection with the $1.77-billion fraud detected at Punjab National Bank. The 50 firms are different from the 200 shell firms being probed by the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax Department.
