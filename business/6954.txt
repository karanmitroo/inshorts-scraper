Former RBI Governor D Subbarao on Thursday termed demonetisation as "creative destruction and the most disruptive policy innovation since 1991 reforms" that has helped destroy black money. Subbarao further said that the demonetisation decision is "arguably" leading to a flurry of innovations in the Indian financial sector by way of digitisation of payments.
