The German government on Wednesday confirmed plans to invest around one billion euros for promoting use of electric cars. The plan is aimed at increasing the number of electric cars in Germany from the existing 50,000 to one million by 2020. German electric car buyers will get a 4,000 euro incentive shared equally by the government and the car industry.
