The BSE Sensex on Friday snapped its four-day losing streak to close 82.50 points higher at 24,934.33, while the NSE Nifty gained 33.05 points to settle at 7,601.35. Analysts attributed the gains to value-buying in blue-chip stocks, recovery in the rupee, and positive cues from other Asian and European markets tracking the rise in Chinese stock markets.
