Three crew members were grounded by Air India for letting a colleague from another department sleep on the floor of the galley in first class. Some first class passengers, who noticed the man sleeping, complained to the airline's chief Ashwani Lohani. â€œWhen Lohani was informed of this, he was furious and asked the crew to be grounded immediately," sources said.
