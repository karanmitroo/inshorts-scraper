Walt Disney's Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has warned that "an all-out trade war with China would be damaging to Disney’s business and to business in general”. He further said that alienating the Chinese market is something “we have to be very careful about”. Notably, US President Donald Trump has threatened to levy 45% tariff on imports from China.
