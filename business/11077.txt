Russia on Wednesday unveiled a medium-range passenger aircraft, manufactured by a subsidiary of state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation. The company said that the aircraft would be 15% cheaper to operate than other current generation aircraft. The plane, called MC-21, will begin serial production next year and contracts with multiple domestic and foreign airlines have been reportedly agreed.
