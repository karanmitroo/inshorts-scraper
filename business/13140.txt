Chinese stock markets made a slight recovery on Friday, with the CSI 300 index gaining 2.04%. Analysts attributed the gains to a likely purchase of shares by Chinese state-backed funds and the suspension of the recently implemented circuit breaker rules, which drew criticism for aggravating the sell-off crisis. The CSI 300 index has plunged over 10% this week.
