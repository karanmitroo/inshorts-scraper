Masayoshi Son-led SoftBank Group is reportedly planning an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of its mobile phone unit SoftBank Corp this year. The IPO, potentially the biggest by a Japanese company in nearly two decades, could raise around $18 billion. Softbank, which has a market value of about $91.5 billion, plans to list the unit in Tokyo and London, reports said.
