On the Public Interest Litigations (PILs) filed in the $1.77-billion PNB scam, the Supreme Court said that it's fashionable to file PILs after seeing news headlines. "It's clear that the petitioner is seeking publicity...Such PILs are a gross abuse of process," the court said. The SC further refused to interfere in PNB's case against jeweller Nirav Modi at this stage.
