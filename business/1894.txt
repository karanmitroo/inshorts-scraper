New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the country will ban foreigners buying existing homes from early 2018 to make property more affordable for its citizens. The proposed ban would not apply to Australians as New Zealanders are exempt from a similar policy in Australia. However, foreigners could still continue to buy residential land to build new homes.
