Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday termed infrastructure building a "major challenge" and said India needs about $1 trillion (approximately â‚¹67 lakh crore) for new roads, airports and ports. Bureaucratic hurdles and the government's indecisiveness were the main problems plaguing the sector, not the lack of the funds, he added. Infrastructure will add 2% to India's GDP, Gadkari asserted.
