The Centre on Tuesday proposed to lower the limit of cash transactions to ₹2 lakh from the earlier proposal of ₹3 lakh in the Union Budget. The penalty for violating it will be a fine equivalent to the amount of transaction, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia tweeted. The move aims to discourage cash payments, as well as to curb black money.
