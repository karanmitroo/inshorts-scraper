RBI Governor Urjit Patel has said that India's economic growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters to above 7%. He said, "We need to take into account the transitory effects relating to GST," adding, "We have started seeing the upturn." He said inflation target should be achieved without losing sight of supporting economic growth.
