The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the short-term indicative policy rate (repo rate) and cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged at 7.75% and 4% respectively. However, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) was slashed by 50 bps to 21.5% at the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review. RBI had announced a surprise cut of 25 basis points in repo rate last month.
