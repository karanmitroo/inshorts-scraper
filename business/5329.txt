Hindustan Unilever has argued that advertisements of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which runs Amul, were guilty of disparaging frozen desserts. The Kwality Walls ice-cream maker said identifying a brand by name wasn't necessary for an ad to be guilty of “general disparagement”. Amul had argued its ads didn't hurt Kwality Walls because they didn't refer to it by name.
