Air India raised ₹7,000 crore by selling nine Dreamliner planes to a Singaporean leasing company under a Sale and Lease Back agreement which allows the airline to continue using the planes but without ownership. The funds will reportedly be used for partial repayment for Boeing planes the airline bought earlier. The national carrier continues to remain in ₹40,000 crore debt.
