The Supreme Court on Friday admitted the income tax (I-T) department's appeal challenging a Bombay High Court judgement that favoured Vodafone India, the Indian arm of Vodafone Group, in a transfer pricing tax dispute. Vodafone had earlier challenged the jurisdiction of the I-T department that sought to add â‚¹8,500 crore to the company's taxable income retrospectively for the fiscal 2007-08.
