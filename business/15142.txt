Swiss National Bankâ€™s new report claimed that money held by Indians in Swiss banks had fallen by over 10% in 2014 to come down at 1.8 billion Swiss francs. This is the second lowest amount Indians have held in Swiss banks after 2012 and is being attributed to the enhanced clampdown against the secret wall of Switzerland's banking system.
