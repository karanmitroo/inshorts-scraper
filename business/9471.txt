India on Friday lost its World Trade Organization appeal against a US complaint on discrimination against importers in the solar power sector. The WTO upheld that India violated rules by requiring solar power developers to use Indian-made products. Notably, this comes after India complained to WTO against subsidies given to the solar industry in eight US states.
