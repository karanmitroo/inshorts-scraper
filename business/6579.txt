The Reserve Bank of India may do away with the weekly withdrawal limits from banks as well as ATMs by the end of next month, according to bankers. This is because the cash crunch situation across the country is easing gradually. The RBI had recently raised the ATM withdrawal limit to ₹10,000 a day from ₹4,500 a day.
