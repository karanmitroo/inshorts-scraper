An Indian arbitration court has restrained Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications (RCom) and two of its companies from transferring or selling any assets without its permission. This comes after telecom equipment maker Ericsson moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover unpaid dues of ₹1,150 crore from RCom. Notably, RCom owed banks about ₹45,000 crore as of March 2017.
