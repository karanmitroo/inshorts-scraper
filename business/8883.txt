Former UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani has said the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is "like being on a highway without toll gates", as it is open, inclusive and gives opportunities for innovation. Unlike payment systems in the US and China, UPI is not controlled by any key player, he added. UPI will soon offer features like pre-authorised transactions and biometric authentication.
