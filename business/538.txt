In the Union Budget 2018, the government has provided a standard deduction of ₹40,000 from salary income to employees. But it also took away existing annual transport allowance of ₹19,200 and ₹15,000 medical reimbursement. So, the net taxable income of employees under 60 years of age will be a reduction of ₹5,800 from salary income.
