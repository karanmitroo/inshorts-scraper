The Reserve Bank of India has set the ‘ways and means advances’ (WMA) limit for the central government at ₹25,000 crore for the October-March period. WMA are advances given by the RBI to the government to meet temporary mismatches in the receipts and payments. However, the RBI retains the flexibility to revise the limits in consultation with the Centre.
