British banking major HSBC on Thursday announced that it will almost halve its branches from 50 to 26 in India, which will lead to 300 job cuts. The bank said the impacted branches account for about 10% of the bank's customer base in the country. HSBC added that the reduction in branches is due to customers' adoption of digital solutions.
