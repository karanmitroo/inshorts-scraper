ICICI Prudential has agreed to take over the life insurance business of Sahara Group's subsidiary Sahara Life, which was shut down by insurance regulator IRDAI in June. The administration of Sahara Life was taken over by the regulator and it was asked to stop issuing new policies, marking the first time IRDAI took such a step in its 18-year history.
