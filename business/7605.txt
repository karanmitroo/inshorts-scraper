Godrej group Chairman Adi Godrej has said that setting lower direct and corporate tax rates is an effective strategy to prevent black money creation. "If taxes are reasonable and modest, then people donâ€™t deal in black money," he added. Godrej also advocated for an automatic approval mechanism and has supported the idea of state-funded elections.
