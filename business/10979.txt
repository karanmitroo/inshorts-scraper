Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu on Wednesday flagged off India's first time-tabled freight train, named ‘Cargo Express’, from Delhi to Bengaluru. The move aims to reduce the delay and uncertainty over the time schedule for delivery of goods. Earlier, passenger trains in the country used to get preference over goods trains for transportation across busy routes.
