McLaren's CEO Mike Flewitt in a recent interview revealed that the company was in talks with technology giant Apple for a takeover, but it never reached a stage where Apple made a bid. He said, "They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition".
