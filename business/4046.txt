J&K Assembly will most likely pass the GST Bill by July 6, State Finance Minister Haseen Drabu said on Friday. Notably, J&K is the only state to have missed the June 30 deadline for GST launch. Drabu had earlier said J&K government was "genuinely interested" in implementing the new tax regime as it would last for the next 30-40 years.
