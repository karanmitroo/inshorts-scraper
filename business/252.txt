Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said that the government will chase down those who cheat the banking system. Commenting on PNB's $1.77-billion fraud case against jeweller Nirav Modi, Jaitley said, "Auditors have to look inwards as to why they were unable to detect irregularities." "It seems like bank management was found lacking," he added.
