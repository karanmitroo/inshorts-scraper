Global debt in the non-financial sector hit an all-time high of $152 trillion in 2015, which is over twice the size of the global economy, IMF data showed. This includes debt held by governments, non-financial firms, and households, with the private sector responsible for two-thirds of the debt. The IMF has urged the governments to "intervene early" to prevent recessions.
