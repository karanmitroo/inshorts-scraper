The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which includes Airtel and Idea, has written to the Prime Minister’s Office stating existing operators are not “obliged to entertain" Reliance Jio's interconnect requests, which are "anti-competitive". COAI sought the PMO's intervention to "restore fair competition". Earlier, Jio accused operators of not releasing enough interconnection ports.
