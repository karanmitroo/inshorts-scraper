The Centre has given more time to seven Special Economic Zone (SEZ) developers and units, including Kerala State IT Infrastructure and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, to execute their projects. The decision was taken by the Board of Approval (BoA), which provides a single window clearance mechanism for these zones. Earlier, the BoA had also cancelled four SEZ projects.
