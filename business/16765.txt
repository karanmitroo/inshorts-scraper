According to the latest data by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), released on Sep-29, 56 coal-based power plants are left with fuel stocks of less than 7 days, while 11 power stations were left with nil stocks on the day. The shortage of stocks owes to less supplies from Coal India, due to wanting supply of wagons and transportation constraints.
