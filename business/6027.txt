Jet Airways on Thursday announced a reciprocal codeshare partnership with Hong Kong Airlines. It will place its marketing code 9W on select Hong Kong Airlines' flights while the latter will place its marketing code HX on Jet Airways flights. Codesharing allows an airline to book its passengers on partner carriers and provide travel to destinations where it has no presence.
