A statement from the White House congratulating oil giant ExxonMobil on the expansion of its operations, copied an entire paragraph from the company’s press release. The statement was titled “President Trump Congratulates ExxonMobil for Job-Creating Investment Program". Last year, First Lady Melania Trump was accused of plagiarism after she used phrases from Michelle Obama's speech.
