General Electric has lost $100 billion in market capitalisation this year, showing losses higher than the current market cap of Goldman Sachs. Its stock declined 13% last week erasing $26 billion off its value in GE's worst weekly drop since March 2009. John Flannery, who took over as CEO in August, said the company's third-quarter results were "completely unacceptable".
