International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde has stated that regulatory action on cryptocurrencies is "inevitable". "It's clearly a domain where we need international regulation and proper supervision," she said. She added that the IMF is actively trying to prevent digital currencies from being used to launder money or finance terrorism.
