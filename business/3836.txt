Market regulator SEBI has directed Goldmine Agro and its directors to refund investors money that it had raised illegally. SEBI also imposed a ban on the firm and its directors from accessing capital markets for four years after the refund. SEBI observed that securities issued by the firm required compulsory listing on recognised stock exchanges, which it failed to do.
