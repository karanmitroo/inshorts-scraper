The United States is not opposed to foreign banks doing business with Iran in line with the nuclear deal reached last year, US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday. Kerry said, "Unfortunately there seems to be some confusion among some foreign banks". The Iranian government earlier claimed it was not getting the full economic benefits of the deal.
