The CBI has alleged that a tax auditor for Nirav Modi Group, Sanjay Rambhia, was aware of â‚¹5,100-crore worth unsecured loans availed by three firms but did not raise a red flag. Rambhia's lawyer, however, said that Rambhia had reported the transactions to tax authorities. Instead of being made an accused, Rambhia could be the "best witness", his lawyer added.
