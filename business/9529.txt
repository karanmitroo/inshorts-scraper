The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has ordered telecom operators including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and BSNL to submit their call traffic details to examine traffic pattern on their networks, an official said. This comes after Reliance Jio Infocomm accused other operators of not providing sufficient interconnection points, which had led to call failures during its test trials.
