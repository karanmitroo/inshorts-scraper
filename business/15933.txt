The Sahara Group on Thursday promised legal action against US-based firm Mirach Capital Group, after their fund-raising talks fell through. Mirach had earlier agreed to raise $1.6-billion for Subrata Roy's bail. However, Sahara later detected forgery in the bank authorization letters, as Mirach had no capital of their own. Sahara has now accused the former benefactor of "gross criminal conduct".
