Bharti Airtel's Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal while talking about rival Reliance Jio's free voice calling on Wednesday said, "TRAI needs to settle the issue of Jio's free tariffs. Nothing can be free for a lifetime". This comes after TRAI found no faults with Jio's tariff plans. Mittal said Airtel will respond to the government regarding the penalties slapped on it.
