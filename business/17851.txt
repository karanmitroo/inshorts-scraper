Some of the most popular small cars sold in India, including Maruti Alto 800, Tata Nano, Ford Figo, Hyundai i10 and Volkswagen Polo, have failed crash tests conducted by the car safety watchdog, Global NCAP. These cars received zero for adult protection ratings in a frontal impact at 64km/hr, thereby showing high risk of life-threatening injuries in road accidents.
