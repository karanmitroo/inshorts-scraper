Restaurants levy several charges over and above the food bill, including a 15% service tax, collected by the central government. The VAT varies from state to state but cannot be charged on the items not prepared in the restaurant. A service charge, included with the food bill, is essentially the tip given to a waiter and is now voluntary.
