Japanese operator NTT Docomo, which is in a financial dispute with Tata Sons, said that the Indian government will need to take action to resolve the disagreement. Docomo is trying to sell its stake in Tata Teleservices for at least 50% of the original investment. However, as per RBI, such a payment would violate rules governing investments from outside India.
