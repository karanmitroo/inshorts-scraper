According to currency traders cited by Reuters, the RBI likely sold dollars on Tuesday through state-owned banks in a bid to prevent sharper falls in the rupee after reports of explosions at the Brussels airport hit global markets. The traders said the intervention started when the rupee fell to around 66.83 per dollar levels, down from 66.5250/66.5350 close on Monday.
