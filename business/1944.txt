US-based startup Zenefits and its Co-founder Parker Conrad have been fined nearly $1 million by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm was accused of making "misleading statements and omissions" to investors over compliance with state insurance laws. Zenefits and Conrad consented to SEC's order without admitting or denying the findings that they violated federal securities laws.
