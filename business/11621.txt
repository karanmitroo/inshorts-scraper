A US court on Monday ordered conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to pay $55 million in damages to a woman who alleged that the company's talc-based powders caused her to develop ovarian cancer. The verdict is the second straight loss to the company which is currently facing 1,200 lawsuits for not adequately warning consumers about its talc-based products' cancer risks.
