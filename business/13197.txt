Around 50 teams from the Income Tax department raided the premises of Apollo Hospitals across multiple cities on charges of tax evasion. Patient service logs and business documents were seized in the raid and will be analysed later, officials said. An Apollo Hospitals spokesperson said the hospitals offered full cooperation and sought to reassure its patients and stakeholders.
