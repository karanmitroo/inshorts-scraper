The Budget was initially printed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan but in 1950, it was leaked and the printing venue shifted to a press at the Minto Road in Delhi. In 1980, a special government press in the North Block's basement became the permanent place for printing the Budget. The officials stay in the press till the speech is over.
