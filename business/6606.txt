US President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order formally withdrawing the country from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, following through on his campaign promise. Trump called the move a "great thing for the American worker". The TPP was aimed at increasing free trade between 12 countries along the Pacific Rim by lowering non-tariff and tariff trade barriers.
