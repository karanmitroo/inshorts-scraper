Airlines have asked the government to set the Goods and Services Tax (GST) at 15% and retain some existing tax exemptions in a bid to prevent fare hikes. If GST exceeds 15%, it would hamper growth in the world's fastest growing aviation market, an official said. Airlines expect to see a 9-15% jump in airfares if GST is set higher.
