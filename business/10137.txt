The Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties said it found sufficient evidence of alleged chemical dumping by Russia, Indonesia, Georgia and Iran, and has begun probing the case. India's major fertiliser producers have complained regarding the dumping of ammonium nitrate, used in the fertiliser sector. The DGAD will study its effects and recommend the anti-dumping duty to be levied.
