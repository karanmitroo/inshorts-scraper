The Income Tax department has found over ₹10 crore, most of it in new ₹2,000 notes, during a raid on multiple lockers in a Bank of Maharashtra branch. The lockers belonged to a US-based MNC, according to reports. Raids were conducted after the I-T department was suspicious of excessive operations being carried out in these lockers.
