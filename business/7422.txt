Telecom regulator TRAI has said that call failure rate at interconnection points is still “way above the benchmark”, adding that it will hold a review meet with telcos Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance Jio over this. Further, TRAI will continue to consider it “unsatisfactory and violative” if benchmarks are not met, Chairman RS Sharma said.
