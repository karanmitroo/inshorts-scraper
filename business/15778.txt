US resident Ryan Pate was arrested in UAE after posting deriding comments on Facebook about his employer Global Aerospace Logistics (Gal), while he was in America. The dispute with the company was due to the refusal of a sick-leave. Ryan, who was going to resign, was arrested under UAE's cyber-slander laws that make deriding through internet an offence.
