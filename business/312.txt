India-born Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa-owned Fairfax Holdings has proposed to buy 51% stake in Kerala-based lender Catholic Syrian Bank (CSB). The deal will value CSB at over â‚¹1,200 crore. If the deal is successful, it will be the first takeover of an Indian bank by a foreign non-banking financial entity after the RBI modified ownership rules in May last year.
