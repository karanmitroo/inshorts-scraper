Oil price extended its rally on Friday, barrelling into higher $40 territory and toward multi-week gains on expectations of a production freeze by major exporters and stronger seasonal fuel demand in the US. Oil has surged about 55% from 12-year lows after the OPEC floated the idea of a production freeze two months ago, boosting oil price from below $30.
