Ramdev has said Patanjali will be turned into a "non-profit" entity, and that they have used all profits for charity since inception. "We'll not list Patanjali on the stock exchanges. We will list Patanjali in people's hearts," he said. Ramdev has reportedly set up a charitable organisation, Patanjali Seva Trust, which will be the holding entity for Patanjali Group companies.
