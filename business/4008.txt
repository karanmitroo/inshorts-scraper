American file hosting service Dropbox is readying for an initial public offering that could come later this year, which would make it the biggest IPO by a technology company since Snapchat. Dropbox was valued at almost $10 billion in a private fundraising round in 2014. Snapchat's IPO valued the company at $24 billion earlier this year.
