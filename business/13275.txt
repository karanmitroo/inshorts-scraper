A California court directed Indore-based Pratibha Syntex to pay a $100,000 fine within 30 days for using pirated software to get an unfair advantage over American businesses. This reportedly is the first time a US state got a legally enforceable judgment against an international firm for such violations. The company also needs to conduct four software audits and fix violations.
