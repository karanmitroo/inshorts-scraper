NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said some states have improved in terms of ease of doing business after being ranked very low on an index, crediting this to the "name and shame" system. Kant said, "When we started ranking states on ease of doing business...the states that were ranked lower in first year, they started improving later."
