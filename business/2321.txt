Reliance Jio has revealed terms and conditions for its JioPhone and set a threshold of recharges worth â‚¹1,500 per year, in order to be eligible for refund. Failing to do so, the company will take back the device, Jio said. It said this will "prevent misuse or hoarding of the JioPhone and to encourage usage of its world-class 4G services."
