Extending its losses for 5th straight season, the Indian rupee on Wednesday logged a drop of 22 paise to fall sharply to 8-1/2-month low of 61.96 against dollar. Rupee dropped following sustained dollar demand from oil importers, slowdown in inflows and weakness in local stock market. This is its weakest closing since finishing at 62.04 on March 3.
