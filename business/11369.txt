Capital markets regulator Sebi has tightened the norms for participatory notes (P-notes) in order to check misuse of these instruments in round-tripping and money laundering. The decision comes following the recommendations of a Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team on black money. P-notes enable foreign investors to invest in Indian markets through registered FIIs.
