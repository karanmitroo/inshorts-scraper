Danish toymaker Lego announced plans to cut around 1,400 jobs, majority of them by the end of 2017, as it reported a 5% fall in mid-year revenue. "We are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this," said Chairman JÃ¸rgen Vig Knudstorp. Notably, the company currently employs around 18,200 people.
