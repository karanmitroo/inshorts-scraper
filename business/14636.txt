The bloodbath on Dalal Street ended on Monday with the Sensex losing almost six percent, as it closed at 25,741.56 or about 1625 points lower. The Nifty lost 491 points to close at 7,809. The biggest crash since 2009 was attributed to a sell-off in Chinese markets and weak global cues. The rupee also sank to a two-year low.
