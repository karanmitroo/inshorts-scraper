Zee Entertainment, which operates channels Zee TV and Zee Cinema, reported a nearly 570% increase in profit in the March quarter. Net profit rose to ₹1,514.2 crore from ₹226.5 crore in the previous year period. This rise was because of a one-time gain on the sale of its sports business, TEN Sports, to Sony Pictures Networks India.
