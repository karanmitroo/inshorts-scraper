United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz on Wednesday refused to resign, saying, "I was hired to make United better and we’ve been doing that and that’s what I’ll continue to do." Munoz said United hasn't been able to contact the passenger dragged off the flight. "I do look forward to a time when I can... apologise directly to him," he added.
