Chinese president Xi Jinping on Saturday vowed to open the Chinese economy "even wider" to foreign businesses and play an even greater role in "economic globalisation". This comes after US President Barack Obama pushed for a business partnership with Japan and 10 other economies, excluding China. "Close and exclusive arrangements are not the right choice," Jinping added.
