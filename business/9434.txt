Financial credit rating service Moody's on Monday said the Indian banking sector is moving past the worst of the bad loans, although the state-run banks remain a weakness. This comes amid the rise of gross bad loans of Indian banks in the last one year. Further, Moody's said the Indian banking sector may stabilise over the next 12-18 months.
