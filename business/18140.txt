Infosys, accused of seeking visas fraudulently by putting workers on relatively cheaper visitor visas rather than work visas, will be punished by US government with the largest immigration fine ever. The fine is expected to be about $35-million and with this, Infosys could undercut competitors in bids for programming, accounting, and other works performed for clients like Wal-Mart and Cisco.
