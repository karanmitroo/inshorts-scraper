Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan in an interview said that demonetisation has hit the nation's poor the hardest. Demonetisation cannot be described as an economic success at this point, Rajan stated. In his book 'I Do What I Do', Rajan further revealed that RBI was, at no point during his term, asked to make a decision on demonetisation.
