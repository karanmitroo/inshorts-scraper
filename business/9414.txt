Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's Founder Jack Ma first came across the internet in 1995 during a trip to USA and his first web search was 'Beer'. Believing “this Internet thing” was going to change the world, Ma founded the first commercial website in China called 'China Pages'. He later founded Alibaba in 1999, which went public on September 19, 2014.
