Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Sunday said, "Amazon better behave," adding that the e-commerce major should desist from being "flippant about Indian symbols and icons". "Indifference will be at your own peril," Das further said in a post on Twitter. His comments come after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj targeted Amazon for selling doormats with the Indian flag.
