South Korea's Hyundai Merchant Marine said on Tuesday that it may submit a preliminary bid for Hanjin Shipping assets used in the Asia-to-US routes. Hanjin had last week put up manpower and logistics systems, five container ships and 10 overseas businesses for sale. Hanjin is the world's seventh-largest container carrier and had filed for bankruptcy in August.
