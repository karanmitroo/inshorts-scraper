Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej on Tuesday said, “Patanjali seems to be leveraging Baba Ramdev’s image in yoga and ayurveda quite well, but most of their sales are in simple products like ghee and honey". "Their sales in value-added products are still relatively small,” Godrej added. He further said that Godrej competes with Patanjali only in the toilet soap segment.
