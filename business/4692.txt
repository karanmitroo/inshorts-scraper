Vikram Mehra, MD of 110-year-old music company Saregama, said, "We were the king of cassettes and CDs but when the digital world hit us, we could not move fast enough." "We couldn't strike the right business model to monetise the content we were buying," he added. The company returned to active film music acquisition last year after a six-year gap.
