Financial year 2013-14 has seen the highest increase in gold smuggling in India's recent history. From a mere Rs 100 crore worth of gold seized in FY 2012-13, this FY various agencies have seized Rs 565 crore worth of gold - more than a fivefold increase. Notably, the value of gold actually smuggled could be over 10-20 times of this.
