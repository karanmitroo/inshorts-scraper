Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan has denied reports claiming he is growing tired of heading the lender, saying, "I am not weary of Deutsche Bank." "I am 150% in and I am around to see this reversal," Cryan added after the bank announced a strategic overhaul. Cryan became the CEO of the German banking major in 2015.
