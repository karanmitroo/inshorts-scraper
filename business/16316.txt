The rupee on Tuesday appreciated by 29 paise to rise for the first time in five sessions, due to fresh selling of the US currency by exporters. The Indian unit closed higher at 63.38 against the dollar, also aided by foreign fund inflows in domestic debt. The rupee had ended at 63.67 on Monday to hit over a 13-month low.
