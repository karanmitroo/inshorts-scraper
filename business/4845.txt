Billionaire Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett, 86, said, "If I die tonight, I think the stock would go up tomorrow.” “And there’d be speculation about breakups and all that sort of thing, so it would be a good Wall Street story,” Buffett added. He further said he hoped the person who succeeds him will already be "very rich".
