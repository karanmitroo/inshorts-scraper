Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday faced charges of fraud after a state judge in San Jose refused claims of not deceiving developer Mircea Voskerician in $1.7 million land deal. Zuckerberg had allegedly bought rights of Voskerician's house on a 40% discount, promising him referrals to boost business. Voskerician has accused Zuckerberg of not keeping the promise after the deal.
