Airtel has accused Reliance Jio of trying to transfer its costs to the rest of the industry. Jio is seeking to end call termination charges to transfer costs, currently at â‚¹20,000 crore annually. Such cost transfer will allow Jio to use its "muscle power" and price services in a predatory manner to kill the rest of the industry, Airtel added.
