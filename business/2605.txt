Air Berlin cancelled about 100 flights on Tuesday after an "unusually high number" of pilots called in sick, potentially hampering an attempt to find investors for the Germany's second-largest airline. The airline, however, cited "operative reasons" for the cancellations. Notably, Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection last month after its biggest shareholder, Etihad Airways, withdrew funding.
