iPhone graphics chip supplier Imagination Technologies has said that it is open to being acquired, three months after announcing that Apple will stop using its intellectual property in new products. The company lost 70% of its value on announcing the end of its deal with Apple. However, Imagination claims Apple cannot build its own chips without infringing on its patents.
