Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani has said Future Group is a consumer goods company and not a retailer anymore. He said Future group is an FMCG firm in the sense that it has its own brands in food and fashion, and delivers goods through its own retail chain. He added that retail is the distribution part of his consumer business.
