The government on Wednesday released an anti-profiteering application form for consumers to complain against businesses which don't pass on benefits of lower GST rates. A complainant will have to mention product price and the applicable rates both in the pre and post-GST. The complaint will have to be backed by evidence like invoice, price list, and detailed working sheet.
