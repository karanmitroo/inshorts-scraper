Nepal has terminated all agreements with Indian construction firm Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (ILFS) to build a 76-km long expressway project worth $1 billion, connecting Kathmandu with the southern Terai region near the Indian border. ILFS said that the expressway would have reduced the travel time from Kathmandu to Nijgadh (around 136 km) to under an hour.
