BJP youth wing Secretary JVR Arun, who actively campaigned for the demonetisation drive, was arrested by Tamil Nadu police with notes worth over ₹20 lakh. Arun earlier said, “For the progress of my country, I am ready to stand in the queue." Arun was given enough time to produce details, but he could not explain the money's source, police said.
