The demonetisation of high-value bank notes in India may drag down the economic growth in Nepal, according to a research group. The group revised down its forecast for Nepal's economic growth to 2.2% for the current fiscal year, from an earlier estimate of 2.5%. Nepal's economy grew at nearly 0.8% in FY 2016 after the earthquake in 2015.
