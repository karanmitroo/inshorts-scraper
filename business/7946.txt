Ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry on Tuesday said that Tata Group was paying lobbyist and former PR manager Niira Radia's Vaishnavi Communications â‚¹40 crore annually. Earlier in 2009, Radia's telephonic conversations with senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses were taped by the I-T Department and became the matter of a probe. The tapes led to the uncovering of the 2G scam.
