Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said cryptocurrencies take power from centralised systems and "put it back into people's hands". However, he cautioned that cryptocurrencies come with the risk of being harder to control. Zuckerberg further added, "I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services."
