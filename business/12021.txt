The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to an 8-month high of 52.4 in March from February's 51.1, driven by stronger demand which allowed companies to raise prices. Further, the sub-index for new orders also rose to an 8-month high of 53.9 from 52.3. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 signals contraction.
