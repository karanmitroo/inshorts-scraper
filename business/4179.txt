Dealers of General Motors, which decided to stop selling vehicles in India, will demonstrate at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday to protest against the automaker. They are unhappy with GM's offer of just 12% of total investments they've made as compensation. GM dealers would be sitting on dharna to draw attention of the concerned ministries to loss of about 15,000 jobs.
