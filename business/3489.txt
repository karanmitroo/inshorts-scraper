Casino billionaire Steve Wynn has revealed that his Macau casino lost $10 million (₹64 crore) in April. The loss occurred at baccarat tables of the $4.2 billion resort where all of the high rollers won millions of dollars even under extreme probability swings. “We had probably the most unique statistical anomaly in my 50 years of doing this,” Wynn stated.
