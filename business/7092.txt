Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has told telecom regulator TRAI that its latest offer does not violate any of the existing norms. This came after TRAI sought clarifications from Jio on extending the free call and data offer till March 31, after the promotional 90-day period expired. The ‘Happy New Year Offer’ was different and doesn't qualify as predatory, Jio explained.
