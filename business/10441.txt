The SBI on Friday announced a reduction of 5 basis points across maturities in its marginal cost lending rate (the benchmark rate at which banks lend to new borrowers) effective August 1. The rate cut follows a drop in the benchmark government bond yield to a three-year low of 7.19%, which signifies a fall in banks' overall borrowing cost.
