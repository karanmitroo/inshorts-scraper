Pressure from the government forced Air India to withdraw its flying ban on Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad after he assaulted an airline employee, reports said. “We had to withdraw the ban despite the fact that the MP did not apologise,” an official said. The ban was revoked after a Civil Aviation Ministry letter “advised” the airline to do so.
