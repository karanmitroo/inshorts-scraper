The US is seeking to recover $540 million in assets, including jewellery and film rights, that were reportedly purchased with funds misappropriated from Malaysia’s 1MDB wealth fund. The items include a painting by Pablo Picasso, and rights to the 2014 film “Dumb and Dumber To”. Notably, from 2009 through 2015, $4.5 billion was diverted by high-level officials of 1MDB.
