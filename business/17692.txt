India's current account deficit is likely to narrow to a 6-year low of 2% of its GDP in FY14, but may expand to 2.7% in FY15 as imports pick up, rating agency Crisil said Tuesday. The CAD, which had touched an all-time high of 4.8% in FY13, will improve this fiscal year due to heavy imports contraction, the agency added.
