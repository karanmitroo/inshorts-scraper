State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Thursday posted a 12% year-on-year rise in net profit to ₹4,416 crore for the quarter ended March. Profits were primarily attributed to write backs of impairment losses worth nearly ₹850 crore borne in the previous quarter, as oil prices rebounded. Total income from operations, however, fell 24% to ₹16,385 crore.
