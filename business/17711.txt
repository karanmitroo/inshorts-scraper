Indian politicians are expected to spend Rs.300 crore ($5-bn) on campaigning for elections next month - a sum second only to the most-expensive US presidential campaign ($7-bn) of all time, according to Centre for Media Studies. The campaign spending is expected to give a boost to the economy. However, much of the spending will remain in its thriving black economy.
