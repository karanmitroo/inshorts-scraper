Denying reports of Baba Ramdev being summoned to a Rohtak court over his alleged ‘beheading’ remarks, a spokesperson said the “remark had been presented wrongly”. The court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Ramdev. Notably, Ramdev at a 2016 gathering said he can “behead lakhs of people refusing to chant 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' if he weren’t bound by law”.
