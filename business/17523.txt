In what's a first in India, e-commerce giant Amazon has started piloting the concept of enlisting kiranas as delivery points, starting in Bangalore. "We have identified and trained staff at small kiosks and stores, run by individual entrepreneurs, to be our shipment pick-up points," Amazon India country head Amit Agarwal said. Amazon will pay a fee to these small retailers.
