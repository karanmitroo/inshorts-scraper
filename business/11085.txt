The Chinese government on Wednesday expressed concern over the anti-dumping probe initiated by India in April against the import of steel from China. The Indian government is expected to conduct a fair investigation according to WTO rules, it added. Anti-dumping duty  applies to goods whose prices upon export to a foreign market are lower than those in the domestic market.
