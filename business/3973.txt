Former Tata Finance MD Dilip Pendse committed suicide at his office in Mumbai on Wednesday. Police found a suicide note, which quoted "personal reasons" as the reason behind his suicide. In June last year, Pendse and three other entities were barred by SEBI from the capital market for manipulations at the time of the firm's rights issue in 2001.
