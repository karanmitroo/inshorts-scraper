The Times Television Network (TTN) has reportedly issued guidelines to its journalists to only retweet stories appearing on TTN or Times Group's official twitter handle, Facebook and other social media pages. The organisation has barred the journalists from retweeting even their own published stories unless they have been tweeted by the channel's official handles, said the reports.
