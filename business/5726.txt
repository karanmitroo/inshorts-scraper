A former security guard for a board member of Heinz has been accused of insider trading before the ketchup maker’s 2013 takeover by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital. The guard was working at the board member’s home around the period of discussion over Heinz's acquisition. He bought Heinz shares and after the takeover announcement, sold them for a $44,000 profit.
