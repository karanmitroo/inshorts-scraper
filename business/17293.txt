Gold continued its weak momentum for the sixth straight session, hitting a fresh ten-month low in the domestic bullion market Saturday due to reduced offtake by stockists. Standard gold (99.5 purity) dropped by Rs 70 to conclude at Rs 26,605 per 10g, while pure gold (99.9 purity) also fell by the same margin to end at Rs 26,755 per 10g.
