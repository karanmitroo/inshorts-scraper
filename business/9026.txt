The spectrum auction ended on Thursday, with the government raising around ₹66,000 crore, about ₹5 lakh crore short of the targeted base sale price of ₹5.63 lakh crore, reports said. The five-day sale ended after 31 bidding rounds, but the telecom operators did not buy the premium 700 MHz and 900 MHz high-speed internet and data services bands.
