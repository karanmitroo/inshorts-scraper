Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has said that pilot in command of a flight should promptly inform the concerned Air Traffic Controller (ATC) in case anyone onboard has suspected communicable disease. The requirement is being put in place to "facilitate provision of medical equipment and personnel for the management of public health risk on arrival of aircraft".
