The government is not considering inflation-linked Dearness Allowance (DA) to subscribers of the Employees' Pension Scheme, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said on Wednesday. The DA "cannot be left open-ended by linking it (pension) with inflation which is variable", he said, adding that the government has notified a minimum monthly pension of â‚¹1,000 for EPS subscribers from September 1, 2014.
