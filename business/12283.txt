A Hyderabad court has issued non-bailable warrants against liquor baron Vijay Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines' Chief Financial Officer A Raghunath. The court ordered the police to produce the duo before it on April 13. The warrants were issued after GMR Hyderabad International Airport filed a petition seeking Mallya's prosecution for defaulting on payments and issuing cheques that bounced.
