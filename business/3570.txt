The government on Monday said that NDTV is trying to mislead both the media and the general public, and indulging in a blame game. The government said the Income Tax Department's penalty of â‚¹436.8 crore for tax evaded by NDTV is not false. This comes after NDTV published a statement titled 'Income Tax department lies about NDTV: Silencing the press'.
