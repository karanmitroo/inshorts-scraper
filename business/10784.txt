The subsidiary banks of German financial firm Deutsche Bank and the Spanish Santander Group have failed the US Federal Reserve's annual 'stress test', conducted to gauge how banks would fare during a financial crisis. Thirty-one of the 33 big US banks passed this test. The Fed gave Morgan Stanley conditional clearance and asked it to submit a 'rectified' capital plan.
