A high-profile team from Indian Railways will consult China for a feasibility study to build the 1,754 km-long Delhi-Chennai high-speed train corridor. This will be the world's second-largest bullet train line. China had agreed to conduct the study for free, during President Jinping's visit to India in September. The train will cover the distance in eight hours at 300 km/hr.
