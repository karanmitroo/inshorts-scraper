Markets regulator SEBI has said it is examining Fortis Healthcare's alleged regulatory lapses over fund transfers to some promoter-linked firms. This comes after reports that Fortis promoters, the Singh brothers, took ₹500 crore from the company without board approval about a year ago. However, Fortis had denied the claims and said that the brothers took "loans" amounting to ₹473 crore.
