The Delhi government has ordered restarting the registration of diesel cars with engine capacity over 2000cc on payment of 1% green cess on the ex-showroom price. This comes after the Supreme Court lifted the ban after the payment of the Environment Protection Charge. The amount would be used by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for its pollution mitigation efforts.
