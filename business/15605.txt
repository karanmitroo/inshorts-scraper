NITI Aayog's Vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has said that its success would be measured by the willingness of states to exploit the Aayog to resolve their problems. He added that the Aayog, which has replaced the Planning Commission, should evolve into a troubleshooting institution for states. Panagariya also stated that the body is preparing the procedure for working with states.
