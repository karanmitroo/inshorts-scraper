The SC has rejected SpiceJet's appeal and directed it to pay â‚¹579 crore over a dispute with previous owner Kalanithi Maran. Maran had sought issuance of stock warrants in SpiceJet as per an agreement that led to transfer of the airline's ownership to Ajay Singh. SpiceJet, however, said it couldn't issue warrants due to objections by the Bombay Stock Exchange.
