Ex-Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan has said that continuation of certain board members like Ravi Venkatesan and Roopa Kudva looks "untenable". This comes after Infosys filed a settlement plea with SEBI over its probe into former CFO Rajiv Bansal's severance pay. He said that Infosys' letter to stock exchanges blaming Co-founder Narayana Murthy for all of the board's lapses was "unprecedented".
