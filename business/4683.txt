JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who was scrutinised for his ties to President Donald Trump, said, “He is the President of the United States, he is the pilot flying the airplane." "I’d try to help any President of the US because I’m a patriot," Dimon stated. "That doesn't mean I agree with every policy he is trying to implement," he added.
