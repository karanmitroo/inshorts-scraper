Online shopping company Flipkart on Tuesday withdrew from the Airtel Zero platform, which provides access to certain apps and websites free of cost. Earlier, Flipkart CEO Sachin Bansal had supported Airtel Zero platform. Flipkart's decision came following a large scale backlash against the company on social media and low rating of its app by users.
