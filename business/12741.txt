India's Commerce Ministry on Friday announced a minimum import price across different grades of steel in a bid to control the surge of cheap imports and stabilise local industries. The duty ranges from $341 to $752 per tonne of steel and will be valid for six months, the government said. This reportedly is the first such restriction in 15 years.
