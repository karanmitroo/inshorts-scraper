In an attempt to protect local mills from cheaper imports, India has imposed an anti-dumping duty of $474-557 per tonne on the import of hot-rolled steel products from 6 nations, including China and South Korea. The government had concluded that the six countries exported goods "below normal value". The duty will be in effect for six months until February 2017.
