China's yuan on Monday slumped against the dollar to reach a new 5-1/2 year low for the second consecutive day of trading. The yuan hit 6.6642, the lowest since December 2010 due to extended dollar buying in the market and amid concerns of the People's Bank of China tolerating further depreciation of the currency, analysts said.
