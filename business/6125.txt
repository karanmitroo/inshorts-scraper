Marico, which owns premium oil brand Saffola, has said that Baba Ramdev-promoted Patanjali Ayurved's expansion into the edible oil business will not affect the company "at all". Saffola's innovation came from “the way we have positioned the brand over the years”, Chairman Harsh Mariwala said. His statement comes after Patanjali earlier announced an agreement with edible oil maker Ruchi Soya.
