Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said that a complete overhaul of GST rates is now required to reduce the burden on small and medium businesses. "Wherever we find there is a big burden on small and medium businesses and on common man, we have to bring them down," he said. GST will take about a year to stabilise, he added.
