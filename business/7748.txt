Tata Sons interim Chairman Ratan Tata on Tuesday hailed the government’s move to demonetise high-value currency notes as a bold act, saying it will eliminate black money and corruption. The move "deserves our support", he tweeted. Notably, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership has predicted that the move to demonetise notes will uncover up to ₹4.6 lakh crore in black money.
