Airtel has filed an affidavit with the telecom appellate tribunal, accusing the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of acting as a "mute spectator" to Reliance Jioâ€™s move to extend free services. In an earlier affidavit, Airtel had said, "Free services being offered by the said TSP (Jio)...have been introduced solely to drive out competition rather than encourage it."
