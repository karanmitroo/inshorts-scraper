US immigration authorities on Thursday announced that they have received more H-1B visa applications than the Congress-mandated cap of 65,000 for people hired abroad, in the first five days. The visas will be allotted based on a computerised lottery. The authorities will also issue 20,000 visas to foreigners enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects in US universities.
