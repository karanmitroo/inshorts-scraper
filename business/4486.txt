A luxury hotel in the UAE has employed eight cats to help its employees beat work-related stress, a media report has said. The Abu Dhabi-based Jannah Hotels and Resorts said the felines were recruited as part of its "office cat" policy to assist employees in unwinding and increasing productivity. Further, guests visiting the hotels can also play with the cats.
