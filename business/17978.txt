As many as 16000 engineers will be hired next year by the India's second largest software services firm Infosys, said the company's chairman NR Narayana Murthy. Since the demand for the outsourcing services is improving in the US and European markets, which account for over 80% revenues of the Indian IT sector, hiring is expected to be better.
