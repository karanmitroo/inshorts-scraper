Singapore's government has decided to cut the annual growth rate for cars and motorcycles to 0% from the current 0.25% starting from February 2018. The government cited the city-state's land constraints and its commitment to improving public transport system as the reason to limit the number of cars. The limit on vehicle growth rate will be reviewed again in 2020.
