BSEâ€™s chief Ashish Chauhan has said the market capitalisation of Indian markets can grow over ten times in the next 10-15 years to surpass $10 trillion level, the PTI reported on Sunday. Indian markets, which currently have market capitalisation around $1.6 trillion, can reach the level by increasing investor base, and raising investments in different areas, Chauhan said.
