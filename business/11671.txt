Liquor baron Vijay Mallya in a recent interview has said that the banks “are not getting any money” by getting his passport revoked or getting him arrested. Mallya said he has no plans to leave the United Kingdom as he is more than happy to stay safe there. The External Affairs Ministry had recently requested the UK to deport Mallya.
