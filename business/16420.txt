The Delhi High Court Friday asked Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd, which provides internet under MTS, to bring their "equipment" Monday for testing their claims of providing high speeds. MTS claims to provide speed up to 9.8 Mbps. The court orders came after it felt that an advertising body was "right" in holding Sistema's commercial about providing such speeds as "misleading".
