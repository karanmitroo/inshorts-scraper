Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has said Air India's debt could be 40% higher than the previously estimated ₹50,000 crore. "I won't be surprised if the total debt reaches ₹70,000 crore. Since people are looking at the books carefully, they may find more," the minister said. He added that a foreign player has shown interest in buying 49% stake.
