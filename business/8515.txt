According to a regulatory filing by Time Warner on Monday, CEO Jeff Bewkes could receive a $32 million payout if AT&T completes its $85 billion acquisition of the company. The filing showed that Bewkes, who has been Time Warner's CEO for over eight years, could earn twice the amount of long-term incentives indicated by the company in April.
