The central government on Wednesday appointed Kerala's Finance Minister KM Mani as the chairman of empowered committee of state finance ministers on goods and services tax (GST). Notably, Mani has recently been in controversy due to corruption allegations. GST, which will replace all indirect taxes levied on goods and services, is scheduled to be implemented from April 1, 2016.
