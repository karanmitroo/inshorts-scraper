Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Monday said if state-run carrier Air India "is left like what it is, it is bound to die". Stating that Air India is a "nice" airline, Raju added, "[W]e want Air India to survive, we don't mind where it is, who runs it. As long as it serves the Indian people...we are happy."
