Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the CBI should be questioning him, instead of harassing his son Karti, in the Aircel-Maxis case. He also accused CBI of spreading misinformation. Karti, who was summoned by CBI in connection with the deal, has refused to appear, saying a special court had discharged all the accused in the matter.
