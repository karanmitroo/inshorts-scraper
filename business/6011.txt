Beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya has said, "I am safe in this country under UK laws, until proven otherwise." He further said that Indian authorities had no grounds to extradite him from the UK and that he would not be leaving. Mallya had earlier dismissed the charges against him, saying that "not one rupee was misused".
