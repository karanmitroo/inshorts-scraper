Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das has tweeted that the government’s Sovereign Gold Bond scheme has attracted “63,000 applications for 917 kg" of gold "amounting to ₹246 crore”. The bonds would be allotted on November 30. Meanwhile, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said that the Gold Monetisation scheme, which has garnered only 400 grams of physical gold, would “need some fine tuning”.
