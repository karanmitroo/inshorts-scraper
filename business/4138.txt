Budget carrier SpiceJet's stock has surged 124% this year, making it the worldâ€™s best-performing airline stock, according to Bloomberg. The stock has gained over 800% since SpiceJet was forced to ground its entire fleet over inability to pay $2.2 million in fuel bills in 2014. The rise has been attributed to Co-founder Ajay Singh injecting capital and cutting loss-making routes.
