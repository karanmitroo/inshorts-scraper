Reliance Jio and Paytm have apologised for using PM Narendra Modi's picture in their advertisements without permission. The government had sent notices to the companies under the Emblems and Names Act, which bars the use of the Prime Minister's name and picture for commercial purposes. In the ads, Paytm applauded demonetisation, while Jio claimed it furthered the 'Digital India' move.
