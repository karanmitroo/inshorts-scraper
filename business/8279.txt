Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries is going to contest the $1.55 billion penalty imposed by the government on the company and its partners for selling gas belonging to state-run ONGC, a statement read. The government's claim is not sustainable, Reliance said. The penalty is in regard of reports that claimed natural gas worth ₹11,000 crore migrated to RIL from ONGC’s fields.
