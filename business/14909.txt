Wholesale onion prices have increased by 70% in one month at the Lasalgoan market in Maharashtra. Hitting its highest for July since 1995, the value soared after the government increased its minimum export price due to crop damage across major states. Onions are being sold at Rs 25.50 per kilogram at Lasalgaon against Rs 15 per kilogram last month.
