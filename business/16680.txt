Aided by mobile ads, Facebook's revenue in the three months ended Sept 30 totaled $3.2 billion, up 59 per cent from $2.02 billion in the year-ago period. The profit comes even as the company revealed deep losses in its recently acquired WhatsApp business. WhatsApp lost $232.5 million in the first six months of 2014.
