Investment banks earned a record of nearly $104 billion in fees globally last year from advising companies on over $3.5 trillion worth of takeovers and mergers, according to Thomson Reuters. This is a 16% increase from 2016 and the highest-ever yearly total. Notably, it was also the fourth consecutive year that global dealmaking has exceeded $3 trillion in value.
