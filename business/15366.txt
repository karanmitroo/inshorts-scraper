Greece's ruling party claimed on Wednesday that it won't be able to make an IMF loan repayment due on June 5 unless it reaches a deal with its creditors by then. "If there is no deal by then that will address the current funding problem, they won't get any money," said Nikos Filis, spokesman for the ruling Syriza party.
