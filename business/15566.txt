Car sales rose by 4.99% in the financial year 2014-15 after falling for 2 consecutive years prior to it as low fuel prices lowered ownership costs for consumers. The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) declared sales of 18,76,017 units in FY15, a big growth compared to a decline of -4.65% and -6.69% in the previous two years.
