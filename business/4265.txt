Financial services major Barclays and four former executives, including the bank's ex-CEO John Varley, have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. The charges come at the end of a five-year investigation on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors, struck during the 2008 crisis. Notably, this marks the first time any senior bankers have faced charges for the crisis' events.
