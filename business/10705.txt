UK Business Secretary Sajid Javid on Friday held talks with Commerce & Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss an eventual separate bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This comes after the UK's decision to leave the European Union through which it negotiated its trade deals. Further, Javid said his discussion was "positive and constructive" and would 'strengthen' UK-India ties.
