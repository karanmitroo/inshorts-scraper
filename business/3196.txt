London police arrested Eric Bellquist, a partner with private equity group Hutton Collins Partners and former Lehman Brothers employee, on suspicion of pushing a woman under a bus while he was jogging. This followed a video showing a male jogger elbowing the female into the bus' path and running off. He returned and ignored the woman when she confronted him.
