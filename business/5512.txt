Congress leader Veerappa Moily said BJP delayed implementation of GST during the Congress-led UPA regime, which caused an estimated loss of ₹12 lakh crore to India. “Who is to make up for this loss?” Moily asked. “GST is a historic reform. Of course, GST must have been implemented under the Congress but couldn’t pass it due to Opposition,” Moily added.
