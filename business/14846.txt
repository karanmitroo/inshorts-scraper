Dublin's Circuit Criminal Court court sentenced 3 bankers of the Anglo Irish bank to 1.5-3 years in prison for conspiring to hide accounts and tax evasion on Friday, in the first sentencing after the country's financial crisis. The Anglo Irish bank, which became notorious for its 'casino-style' lending practices, drove the country's 'Celtic Tiger' boom which cost Ireland â‚¬30 billion.
