Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani has said he will be at Infosys "as long as required, not a day longer." Nilekani was brought back to the company in August last year, following the resignation of then CEO Vishal Sikka and ex-Chairman R Seshasayee after a boardroom tussle. Nilekani also said new CEO Salil Parekh had brought stability to the company.
