Gold on Saturday surged to five-week high by gaining Rs 280 to Rs 28,425-per-ten-grams in the national capital on increased buying by stockists and jewellers following RBI's fresh import norms. The RBI recently announced that 20% of gold imports must be used for exports. However, silver lacked necessary buying support and declined by Rs 120 to Rs 41,230-per-kg.
