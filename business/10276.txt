Spanish-made Talgo train today covered the Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani route in 12 hours and 7 minutes, hitting a maximum speed of 140 kmph. Talgo, which is being tested to cover the route in under 12 hours, was delayed by 7-8 minutes due to “unusual occurrences”, an official said. Talgo clocked a speed of 180 kmph on the Mathura-Palwal route in July.
