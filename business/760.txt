Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran on Monday said he won't talk about what Tata will do or not do with Air India on television. He further said the group will make large investments in steel and auto. In October last year, Chandrasekaran had said Tata Group is interested in Air India but will need more details on its disinvestment process.
