NITI Aayog's Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya on Thursday said a "wrong choice of words" can create big news. Panagariya's comment came over the remarks made by NITI Aayog member Bibek Debroy on taxing agricultural income. Debroy's remarks on the issue had prompted Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to issue a statement that government doesn't have any plans to tax agricultural income.
