Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges on Thursday announced that China will suspend the use of stock market circuit breakers from Friday after the breakers stopped trading twice this week owing to a sharp fall in the markets. The mechanism which was implemented on January 1 this year stops trading in major Chinese stock markets if stocks fall more than 7%.
