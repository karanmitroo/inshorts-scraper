German carmaker Volkswagen has severed ties with some Indian mica suppliers, following an investigation that reported deaths of at least seven children since June in mica mines. The children died while working in illegal, unregulated mines in Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, a Volkswagen official said. Notably, mica is used to make car paints and makeup.
