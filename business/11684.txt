The government has banned the import of dogs for breeding or any other commercial activity, as per a recent notification by the Director General of Foreign Trade. The notification, however, clarifies that import of dogs is allowed for defence and police forces, research by R&D organisations, and people getting pet dogs with relevant documents in the importerâ€™s name.
