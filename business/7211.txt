Cyrus Mistry-controlled firms have alleged that some friends and associates of Ratan Tata were bestowed powers to commit investment decisions on Tata Sons' behalf, while others were granted “extraordinary and undue favours”. A petition has sought an audit of transactions in which these people were allegedly involved. The petition further claimed Mistry paid a price for going after these people.
