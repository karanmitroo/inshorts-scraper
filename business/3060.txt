Automaker Ford has agreed to pay around $10.2 million to settle Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) claims that female and African-American employees were harassed at two Chicago facilities. It also claimed Ford retaliated when they complained about such discrimination. The company said it chose to voluntarily resolve this issue without any admission of liability with the EEOC.
