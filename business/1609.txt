Kishore Biyani-led Future Group's Brand Factory outlets will be charging customers ₹100-250 to enter their stores during the five-day promotional campaign in November. "It is to encourage serious shoppers, and bring exclusivity to their shopping experience," said Biyani about the move. Last year, the company had organised a similar three-day shopping event making ₹115 crore in sales.
