Markets regulator SEBI will seek a report from the Tata Group to look into possible violation of corporate governance and listing norms referred to by Cyrus Mistry. "We are taking note of each and every development and will act immediately if there is any hint of possible violation", an official said. This comes after Tata sons removed Mistry as Chairman.
