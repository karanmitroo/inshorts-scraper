Aviation regulator DGCA has suspended the license of a SpiceJet pilot for allegedly allowing an air hostess to sit in the cockpit for a "considerable time". The pilot, whose services with the airline were terminated, also allegedly forced the co-pilot to sit out during the flight. Reportedly, the DGCA action against the pilot restricts him from flying temporarily.
