The benchmark Sensex on Monday dipped 266.67 points to settle at 24,188.37 points, while, the broader Nifty fell 86.80 points to close at 7,351.00 points. Analysts attributed the slump to concerns over the global economy, caused due to crude oil prices slipping to its lowest level since 2003 and India's merchandise exports falling for the 13th-straight month.
