Infosys Founder Narayana Murthy on Tuesday expressed disappointment that none of the questions raised by him on "poor governance" had been answered by the company's board with transparency. He asserted that the core question still remained on "how and why the Infosys board approved an unusual and unprecedented severance payment agreement of 1000%" to former CFO Rajiv Bansal.
