The Indian Railways has given senior citizens the option of not availing concession on the purchase of reserved class train tickets. Currently, male passengers aged above 60 years and female passengers over 58 years automatically get a concession upon filling age-related information in the form for reserving tickets. The move is reportedly aimed at reducing the subsidy burden on Railways.
