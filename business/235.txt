PNB fraud accused Arjun Patil's wife Sujata has said she would beat Nirav Modi with a slipper if he came to India. The CBI alleged that Patil, who was a senior executive at Nirav's Firestar Group, had drafted documents used to apply for fake Letters of Undertaking (LoUs). Sujata said her husband was only doing paperwork like some people there.
