The RBI on Thursday announced that old ₹500 notes will not be accepted at petrol pumps, toll plazas or for booking air tickets from December 2 midnight. However, the notes can still be used to purchase LPG cylinders, railway tickets and pay government hospital and utility bills. Pre-paid mobile recharge up to ₹500 in old notes is also acceptable.
