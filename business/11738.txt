According to UK's Department of Transport, nearly 97% of all modern diesel cars emit more toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution on the road than the official limit. The report claimed that there was a "vast difference" in the emissions measured in the laboratory than under normal driving conditions. Notably, most models which complied with the standards were Volkswagen-made.
