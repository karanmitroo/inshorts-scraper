Residents of Supertech Livingston society in Ghaziabad on Sunday staged a protest against the builder for allegedly increasing the Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charge by over 40%. "Nobody discussed the new rates with us, we were just informed," said a resident. The residents also claimed that the increased charges are being deducted from prepaid electric meters.
