Demand for platinum jewellery shot up by 40-50% in Feb-March after the metal became cheaper than gold. Platinum is currently priced at around Rs. 26,300 per 10 grams while gold prices hover around Rs. 26,600 per 10 grams. The launch of a platinum collection named Evara by the Platinum Guild India also contributed to the rise in sales.
