Mercedes-Benz India CEO Ronald Folger has said that Mercedes cars are expensive in India because of high taxation. Folger's statement came in response to GST Council's recommendation to hike cess on luxury cars from 15% to 25%, along with 28% GST. He said the company was planning to expand in India but the hike in cess would make it difficult.
