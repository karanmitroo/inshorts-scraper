Nearly $30 million of funds stolen from Malaysia's scandal-hit 1MDB wealth fund were used to buy jewellery for Prime Minister Najib Razak's wife Rosmah Mansor, according to filings by the US Justice Department. Notably, a total of $4.5 billion has been misappropriated from 1MDB, which was set up by Razak in 2009 to promote economic development.
