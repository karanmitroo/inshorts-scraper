The biggest bank in the Nordic region, Nordea, has informed all its employees on Monday that they will not be allowed to trade in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from February 28. The bank said the decision was taken due to the "unregulated nature" of the market. However, employees who already own cryptocurrencies are permitted to keep existing holdings.
