Samsung's net income went down by 39% this quarter, as Apple launched bigger-screened phones. Profits plunged from approximately $7 billion last year to $4.35 billion, even though the Korean firm sold a larger number of phones. These phones were reportedly middle-ranged ones and so didn't bring much profit. Samsung is expecting a better scenario next quarter with S6 and S6Edge.
