Tata Sons, Ratan Tata and Tata Trust on Tuesday filed four caveats against former Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry in all courts, including the National Company Law Tribunal. A caveat is a notice filed to ensure that the court doesn't take certain actions without informing the person who gave the notice. Mistry, reportedly, has not filed any caveats against Tata.
