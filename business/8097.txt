The US Federal Trade Commission has said that it has been investigating whether Volkswagen destroyed documents related to the emissions cheating scandal. The German automaker had admitted in September 2015 that it installed a secret software in its diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests. Volkswagen has agreed to spend up to $16.5 billion to date, over the scandal.
