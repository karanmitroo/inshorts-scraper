The Indian government is considering a proposal to introduce its own cryptocurrency 'Lakshmi' similar to Bitcoin, according to reports. The proposal was reportedly discussed by a committee of government officials who found the idea of running blockchain for financial services useful. Notably, if the proposal is carried out, the cryptocurrency will fall in the domain of the RBI.
