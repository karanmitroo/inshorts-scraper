Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an interview, “We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard.' If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.” Referring to Apple’s electric car project, he added, “[T]he car is the next logical thing to offer a significant innovation. A new pencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough.”
