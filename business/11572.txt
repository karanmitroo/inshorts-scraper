India and Iran reached an agreement for the former to pay Iran $6.4 billion in pending oil payments using European banks, India's Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. Oil buyers could not pay Iran owing to the sanctions, which were recently lifted. Indian refiners were holding 55% of the payments pending to Iran and were depositing 45% with India's UCO bank.
