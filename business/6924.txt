Reuters has prepared a chart which shows the share price performance for companies after US President-elect Donald Trump tweeted about them. In December, Trump tweeted to cancel a plane order from Boeing, following which its shares fell 1.4% before recovering. Trump had also criticised Lockheed Martin's F-35 programme, following which the company's market value dropped by over $3 billion.
