A Gurugram court has ordered filing of FIRs against PVR Cinemas and its promoters on a petition that accused them of fraud. Real estate firm Elan alleged that PVR entered into an agreement with Elan to take a multiplex space on lease and later terminated the agreement without a convincing reason. PVR said the allegations were "incorrect and baseless".
