The Home Ministry said the Commerce Ministry's proposal to allow visa-free travel to visitors from Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa cannot be cleared amid security concerns over Chinese nationals. Offering the facility to other nations while denying China is not possible, it said. Moreover, rejections for business visitors are rare and the proposal "lacks merit", it added.
