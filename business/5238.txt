US President Donald Trump has called the United Airlines incident, wherein a passenger was dragged off a flight by police officers, as 'horrible'. He has further called on airlines to increase the amount they offer to passengers to give up their seats on overbooked flights. "[T]o just randomly say 'You're getting off the plane', that was terrible," Trump stated.
