Eric Bellquist, a partner at Hutton Collins and former Lehman Brothers employee, has been dismissed as the jogger who pushed a woman into a bus' path in London. Bellquist, who was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, is no longer part of the investigation. Bellquist was out of the country when the assault occurred, his lawyer said.
