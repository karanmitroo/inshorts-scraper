Protesting dealers of General Motors have said that over 15,000 people could lose jobs following the automaker's move to stop selling cars in India, and requested government intervention. Demanding adequate compensation, the dealers termed GM's exit as "clearly thought out conspiracy". They also alleged that GM kept the dealers "in the dark" of its decision to close operations in India.
