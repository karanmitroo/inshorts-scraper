The government on Monday changed the norms for Public Provident Fund (PPF) deposits, allowing the subscribers of the scheme to prematurely close their accounts and withdraw the complete amount after five years. However, the withdrawal will be allowed for expenditure towards higher education or medical treatment. Currently, the lock-in period for complete withdrawal from PPF accounts is 15 years.
