On the back of better-than-expected revenue and profit for the September quarter, Alphabet on Thursday said its board had approved a stock buyback of up to $5.09 billion of its Class C shares. This is the company's first stock buyback and the latest step in its transition into a new financial and management structure wherein Alphabet is Google's holding company.
