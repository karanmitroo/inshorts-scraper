The Centre on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that Aadhaar and mobile number must be linked by February 6, 2018. The Centre said it was the SC which had mandated Aadhaar-mobile number linking on February 6, giving a window of one year. It added that the deadline cannot be modified by the government unilaterally, as the SC had fixed it.
