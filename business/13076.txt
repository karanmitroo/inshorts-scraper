The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty on Friday dropped to their respective 19-month lows. While the Sensex plunged by 317.93 points to close at 24,455.04, the Nifty lost 99.00 points to settle at 7,437.80. Analysts attributed the latest sell-off to negative cues from Asian markets and low corporate earnings amid the continued slump in crude oil prices.
