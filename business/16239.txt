Aiming to tap into the growing demand in smaller cities, e-commerce giant Flipkart plans to establish pickup or collection centres in such cities, having a population of up to 50,000. Under this model, buyers can collect their package from the collection centres. Starting April, the company could open up to 270 such centres by the end of March 2017.
