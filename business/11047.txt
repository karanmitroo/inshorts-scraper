In an effort to maintain local supplies, the government is planning to introduce a 25% tax on sugar exports. Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the levy is aimed at curbing the country's exports and would help keep local prices under control. Further, sugar output in the country is set to decline due to a drought in major growing regions.
