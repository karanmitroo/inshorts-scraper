Volkswagen and the US Justice Department are nearing an agreement that would require the automaker to pay a penalty of more than $3 billion to resolve its diesel emissions scandal, according to reports. Volkswagen had previously agreed to pay up to $17.5 billion to resolve claims by US owners, regulators, and dealers and admitted it misled authorities for years.
