The Delhi High Court on Monday asked how the Centre could ban the manufacture of drugs without cancelling the licence of the manufacturers, in connection with the recent ban on 344 combination drugs. In response, the Additional Solicitor General representing the government said that irrespective of licence, if a drug "has no therapeutic justification, then it has to be banned".
