Oil was struck for the first time in Saudi Arabia on March 3, 1938, by an American-owned oil company. The oil well, located in Dhahran, was later identified as the largest source of petroleum in the world. The discovery transformed Saudi Arabia's economy, making it the largest producer and exporter of oil in the world.
