Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday took to Twitter to reveal why American electric carmaker Tesla was formed. Musk said Tesla was started after General Motors recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 against their will. Tesla was not formed to make money, as its founders thought there was a "90% probability of losing it all," he added.
