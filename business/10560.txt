International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde will face criminal trial for alleged negligence that resulted in a government payout of €405 million to tycoon Bernard Tapie, one of France's highest appeals court ruled on Friday. Lagarde in 2008, as the then French Finance Minister, approved an out-of-court arbitration in the dispute between former state-owned bank Crédit Lyonnais and Tapie.
