Automakers Nissan, BMW of North America, and Ford have accused airbag manufacturer Takata of fraud in a lawsuit seeking to force it to cover losses from its faulty inflators. The automakers claimed Takata withheld information about airbag defects, which caused at least 17 deaths worldwide. Earlier, Takata pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a $1 billion settlement with US prosecutors.
