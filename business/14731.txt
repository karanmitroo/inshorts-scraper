Official data on Monday showed that Japan's economy shrunk by 0.4 percent in the second quarter. The decrease was attributed to low exports and weak domestic consumption. “The sharp plunge from the previous quarter’s surprise growth was partly due to disappointing demand for Japanese products in the US, Chinese and other resource-exporting markets,” SMBC Nikko Securities said in a commentary.
