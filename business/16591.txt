Owing to more buying by jewellers and retailers, gold made the highest jump since June 20, on Saturday. The yellow metal became Rs 650 costlier, to close at Rs 26,450 per 10 grams in the national capital. Silver also recovered by increasing by Rs 650 to reach Rs 35,550 per kg, mainly due to increased offtake by industrial units.
