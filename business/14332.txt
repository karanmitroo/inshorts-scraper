IMF has estimated India's economic growth at 7.3% this year, against its previous estimate of 7.5%. It further forecasts India's growth at 7.7% by 2020, which would be highest among the top economies. "With China gradually transitioning into an environment of lower growth, India could durably occupy the top growth spot among large emerging markets", IMF said.
