NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya on Sunday said that the claims of jobless growth are bit bogus and cannot be logically correct. "I have never heard about any country where growth of 7 to 8 per cent is happening without new investment or labour," he said. He further said NITI Aayog is promoting coastal zones to attract export-oriented firms.
