Yes Bank sold shares worth ₹778 crore to invoke 3.02% stake in United Breweries, which was pledged by McDowell Holdings. The bank said it was "to secure loans given to group companies". This comes after SBI and a consortium of banks declared Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines and its majority stakeholder United Breweries 'wilful defaulters' in a ₹7,000 crore loan.
