Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved has withdrawn its trademark applications for soap brand Ojas after Charak Pharma alleged the brand is 'deceptively' similar to its herbal tablets brand name Ojus. Charak had filed a case in the Bombay High Court. While Patanjali said it discontinued products under Ojas in 2014, goods under the brand can reportedly be found on e-commerce websites.
