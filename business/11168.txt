The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Wednesday said it will write to the government to give it powers to levy penalties on telecom operators. This comes after the Supreme Court, on May 11, struck down the TRAI order to penalise the operators for call drops. Giving TRAI punitive powers would need an amendment in the TRAI Act.
