Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar has said that honest borrowers will find it easier to get loans from public sector banks (PSBs) following the reforms being undertaken. The government on Wednesday announced it would infuse ₹88,139 crore as capital into 20 PSBs. PSBs have been reeling under bad loans, which total around ₹8 trillion and have hampered lending, impacting growth.
