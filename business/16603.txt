Automobile company Mahindra and Mahindra plans to launch three new vehicles next year, including two compact SUVs to strengthen its domestic market position. "We were slow on launches in 2013 and 2104. Now we are back with new launches. All the three would come on completely new platforms," Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka said.
