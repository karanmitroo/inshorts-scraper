Infosys is buying automation technology company Panaya Inc at an enterprise value of about $200 million. This is Infosys' second largest acquisition after it bought Zurich-based Lodestone for $350 million in September 2012. The deal is expected to close before March 31. The Panaya's acquisition is a key step in renewing and differentiating company's service lines, CEO Vishal Sikka said.
