The RBI will shortly issue banknotes of Rs 1000 denomination in the Mahatma Gandhi series (2005) bearing the signature of governor Raghuram Rajan. Design of these notes will be similar in all respects to the Rs 1000 Banknotes in Mahatma Gandhi Series (2005) issued earlier. The year of printing 2014 would be on the reverse of the banknote, RBI added.
