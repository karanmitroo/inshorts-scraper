India is likely to see only a "small" impact if the US Federal Reserve decides to hike interest rates, according to noted Harvard University economist Gita Gopinath. She attributed this to India's good performance in managing the fiscal and monetary policy, among others. She further added that the Fed hike will be small and can be around 25 basis points.
