The world's most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed $9,000 on Sunday to hit a fresh all-time high. The price of Bitcoin has jumped more than 800% this year so far amid increasing interest from institutional investors. The latest rise has been attributed to increased investor interest around the US Thanksgiving holiday and Black Friday shopping.
