The government will soon categorise security guards as 'skilled' workers and armed security guards and supervisors as 'highly skilled' workers. This will entitle them to a minimum monthly wage of ₹15,000 and ₹25,000 respectively, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said. This will benefit over 50 lakh private security personnel, and provide social cover to over 2.5 crore family members, he added.
