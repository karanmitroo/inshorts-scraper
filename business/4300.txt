In a meeting with government officials, Idea said four big operators, namely Airtel, Idea, Vodafone and Reliance Communications, cumulatively lost ₹8,200 crore of revenue in the second half of last fiscal over the first half. This was due to free offerings by Reliance Jio, which hit industry's growth. Further, Airtel alleged Jio had adopted “predatory pricing” to win market share.
