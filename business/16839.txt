Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will investigate the circumstances of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approval given by former finance minister P Chidambaram in the Aircel-Maxis deal in 2006. Chidambaram said on Friday that there was no violation of rules in the grant of FIPB approval, and that the case required only the approval of the Finance Minister.
