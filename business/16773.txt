A fresh and perhaps the final batch of HMT watches has arrived in the showrooms in Bangalore. The company has increased the price of these watches by 100%. According to sources, production of mechanical watches was suspended because of lack of manpower and capital. However, a few bulk orders recently made the company start manufacture of these watches.
