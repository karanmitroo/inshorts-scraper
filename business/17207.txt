K Murali Krishna, head of Infosysâ€™s computers and communications division, has quit the company; the 13th senior leader to do so, and the first one after announcement of the new CEO Vishal Sikka. Incidentally, Krishna was one of the half-dozen SVPs who was not promoted earlier this month, after Infosys elevated 12 senior VPs to the role of executive VP.
