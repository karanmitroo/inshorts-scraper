Former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli's lawyer has said Shkreli's comments offering $5,000 (â‚¹3.2 lakh) to anyone who would deliver him Hillary Clinton's hair was "intended as political satire". Shkreli said it was "never intended to cause alarm or promote any act of violence". Shkreli, a convicted felon, requested a US District Judge to not revoke his bail status.
