In a letter to his employees, fraud-accused Gitanjali Gems owner Mehul Choksi said they should look for other "career opportunities" as he cannot pay salaries anymore. He said this was because of the seizure of various bank accounts and other properties by investigating agencies. "I will face my destiny...have done nothing wrong and ultimately the truth shall prevail," Choksi added.
