An Air India spokesperson has said that there is "no delay in salary transaction" to employees, adding there was nothing "abnormal". He further said the payments were made on Friday. Reportedly, some officials and union members had said that Air India had failed to pay salaries for July to its employees within the usual time frame due to "cash deficit".
