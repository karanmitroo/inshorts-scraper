United Airlines has denied that flight attendants told a female passenger to urinate in a cup. "At no point was Ms. Harper told to use the cups instead of the lavatory," the airline said. The passenger had claimed she had already gotten up to use the restroom when the plane hit turbulence, and she was asked to return.
