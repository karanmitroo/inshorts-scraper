To make the budget, Finance Ministry collects receipts and expenditure information from various departments, holds discussions with industry bodies, and prepares revised estimates. The process takes place in complete secrecy with scrutiny by the Intelligence Bureau and the budget is printed at the North Block in Delhi. Officials are kept in isolation for over a week before the presentation.
