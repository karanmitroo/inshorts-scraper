The Delhi High Court has set aside an interim injunction order against biscuit maker Britannia, thereby allowing the company to manufacture and sell its digestive biscuits under the NutriChoice Zero brand. Britannia was involved in a copyright infringement case with ITC that claimed the packaging of the biscuits was a copy of ITC's Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuits.
