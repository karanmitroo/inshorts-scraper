The Nikkei India's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in February remained unchanged from its four-month high of 51.1 in January, as price cutting increased both domestic and international demand. Further, the sub-index for new orders rose to a five-month high of 52.3 from 51.7. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 signals contraction.
