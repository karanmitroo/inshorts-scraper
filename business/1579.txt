A federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay $247 million to six patients over defective hip implant devices. Six New York residents implanted with the devices said they experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries. The jury said devices were defective and companies failed to warn consumers about the risks.
