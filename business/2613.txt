Starting October 1, PNB customers will be charged â‚¹10 per transaction beyond a limit of five times a month, even if a PNB cardholder makes the transaction from PNB ATM. The charges apply for cash withdrawal and issuance of mini-statement. Currently, PNB account holders can make any number of transactions in a month from PNB ATMs without attracting any charge.
