Saudi Arabia's Labour Ministry issued an order on Thursday to restrict employment in shopping malls only to Saudi nationals. Currently, Saudi's retail sector employs 15 lakh workers, of whom only 3 lakh are Saudis. In its plan to create jobs for Saudi nationals, the kingdom has been closing employment sectors to foreigners, who account for a third of its population.
