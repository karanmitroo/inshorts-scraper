India's sixth-largest telecom operator Aircel on Wednesday filed for bankruptcy at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) claiming that it has a debt of â‚¹15,500 crore. This comes after the Ananda Krishnan-owned Malaysian parent Maxis Communications refused to infuse more funds into Aircel. Notably, Aircel's proposed merger with Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications had failed last year.
