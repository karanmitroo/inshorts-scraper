Tech firm Google, automaker Ford Motors, taxi-hailing service Uber, Sweden's Volvo Cars and US-based ride-sharing service Lyft have said they are forming a coalition to push for federal action to help speed self-driving cars' entry into the market. The group will "work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realise the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles", they said.
