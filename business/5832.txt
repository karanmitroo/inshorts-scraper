An IndiGo pilot was caught after making a false flight delay announcement and attributing it to the Air Traffic Controller, to “cover up” the absence of his co-pilot. The pilot claimed that the ATC was not clearing the aircraft for departure. However, an ATC, who was on the plane, met the pilot and found the co-pilot wasn't in his seat.
