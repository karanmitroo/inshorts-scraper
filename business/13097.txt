The government on Wednesday approved a new crop insurance scheme which would replace the existing ones â€“ National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and Modified NAIS. The move would ensure that farmers pay less premium and get early claims for the full sum insured. The new scheme will be implemented from the Kharif season this year.
