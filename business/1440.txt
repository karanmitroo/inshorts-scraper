The RBI has asked cooperative societies not to use the word 'Bank' in their names as it violates the Banking Regulation Act. The central bank said that such societies have neither been issued any licence nor are they authorised by the RBI to undertake banking business. It has advised the public to exercise caution before dealing with such cooperative societies.
