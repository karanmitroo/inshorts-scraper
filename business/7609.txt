A former Citigroup financial adviser has filed a lawsuit accusing the bank of running a "boys' club" that favoured men over women. The former adviser claimed that she was reduced to a "glorified secretary" and was fired for complaining about her manager who demanded inside information. Further, she alleged that Citigroup forced her to apologise for requesting equal treatment.
