Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said he himself had to come back to India to exchange demonetised currency as he had no clue about the demonetisation date. Rajan said he'd taken Indian currency to US and had to come back to change that into valid currency. Rajan further felt that the short-term cost of note ban would outweigh long-term gains.
