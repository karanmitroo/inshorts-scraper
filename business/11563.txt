ICICI Bank on Thursday became the first financial institution in the country to tie up with the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Grouping-promoted New Development Bank (NDB). The two banks signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to consider each other as “preferred” partners for collaboration in bond issuances, co-financing, treasury management and human resources.
