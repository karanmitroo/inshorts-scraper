Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) infused a gross amount of ₹53,296 crore into equity markets between January 1-22, while they pulled out ₹63,259 crore during the same period, resulting in a net outflow of ₹9,963 crore. Analysts attributed the outflow to slumping oil prices, weak December quarter results, widening of trade deficit in December, concerns over Chinese economy and depreciating rupee.
