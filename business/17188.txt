BSE sensex and NSE nifty both hit record high levels in early trades on Wednesday on optimism that the forthcoming Budget on July 10 will aim at fiscal consolidation. Sensex hit 25,743 while nifty hit 7,701, each a few points above their earlier life highs hit about three weeks ago. Buying by FIIs also helped the rally, dealers said.
