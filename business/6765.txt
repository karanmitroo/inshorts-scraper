The Finance Ministry on Saturday stated that the government fully respects the independence and autonomy of the Reserve Bank of India. "Consultations mandated by law or as evolved by practice should not be taken as infringement of autonomy," the Ministry stated. The statement comes amid reports that some unions have alleged infringement of the autonomy of the RBI.
