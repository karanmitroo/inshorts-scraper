Hours after taxi service Uber was banned in Delhi on Tuesday, Thailand transport authorities ordered the company to stop providing services. Calling the service illegal, the authorities said drivers picking up fare-paying passengers via Uber were neither registered nor insured to drive commercial vehicles. The credit-card payment system did not comply with regulations, the authorities added.
