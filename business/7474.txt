Fast food chain McDonald’s is going to revamp its McCafé brand next year in order to challenge coffee majors Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. The company first launched the coffee brand eight years ago and it now generates about $4 billion annually. The new McCafé campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing, McDonald’s said.
