BlackBerry has started a month-long programme allowing users to trade older BlackBerry mobiles for the newest model Z10, which costs around Rs 37,500 to Rs 42,490, for hefty discounts of up to Rs 11,000. The scheme to push Z10 sales is also valid for users of other branded smartphones but the discount will be at retailer's discretion.
