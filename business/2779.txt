Russia has reportedly started its first-ever criminal case against Bitcoin sales after it arrested three businessmen for illegally trading in around $9 million worth of Bitcoin. They illegally cashed the millions in Bitcoin, and are being brought up on charges of "illegal banking". The transactions originated from 300 bank cards and sim cards used to store Bitcoin, authorities said.
