Infosys, in a press release on Friday, said the board currently has no intention of asking Co-founder Narayana Murthy to play a formal role in governance of the organisation. Infosys said the board has a commitment to remain independent and pursue a chosen strategy. Notably, the company blamed Murthy's "continuous assault" as the reason behind Vishal Sikka's resignation as CEO.
