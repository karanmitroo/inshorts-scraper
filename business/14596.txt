With an aim to get small and medium businesses (SMBs) registered on the recently launched Shopo platform, e-commerce major Snapdeal will invest $100 million (approximately Rs 665 crores) in the venture. The mobile-only Shopo platform was launched in July and helps bring together SMBs that cannot register on bigger e-commerce platforms. The platform already has 20,000 shops onboard.
