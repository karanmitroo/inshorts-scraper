Japan's Honda Motor Co is planning to manufacture higher-powered bikes in the range of 650cc-1000cc plus in India. The company is currently the second largest 2-wheeler maker in India, ahead of home grown Bajaj Auto and TVS. These bikes, which are generally priced above Rs 5 lakh, will be made locally to avoid high import duties.
