Following a father's complaint that his nine-year-old daughter refused to drink Dabur's Real juice, as the packaging said it was meant for "him", the government took up the issue with the manufacturer. Dabur on Wednesday said it will amend the packaging to avoid misunderstanding. Notably, the packaging said, "Something that is good for your child should also make him smile."
