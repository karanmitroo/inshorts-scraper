The Finance Ministry has said in a statement that trading in Virtual Currencies (VCs) like Bitcoin can result in "permanent loss of money", as these currencies lack government authorisation. It also compared VCs to "ponzi schemes". "The VCs don't have any intrinsic value and are not backed by any kind of assets," the ministry said.
