RBI governor Raghuram Rajan's fresh measures to rescue rupee will continue this week as well, say analysts. Rajan's policy of helping banks get funds at cheaper rate, doubling the re-booking amount on cancelled exports and permitting the investment of 400% of domestic corporate's networth in foreign market have shown positive effects on rupee, helping it trade in the 63-65.50 range.
