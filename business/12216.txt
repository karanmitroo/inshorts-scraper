Indian drug manufacturers' association President SV Veerramani on Friday said the government decision to ban 344 drug combinations is "arbitrary and unfair". The products worth â‚¹5,000 crore have been banned for manufacture, distribution and sale with immediate effect causing hardship to manufacturers and patients, he added. He also said there was no proper discussion with industry before the ban.
