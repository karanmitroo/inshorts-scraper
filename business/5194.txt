The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based annual inflation rate in March eased to 5.7%, against a three-year high of 6.55% in February, according to data released on Monday. This was attributed to a fall in the prices of pulses, potato, and onion. Further, a pick up in the circulation of new currency has helped revive consumer demand after demonetisation.
