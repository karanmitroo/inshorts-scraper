Cab aggregator firm Uber has decided to employ women drivers to boost customer confidence following a female traveler's allegation of molestation against the company's driver. Uber recently recruited 20 women cab drivers in Mumbai to ensure the safety of women traveling alone, especially at night. Other cab operators have also planned a similar move.
