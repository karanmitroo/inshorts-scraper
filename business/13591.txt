The South Korean government on Thursday slapped a fine worth $12.31 million on Volkswagen and ordered a recall of 125,522 cars after finding the car manufacturer guilty of manipulating a diesel emission device in cars with older engines. The nation has said it will continue to probe 30,000 other diesel cars in which evidence of emissions cheating was not found.
