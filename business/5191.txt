Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries has introduced a 12-week paid leave for 'commissioning' mothers who use surrogates to bear a child, as it adopted provisions of the new maternity law. Reliance has also extended adoption leave to 12 weeks from 28 days "for a woman/single father colleague who adopts a child less than three months of age".
