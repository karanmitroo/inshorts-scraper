The Supreme Court has sought a response from Essar Steel on a Gujarat government appeal alleging a “deliberate diversion” of natural gas to its sister firm, Essar Power, for electricity generation. Gujarat has claimed the company is liable to pay a purchase tax of ₹480 crore including penalties. Earlier, the Gujarat High Court had given the company a clean chit.
