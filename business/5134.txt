Japan's Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, during a speech in a US university, said its "airlines will not beat you". Japanese people endured an economic slump, stayed calm and "the sense of pride among workers is still intact", he stated. Notably, his statement comes following the incident of police officers dragging a passenger off a United Airlines flight.
