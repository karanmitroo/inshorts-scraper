In a recent event when Bajaj Auto's Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj was asked about a Bajaj-branded car launch, he said, "Cars are too big, too fast, they pollute, they congest and they kill all of us because they run over us". He added, "We are an anti-car company. We feel that people should either walk, cycle, use two-wheelers or three-wheelers".
