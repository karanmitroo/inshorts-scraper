Standard Chartered on Wednesday said pre-tax profit was up 93% to $1.9 billion in the first half of the year as it continues to rally after job cuts and restructuring. The company's underlying income rose 6% year-on-year to $7.2 billion. CEO Bill Winters described the performance as "encouraging" and said the bank was now leaner and more efficient.
