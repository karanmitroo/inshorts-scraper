Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has gathered around 5.2 crore subscribers as of December-end, and could hit 10 crore subscribers by March 2017, financial services major JPMorgan said. “Given the financial strength of Reliance Industries to back Jio, they could likely play the pricing game for longer," it added. Notably, Jio’s free services offer has been extended to March 2017.
