The Bharat Stage (BS) emission standards, introduced in 2000, were set up by the Centre to regulate air pollutants emitted by vehicles. Under the BS-III norms, regulations were put on vehicular pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter among others. BS-IV compliant vehicles cause nearly 50% less pollution than BS-III compliant ones.
