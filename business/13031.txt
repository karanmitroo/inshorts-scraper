An RBI-sponsored ‘Industrial Outlook Survey’ of the manufacturing sector released on Friday showed a “marginal increase in optimism” on the overall business situation for the January-March quarter of 2015-16. The survey, which evaluated responses from 1,337 manufacturing companies during October-December 2015, however, saw a marginal decline in optimism on employment and profit margins.
