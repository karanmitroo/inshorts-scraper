The AP Shah committee on Wednesday asked the government to claim compensation from Reliance Industries for “unjust benefit” it received from producing gas from state-run ONGC's Krishna-Godavari block. The panel accused the companies of concealing information about their fields being connected. In 2015, a report said, natural gas worth about ₹11,000 crore migrated to RIL fields from ONGC’s fields.
