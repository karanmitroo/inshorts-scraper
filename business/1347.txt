The RBI has kept the repo rate, the rate at which banks borrow from RBI, unchanged at 6% for the second time in a row during its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review on Wednesday. This comes after retail inflation in October rose to a 7-month high of 3.58%. The RBI last cut the rate by 25 basis points in August.
