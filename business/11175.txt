Forbes has lowered the estimated net worth of Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes, who topped the Forbes list of 'Americaâ€™s Richest Self-Made Women' last year, from $4.5 billion to nothing. Forbes said the controversy-ridden company is actually worth $800 million as opposed to $9 billion. Holmes' 50% stake would reportedly be worth nothing because investors would be paid back first.
