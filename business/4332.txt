Noted commodities trader and Chairman of Rogers Holdings, Jim Rogers, who has been investing in startups recently, said, "These founders were smart people and they reached out to me and asked, would you invest with us, and I said yes." Rogers added he's "investing in the founders" and not the companies. Rogers has invested in four startups in 12 months.
