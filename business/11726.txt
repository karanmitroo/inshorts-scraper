Investment banking firm Goldman Sachs has officially launched GS Bank, an internet-based savings bank, in the US. The online-only bank allows customers to open accounts with a minimum deposit of $1 and offers an interest of 1.05%. This comes after Goldmanâ€™s recent acquisition of GE Capital, the online deposit platform of business conglomerate General Electric.
