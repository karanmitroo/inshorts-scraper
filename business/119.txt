After being arrested in the INX Media money laundering case, ex-Finance Minister P Chidambaram's son Karti has told a Delhi court, "I'm not a Hindustan leaver like others. I'm a Hindustan returner." He was arrested at the Chennai airport after he returned from London on Wednesday. The court sent Karti to one-day CBI custody for not cooperating with the investigation.
