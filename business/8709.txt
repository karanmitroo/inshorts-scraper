Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani has lauded Infosys co-founder and former Chairman of UIDAI, Nandan Nilekani, for his work on Aadhaar. Nilekani's work will go down in history, Ambani said. Further, Ambani also praised the ability of the PM Narendra Modi-led government to embrace projects that were not initiated by them, like the unique identification program Aadhaar.
