E-commerce major Amazon has announced to spend $1.5 billion to build an air cargo hub in Kentucky, US, that will create nearly 2,000 jobs. Amazon agreed to a 50-year lease for about 900 acres of property from Northern Kentucky International Airport. In 2016, Amazon said it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service.
