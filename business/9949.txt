The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday permitted commercial banks to issue rupee-denominated bonds in overseas markets called masala bonds, for their capital requirements and infrastructure and affordable housing. This was part of RBI's new measures for boosting trade in India's $72 billion corporate debt market. The RBI further said lenders can up debt issue support to 50% from 20%.
