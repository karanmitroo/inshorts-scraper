David and Frederick Barclay, the billionaire owners of Daily Telegraph, bid more than $751 million (over â‚¹4,800 crore) for London's Grosvenor House hotel. The property was put up for sale three years ago by its current owner, the Sahara Group. The company is controlled by businessman Subrata Roy, who was imprisoned in 2014 for defrauding investors and released on parole.
