About 95 tonnes of oil have reportedly been leaked into the North Sea from UK-based oil and gas major BP's platform. The platform (75 km west of Shetland) was shut down following the spill caused by a technical issue. Earlier in 2014, BP was asked to pay a $18.7 billion fine for negligence, the largest corporate settlement in US history.
