HarperCollins Publishing India has announced that it will provide what it calls "pawternity leave" to its employees who adopt pets. HarperCollins employees will be able to take 5 working days off when they adopt a dog, cat or any other animal. "Pet children need as much attention [as human children], if not more," CEO Ananth Padmanabhan said.
