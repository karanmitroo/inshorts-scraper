State-owned Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) has become the country's first lender to start the distribution of the government's Indian Gold Coins. Available in the denominations of 5, 10 and 20 grams, the coin, bearing the national emblem of Ashok Chakra on one side and Mahatma Gandhi's face on the other, was launched by PM Narendra Modi in November 2015.
