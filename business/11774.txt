Oil firm Cairn India on Friday posted its biggest quarterly loss of ₹10,948 crore for the quarter ended March, compared to a loss of ₹240 crore in the year-ago period. Declining oil prices led to impairment charges on the firm's non-producing assets, it said. Further, ₹9,432 crore loss was reported for the entire fiscal, against ₹4,480 crore profit in 2014-15.
