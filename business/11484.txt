Kotak Mahindra Bank on Wednesday reported a 32% year-on-year increase in standalone net profit to ₹695.78 crore for the quarter ended March. Net interest income (bank's core income) rose 65.40% to ₹1,857.24 crore. The bank, however, said the latest quarterly and fiscal results could not be compared with previous periods because of ING Vysya Bank's merger on April 1, 2015.
