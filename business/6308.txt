Billionaire Richard Branson has shared a video of former US President Barack Obama beating him in a water sports challenge. The two held a "kitesurf vs foilboard learning contest" at the British Virgin Islands. "I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 metres...only to look over and see Barack go 100 metres on...kiteboard!" shared Branson.
