Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the Land Bill is in rural India's interest and it should not be blocked as it provides for irrigation, rural infrastructure and housing. "Most Bills in the past have been cleared on the strength of consensus. If they come out with a consensus, fair enough, else the constitutional process will go on," he added.
