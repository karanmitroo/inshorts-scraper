Venture Capitalist (VC) investments in India from October-December last year saw a fall of $600 million to $1.51 billion against $2.12 billion in the year-ago period, according to a report by VC database CB Insights and consulting firm KPMG. Analysts attributed the drop to the cautious nature adopted by the VC firms before investing in Indian startups.
