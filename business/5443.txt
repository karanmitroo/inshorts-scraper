NDTV has told Supreme Court it will not tender an apology for its coverage of Pathankot terrorist attack in January 2016. NDTV had allegedly revealed the location of suspected Pakistan-based terrorists involved in the attack. In November, the government had asked NDTV India to go off air for a day for revealing 'sensitive details', but later suspended the ban.
