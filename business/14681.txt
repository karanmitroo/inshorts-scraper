The Consumer Affairs Ministry on Saturday hiked the minimum export price for onions from $425/tonne to $700/tonne in an attempt to check the rising onion prices in the country. Unseasonal rains in onion-producing regions had affected production, causing a steep rise in prices. The government had also floated a tender for the import of 10,000 tonnes of onions.
