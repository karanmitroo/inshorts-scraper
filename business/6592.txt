India on Wednesday signed a deal with the United Arab Emirates allowing it to fill 60 lakh barrels of oil, which is about half of the underground crude oil storage facility at Mangalore. This reportedly is a part of India's plan to build oil reserves for emergencies that will help "ensure India's energy security," Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.
