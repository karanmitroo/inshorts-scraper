An ex-Monsanto executive has been awarded over $22 million for informing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about the firm's accounting irregularities, the executive's lawyer said on Tuesday. The award was tied to an $80 million settlement between the SEC and the biotechnology firm in February. It is reportedly the second largest award under the SEC's whistleblower programme.
