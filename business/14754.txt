The Bombay High Court on Thursday lifted the ban imposed on Nestle India's Maggi noodles by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The court's verdict stated that the "principles of natural justice" and procedures were not followed before imposing the ban. However, the court ordered to retest the noodles before being allowed to hit the stores.
