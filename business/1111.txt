Amul has reportedly filed a case in Gujarat High Court against India's five trademark registry offices for allowing other companies to use its brand name. Amul alleged that companies making underwear, tractors and other items were advertising under its name. Earlier, Amul had won a case against Registrar of Trademark, Kolkata, for registering brand 'Imul' which sounded similar to Amul.
