The Indian Railways has reported a 1,000% increase in the bookings for AC-I class tickets after notes of ₹500 and ₹1,000 denomination were scrapped. Agencies suspect that this is an attempt to short-circuit the government's crackdown on black money. Railways officials launced a probe into unusual booking patterns and imposed restrictions on the number of wait-listed tickets, reports said.
