Mercedes-Benz India has said the GST Council's recommendation to raise cess on luxury cars from 15% to 25% will affect its plans for expansion under India's "Make in India" programme. "We feel deprived," said Mercedes-Benz India MD and CEO Roland Folger. SUVs and luxury cars, among others, currently attract a cess of 15% in addition to 28% GST rate.
