Continuing with its policy of naming and shaming defaulters, the Income-Tax department released a list of 31 defaulters on Wednesday, owing over Rs 1,500 crore to the exchequer. The department asked the defaulters to “pay tax arrears immediately”. The list includes Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure (Rs 401.64 crore) and Pune-based Patheja Bros Forging & Auto Parts Mfg Co (Rs 224.05 crore).
