China's first Bitcoin exchange BTCC has been acquired by a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund following a crackdown by Chinese officials. The exchange which was earlier known as BTC China was founded in 2011 by Bobby Lee, the brother of cryptocurrency Litecoin's creator Charlie Lee. BTCC currently offers cryptocurrency mining pool, wallet, and exchange services on one integrated platform.
