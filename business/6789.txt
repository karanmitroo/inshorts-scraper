Billionaire investor George Soros lost nearly $1 billion (over ₹6,800 crore) as a result of the stock-market rally spurred by Donald Trump’s surprise presidential election, the Wall Street Journal reported. Soros has been cautious of the stock market amid the possibility that Trump's policies, such as increasing tariffs on Chinese imports, could hurt global trade, according to reports.
