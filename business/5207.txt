Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the Centre has issued an advisory to restaurants asking them to stop imposing service charge as it is not a tax, only a tip. The government had earlier asked all hotels and restaurants to display notices that 'service charges are voluntary', allowing consumers dissatisfied with services to choose not to pay for it.
