Global mining giant Rio Tinto has predicted some 85 million tonnes (MT) of Iron ore to be exiting the global markets in 2015, compared to 125 MT in 2014. Global prices have fallen over 50% in a year due to overproduction, touching all-time lows of $58/tonne this week. Chinese mines are likely to absorb most of these losses.
