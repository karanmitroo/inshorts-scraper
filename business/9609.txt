US automaker General Motors (GM) on Friday said that it will recall nearly 4.3 million vehicles worldwide due to a software defect that can prevent air bags from deploying during a crash. GM said that the latest recall involved trucks, cars, and SUV models from 2014-2017. The company was earlier involved in a record recall involving defective Takata air bags.
