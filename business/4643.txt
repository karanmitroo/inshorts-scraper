Tata Motors on Tuesday said it has reduced its managerial workforce by up to 1,500 people domestically as part of an organisational restructuring exercise. The management, however, said blue collar jobs have not been impacted. With this move, Tata Motors joins a number of firms in the IT sector where the estimated number of job cuts is at over 50,000.
