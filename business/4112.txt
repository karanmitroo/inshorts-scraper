The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has started printing currency notes of ₹200 denomination, the third denomination notes to be printed after demonetisation. According to reports, the new notes with advanced security features, are unlikely to be circulated through ATM machines to avoid recalibration of machines. The proposal to issue ₹200 banknotes was cleared by the RBI in March.
