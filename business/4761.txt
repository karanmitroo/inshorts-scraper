Air India Chief Ashwani Lohani has termed the over ₹48,000 crore debt in the company's books as "insurmountable" and blamed the erstwhile UPA government for its precarious finances. Lohani, in a Facebook post, also took on critics for blaming the company and its employees. Notably, Air India is surviving on a ₹30,000 crore bailout package spread over a 10-year period.
