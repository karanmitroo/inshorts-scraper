Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai on Monday slammed Executive Vice Chairman Vishal Sikka for blaming Co-founder Narayana Murthy for the crisis in the company to cover up his "bad performance". He further said Sikka wanted to leave since February "by his own admission". Notably, Sikka blamed "unrelenting, baseless, and increasingly personal attacks" for his decision to step down as CEO.
