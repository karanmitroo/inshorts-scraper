Micro-blogging site Twitter’s stock surged more than eight percent on Wednesday following a hoax that the company has received a take-over offer. The fake news was published on a website similar to Bloomberg’s and it went viral. The report said that Twitter was “working closely with bankers after receiving an offer to be bought out for $31 billion”.
