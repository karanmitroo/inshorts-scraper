BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan has said Sensex's record high is because the steps by the Indian government have been phenomenal over last few years. "Demonetisation, Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar card linking, GST, bankruptcy code...are going to ensure that India is going to move forward with a bigger acceleration," he added. Sensex closed above 34,000 for the first time on Tuesday.
