Individuals and entities can pay taxes online using debit or credit cards after GST is rolled out, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said. "You need not open account in banks of government...if you have account in a private bank you can transfer money and it will reach the government," Adhia added. The government proposes to roll out GST by April 2017.
