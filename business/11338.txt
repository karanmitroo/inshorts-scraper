Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has criticised self-regulation on call drops by telecom operators, stressing on the need for "quality service". Earlier, Airtel had announced it would adopt self-regulation if call drops through its network exceed 1.5% of total calls and use the penalty towards social causes. Notably, the Supreme Court had earlier quashed TRAI's recommendations on call drops.
