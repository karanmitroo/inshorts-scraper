Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's billionaire Founder Jack Ma in an interview to CNBC said, "I think in the next 30 years, people will only work four hours a day and maybe four days a week." He said the use of artificial intelligence will reduce working hours. "We should make machines that can do things that humans can't do," he added.
