India and Bangladesh on Thursday launched transhipmentâ€‹ operations at the Ashuganj port in Bangladesh. The facility will enable India to transport goods to the North-eastern states and further to Myanmar through Bangladesh, reportedly reducing costs by nearly 50%. This is part of an India-Bangladesh deal signed earlier to use each other's territory for transiting goods to a third country.
