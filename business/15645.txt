In order to provide some relief to banks, which are facing an increase in non-performing assets (NPAs), the RBI has allowed them to use up to 50% of the provisioning buffer they had till 2014. This will enable banks to use more funds from their emergency reserves to compensate for NPAs. Earlier, banks could use only 33% from their buffer.
