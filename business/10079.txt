Raghuram Rajan, whose term as the RBI Governor ends in September, will be the first Governor in 25 years whose term will not be extended. Rajan had announced in June that he will step down on September 4, at the end of his three-year term. The RBI on Saturday announced the appointment of Urjit Patel as its new Governor.
