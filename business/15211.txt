The Consumer Affairs Ministry is reportedly going to drag Nestle to court on behalf of consumers in the context of the Maggi fiasco. The petition will be filed to seek damages for selling unsafe products, showing misleading advertisements and practising unfair trade. Ram Vilas Paswan, Consumer Affairs Minister, met with officials on Friday to discuss the course of action.
