Police have claimed to crack the multi-crore Speak Asia scandal, in which 24 lakh people were duped of over Rs 2,200 crore, as they arrested the main conspirator, Ram Niwas Pal(40). Pal along with his associates, reportedly created several companies and lured people to invest in them for profits. But the company shifted its base from India before repaying investors.
