SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has said NPAs (non-performing assets) are treated as criminal in India. "NPA is treated as criminal, which it should not be. There is no permission for failures...But failures will take place," she said. Bhattacharya further said that loans were given when GDP growth was high, expecting that the accounts would not turn bad.
