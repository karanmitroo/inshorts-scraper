The government on Wednesday extended the timeline for states to join the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) by a year to March 2017. The move would help states which could not enrol in or operationalise the scheme due to several reasons including elections and regulatory approvals. The UDAY scheme aims at the revival of debt-laden power distribution companies (discom).
