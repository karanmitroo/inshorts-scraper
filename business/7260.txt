After reports of tax exemption on depositing old notes by political parties, the Finance Ministry on Saturday said that they do not enjoy “any immunity” and are liable to be questioned by tax authorities. “All reports on the alleged privilege to political parties are false and misleading," it said. Further, political parties cannot accept old notes as donations, it added.
