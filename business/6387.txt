The Income Tax Department has asked taxpayers to verify online the deposits they made post demonetisation and respond to queries in case of any mismatch. The department is using data analytics to identify taxpayers whose transactions are not in line with their tax-paying profile. Earlier, the department said it will question 18 lakh taxpayers whose deposits don't match their profile.
