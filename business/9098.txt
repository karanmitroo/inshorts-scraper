Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi accounted for nearly half of the ₹65,250 crore black money disclosures made under the Income Declaration Scheme, tax officials said. Hyderabad reportedly topped the list with ₹13,000 crore, while Mumbai and Delhi received disclosures worth over ₹8,000 crore each. The government, however, has not released a state-wise break-up, to ensure confidentiality.
