McDonald's officials in Japan Wednesday apologised for a human tooth and plastic pieces found in the burger chain's food, in two different incidences. The plastic piece was found in an ice cream sundae in Dec by a child, whose mouth was injured by it. In another case, a customer had found a human tooth in a Big Mac in August.
