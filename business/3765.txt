President Donald Trump’s campaign committee paid $50,000 (₹32 lakh) in June to the law firm now representing Donald Trump Jr. in a case over a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer while seeking damaging information against Hillary Clinton. The payment came almost two weeks before news of the meeting involving Trump’s eldest son and two other Trump confidantes was reported.
