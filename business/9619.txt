The Revenue Department has extended the due date for filing tax returns by taxpayers, required to submit audited accounts, to October 17 from September 30, 2016. This applies to taxpayers whose business receipts exceed ₹1 crore or professional receipts exceed ₹25 lakh. This has been done because the last date for declarations under Income Declaration Scheme is also September 30.
