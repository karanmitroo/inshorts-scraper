Drug maker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has recalled over 64,000 bottles of the generic versions of its cholesterol-lowering drug - generic Lipitor - in the US, regulators said. The move comes after a pharmacist reportedly found a 20-milligram tablet in a sealed bottle marked for 10-milligram tablets. This is at least third recall of the drug in last two years.
