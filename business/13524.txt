Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday accused the Centre of inflating India’s GDP growth rate “on the basis of highly dubious data-series”. He argued that when calculated on older basis points, the government’s 7.4% growth rate dropped to 5.2%. “Changing data-series may help manage global headlines for a while, but won't help fundamentals," Yechury said.
