Following Reliance Jio's letter that alleges Cellular Operators Association's norms of being biased towards incumbent operators, COAI has responded that the new entrant's letter is "slanderous". Jio is labelling established operators as "Incumbent Dominant operators", COAI said, adding, this is "mischievous". The allegations are believed to be motivated to tarnish the COAI's reputation, it added.
