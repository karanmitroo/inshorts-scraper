Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said that the additional 1% tax on inter-state sales proposed in the Goods and Service (GST) bill, which was opposed by some political parties was "resolvable". The 1% tax was proposed as manufacturing states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu felt they'd lose returns on the money they spent for putting up infrastructure, Jaitley added.
