The CAG has criticised Railways over improper cleanliness and management of linen, and suggested putting in place a mechanism to ensure strict compliance to norms. It said the washing and sanitation of linen and blankets are not done as per norms. The CAG added at many storage depots, fresh linen was stored haphazardly and was exposed to dirt and contamination.
