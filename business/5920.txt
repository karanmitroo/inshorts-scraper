The world's biggest pension fund, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, posted the biggest quarterly gain in its history at $92 billion. The gain came as Japanese stocks surged and a plunge in the yen boosted overseas investments after Donald Trump's victory. Notably, this is the fund's second straight quarterly gain after it posted losses that wiped out all investment returns.
