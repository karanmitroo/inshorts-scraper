Infosys former Chairman R Seshasayee on Friday said he was unable to understand Co-founder Narayana Murthy's motivations for the "persistent vendetta" against him. He said it was "patently offensive" that Murthy quoted anonymous whistleblower allegations, which have been proved wrong, to give an impression that he lied to shareholders. Seshasayee said Murthy "misleadingly" attributed words to him.
