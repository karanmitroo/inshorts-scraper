The RBI on Wednesday submitted to the Supreme Court a list of defaulters owing ₹500 crore or more to public sector banks. While making the submission, the RBI said it is “extremely necessary” to keep the names on the list confidential due to the “fiduciary relationship” between the RBI and the banks, and between the banks and customers.
