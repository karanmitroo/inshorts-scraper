Billionaire Warren Buffett once in an interview said, "Invest in as much of yourself as you can. You are your own biggest asset by far." "Anything you invest in yourself, you get back tenfold," Buffett had stated, adding, unlike other investments, "nobody can tax it away; they can't steal it from you". Another advice by Buffett is "never lose money".
