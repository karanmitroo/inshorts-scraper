The German parliament on Wednesday approved the third Greek bailout, worth nearly $95 billion. A three-hour debate in the lower house saw 454 votes in favor, 113 against and 18 abstentions. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said there were no guarantees the bailout would work, but "it would be irresponsible not to seize the chance for a new start.”
