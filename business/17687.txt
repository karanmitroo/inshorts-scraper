The world's biggest automaker, Toyota, Monday said it has suspended production at its two Indian auto assembly plants (near Bangalore) after certain employees resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors. The move, which will see the lock-out of about 6,400 employees, comes after the company failed to hammer out a labour deal.
