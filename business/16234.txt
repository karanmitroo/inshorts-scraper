After Tuesday's record crash, the benchmark Sensex Wednesday slipped further and closed 78.64 points lower at a three-week low of 26,908.82. The Sensex continued to remain under pressure due to sustained selling by foreign funds amid tumbling oil prices. The Nifty too fell in the trade and ended 25.25 points lower at 8,102.10--also its weakest close since December 17.
