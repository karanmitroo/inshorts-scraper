The Maharashtra government, Saturday, decided to scrap the land allotment deal with Videocon, wherein the latter was to be allotted 100 acres of land in Navi Mumbai for its Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The decision was taken because the project was not progressing and there wasn't complete agreement on the clauses of memorandum. The deal was signed in 2008.
