China devalued its currency, the Yuan, on Tuesday after poor economic data, in a move it billed as a free-market measure. The official guidance rate was set down nearly two percent to 6.2298 Yuan per dollar from 6.1162 the previous day. The central bank called it a "one-off depreciation" but economists were reportedly divided over the move.
