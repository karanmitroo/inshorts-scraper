Lufthansa Airlines has been directed by State Consumer Redressal Commission to pay Rs.20 lakh to a 70-year-old businessman, after the International airline downgraded his ticket during his flight from Frankfurt in 2010. In his complaint, Shiv Prakash Goenka claimed that he opted for business class for health reasons, but the airline staff had downgraded his ticket to economy class.
