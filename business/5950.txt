Tata Sons has agreed to pay $1.18 billion to Japanese telecom operator NTT DoCoMo in an over two-year-old dispute. In April 2014, DoCoMo decided to sell its entire 26.5% stake in Tata Teleservices and withdraw from mobile telephony in India. However, Tata Sons refused to buy back the shares at the pre-determined prices, after which DoCoMo sued Tata Sons.
