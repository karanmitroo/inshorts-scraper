McDonald's India's estranged partner Vikram Bakshi has said over 80 outlets of the fast-food chain in east India have been shut due to discontinuation of supplies by its logistics partner. He added that outlets in the north are also under pressure. Notably, this comes amid the ongoing legal battle between Bakshi and McDonald's over the termination of franchise agreement.
