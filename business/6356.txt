London-based cleaning company Naturist Cleaner is offering £45 an hour (around ₹4,000) to women "of all ages and figures" who would clean private houses wearing only slippers and gloves. The firm's clients must agree to a strict "no touch" and no pictures policy. "It's a service for the nudist community...There's nothing sexual about the business at all," the firm said.
