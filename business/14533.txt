India's foreign exchange reserve (forex) dipped by $2.9 billion in the week to $349 billion, as Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was selling dollars to prevent rupee's sharp devaluation. RBI has sold $6.3 billion in the previous two weeks. The devaluation of Yuan raised the dollar demand globally, including India, which weakened the rupee. One USD presently equals Rs 66.39.
