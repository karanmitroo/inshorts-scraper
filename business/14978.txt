Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited has banned employees across all its group companies from using mobile phones in offices. The company had implemented this at Zee Entertainment in April 2015, and has now extended it to all offices including the Mumbai-based newspaper DNA. The move is aimed at avoiding the misuse of social networking websites including WhatsApp, which can be distracting.
