Australia's largest bank Commonwealth Bank of Australia has said its CEO Ian Narev will step down within 10 months. This comes amid pressure from government after 53,700 alleged breaches of money laundering laws by the bank. Notably, the announcement of Narev's pending departure comes less than a week after the bank said he "retains the full confidence of the board".
