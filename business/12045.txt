Indian conglomerate Adani Group was on Sunday granted approval from Australia's Queensland state government for three mining leases, with a proposed investment of $7.7 billion, under the company's Carmichael project, the Reuters reported. The project, which was supported by the Australian government, was earlier challenged in local courts for potential environmental damage, leading to its delay.
