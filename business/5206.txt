According to a Finland-based study, food security of about 1.4 billion people globally is dependent on imports and an additional 460 million people live in areas where imports can't compensate for the lack of local production. Developing countries with water scarcity showed high dependency on food imports. The research used FAO's statistics analysing global production efficiency from 1961 to 2009.
