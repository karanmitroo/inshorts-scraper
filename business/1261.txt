Native American tribe Navajo Nation has sued Wells Fargo for $50 million, claiming the bank targeted tribal members with "predatory sales tactics". The tribe alleged that the bank opened unauthorized accounts and pressured people, particularly the elderly, to enrol in services they did not need. They also claimed the bank stalked local events like basketball games to sign up customers.
