The government has come up with a uniform definition of 'startups', under which an entity   would be considered a startup for up to five years from the date of its registration. Further, its turnover should not exceed â‚¹25 crore for any of the financial years. Also, entities formed by splitting or reconstructing existing businesses will not be considered as startups.
