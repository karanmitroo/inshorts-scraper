Capital markets regulator SEBI on Thursday said that unlisted firms that raise funds from 49-200 persons through securities without a public offer document “may avoid penal action if they provide the investors with an option to surrender securities”. Such firms would further be required to offer to refund the invested amount along with 15% interest per annum.
