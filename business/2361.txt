The UK told American aircraft manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday that it could lose out on future British defence contracts because of its dispute with Canadian rival Bombardier. The US had earlier imposed a 220% duty on a new line of Bombardier jets after Boeing complained that Bombardier received unfair government subsidies. Notably, Bombardier provides over 4,000 jobs in the UK.
