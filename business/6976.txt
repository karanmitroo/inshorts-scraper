About 97% of the demonetised ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes have been returned to banks, causing the government a setback in its fight against black money, reports said. Banks received about ₹14.97 lakh crore in scrapped notes by December 30. This beat the government's estimates that ₹5 lakh crore of ₹15.4 lakh crore in scrapped money will become worthless, reports added.
