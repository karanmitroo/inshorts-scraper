Ousted Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry and independent director Nusli Wadia are going to contest the proposal to remove them from the boards of Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals. They will make both written and verbal representation to the shareholders in this respect. Notably, the two companies have called extraordinary general meetings next month, seeking removal of Mistry and Wadia.
