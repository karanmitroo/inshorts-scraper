The combined value of Tata Group's top ten listed companies, including Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has fallen by over $10 billion (nearly â‚¹68,000 crore) since Cyrus Mistry's ouster. Excluding TCS, Tata shares have fallen twice as much as the market. Notably, Mistry has resigned from all Tata companies, saying he was shifting "the battle to a larger platform".
