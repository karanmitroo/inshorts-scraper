Price of Bitcoin fell for the fifth day to around $3,100 after Chinese Bitcoin exchange BTCChina said it would stop all trading from September 30. Bitcoin has now slumped over 35% since reaching an all-time high of over $5000 on September 1. The slump was also influenced by comments of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who called Bitcoin a "fraud".
