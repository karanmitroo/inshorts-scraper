The cyber heist of $81 million (over â‚¹525 crore) from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the New York Federal Reserve last year was "state-sponsored", FBI has said. In February 2016, hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and used the SWIFT messaging network to order the transfer of money from its account. The cash later disappeared in the Philippines' casino industry.
