Passengers on a flight from Jakarta to Melbourne were warned to watch for measles symptoms after a toddler, who contracted the disease, may have caught it on the plane. The three-year-old boy was admitted to hospital one week after flying. Passengers have been asked to remain alert of the disease, which has an incubation period of up to 18 days.
