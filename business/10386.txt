IT industry body Nasscom on Wednesday said that while the GST Bill will create a "rational tax regime", it would also create multiple taxation points, which would be a “challenge” for the IT industry. Suggesting changes to GST Model Law, Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar stated that there could be 111 different taxation points under it against a single point now.
