Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while presenting Union Budget 2017 said the Service Tax regime is largely unchanged as it will be replaced by GST soon. However, items like railway e-tickets, micro-ATMs and fingerprint readers will become cheaper on government's digital payments push. Solar tempered glass used in solar panels and Liquefied Natural Gas will also become cheaper.
