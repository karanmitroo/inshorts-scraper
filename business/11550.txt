The RBI has released draft guidelines for on-tap licensing of universal banks in the private sector, under which it would accept applications at any time. Under the existing policy, the window for licensing is opened periodically. Non-banking financial companies, experienced individuals, and firms that are not part of large conglomerates can seek bank licences subject to certain criteria.
