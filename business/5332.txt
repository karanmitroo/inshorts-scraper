Mumbai police said on Saturday they have arrested the man behind a call centre scam that targeted thousands of Americans, netting more than $300 million (around â‚¹2,000 crore). The US authorities said at least 15,000 people had been targeted by the Mumbai-run tele-fraud. Notably, the call centre's agents had impersonated federal officials and demanded payments for non-existent debts.
