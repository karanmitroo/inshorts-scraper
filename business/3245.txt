Walmart has apologised for a display inside one of its stores that appeared to show guns as back-to-school items. A photo showing a glass case full of guns with the sign "Own the school year like a hero" went viral. Walmart reportedly described the display "truly awful" and that it is "working diligently" to find out the store.
