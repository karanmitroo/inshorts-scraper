Supreme Court on Wednesday deferred a verdict on Sahara's plea seeking permission to raise more debt on its three overseas hotels. Sahara needs to deposit an initial $1.6 billion to secure its chief Subrata Roy from jail. The apex court sought further details from Sahara on the proposed loan. The case will now be heard on January 9.
