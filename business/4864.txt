United Airlines passenger Lucie Bahetoukilae has said she landed in San Francisco instead of Paris after the airline did not notify her of a gate change. United employees missed her destination while checking her boarding pass, flying her nearly 5,000 kilometres in the wrong direction from Newark to San Francisco. Meanwhile, United Airlines has apologised for the "horrible failure."
