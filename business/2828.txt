Finance Minister Arun Jaitley put private sector debtors on notice, saying they have to pay their dues or allow others to take control of the business. “Through the bankruptcy law, I think this is the first time that debtors...are being taken to task,” he stated. Results of proceedings against major debtors would dictate how the banking situation improves, Jaitley added.
