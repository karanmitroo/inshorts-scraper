Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Tuesday said operating profit likely fell 24.5% to $7.12 billion, in April-June, its lowest in two years due to slowing growth in the company’s cash cow smartphone business. The world’s largest smartphone maker has seen profit fall as competition heats up from Chinese makers of low-priced yet feature-heavy handsets.
