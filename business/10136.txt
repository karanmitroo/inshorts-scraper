The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on Tuesday issued e-KYC norms, through which operators can instantly provide activated SIM cards by using biometric details and Aadhaar card to verify the consumer's identity. This is in contrast to the current procedure which involves tele-verification and takes 8-10 hours. This is a move towards ease of doing business, a DoT official said.
