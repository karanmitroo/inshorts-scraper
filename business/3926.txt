Author Chetan Bhagat said he's glad that the government is going to sell "black hole Air India", adding it can never make money. Stating that the airline burns taxpayer money, Bhagat said that the â‚¹30,000 crore pumped into the airline by the government is "all wasted and gone now!". Earlier, the government gave its in-principle approval for Air India disinvestment.
