Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said transporting coal through inland waterways can save up to  ₹10,000 crore per year. “Inland waterways will help in saving logistics costs and boost movement of goods and passengers across the country," Gadkari said. Notably, Parliament will discuss a bill to convert 111 rivers across India into National Waterways during the ongoing Winter Session.
