Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has said that Bitcoin "ought to be outlawed" as it doesn't serve any socially useful function. He said, "Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight." He further added that Bitcoin is going to give a lot of "exciting times" to people as it rides up and then goes down.
