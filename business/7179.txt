The Reserve Bank of India is said to have asked 14 banks in the Jogulamba Gadwal district in Telangana to submit CCTV footage for alleged irregularities in depositing demonetised currency. The RBI reportedly issued these orders based on a request by the Central Bureau of Investigation, which received complaints about irregularities conducted by the managers in these banks.
