India on Friday said it has formally ratified the World Trade Organization's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), aimed at easing customs procedures to boost commerce. India is the 76th WTO member to accept the TFA, which will come into force once two-thirds of the 162 members ratify it. According to WTO, TFA can increase annual global merchandise exports by $1 trillion.
