The Supreme Court on Monday directed real estate firm Supertech to deposit ₹10 crore for refunding money to the investors who wanted to opt out of its Emerald Towers project in Noida. However, Supertech told the court that it had already paid ₹107 crore to the investors, adding that depositing ₹10 crore would be "too much" for it.
