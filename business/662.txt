Cybersecurity expert John McAfee has said that over 50% of the world will be using cryptocurrency in five years. He added, "The half that doesn't is going to be the half that probably doesn't have smartphones or any access to the internet." Earlier, McAfee said that he will eat his own "d**k" if Bitcoin doesn't hit $1 million by 2020.
