The UK has conveyed to India that its request for extradition of Vijay Mallya, who has been declared a proclaimed offender, was certified by the secretary of state. While handing over the request, India had asserted it has a “legitimate” case against Mallya. Notably, Mallya, whose now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes ₹9,000 crore to various banks, fled from India in 2016.
