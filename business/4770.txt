The research by Yoga guru Baba Ramdev and Patanjali MD Acharya Balkrishna to generate electricity using a bull's pulling power has yielded initial results. The main aim of the over one-and-a-half-year research is to ensure that bulls do not get slaughtered. The design, involving a turbine, has reportedly managed to yield nearly 2.5 kilowatts of power.
