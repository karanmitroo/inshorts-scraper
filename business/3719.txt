The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has upheld a tax demand raised on a ₹642.54 crore investment by a US network in NDTV in 2008. The I-T department alleged that NDTV tried to evade ₹218.30 crore tax and demanded penalty of ₹436.8 crore. NDTV said it will continue to fight the "misguided case" whose order has been passed with inconsistencies.
