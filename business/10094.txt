Amid speculations over the goods and services tax rate, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said, moderate taxes and high evasions cannot coexist. If taxpayers pay taxes, it will help bring tax rates lower, he said, adding that more the evasions, the higher will be the tax rate. The Parliament had earlier in the month passed the GST Bill.
