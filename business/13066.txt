Walmart on Friday announced their plan to shut down 269 stores globally. The move will see 154 stores, including all 102 Walmart Express stores, in the US and 115 stores in Latin America to be closed. Last year during an investor presentation, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon mentioned that they will review their fleet and will close the low-performing stores.
