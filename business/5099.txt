India's second-largest private sector lender HDFC Bank cut as many as 6,096 jobs in the January-March quarter owing to increased digitisation. This is the second straight quarter of job cuts by HDFC, which had cut over 4,500 jobs in the last quarter. There is room for more job cuts in the future, HDFC's Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankar said.
