Following Vishal Sikka's resignation as the CEO, an Infosys executive said Sikka was "deeply unhappy" with Ravi Venkatesan's appointment as Co-chairman in April. Sikka reportedly told executives close to him that he "wanted to leave" because he and Venkatesan had a tough working relationship. Sikka was also unhappy with the appointment of a panel to "advise" him on executive strategy.
