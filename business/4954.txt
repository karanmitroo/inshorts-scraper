Central Railway has suspended three inspectors for allegedly giving "misleading" information in an RTI reply, which created an impression of a 'scam', a senior official said. Reports stated its commercial department was involved in a "catering scam", alleging it purchased a 100-gram curd cup for â‚¹972. However, Railways clarified that typing errors in the reply led to miscommunication.
