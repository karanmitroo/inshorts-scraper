Britain's central bank, The Bank of England, on Friday announced it will provide Â£250 billion to ease the country's financial markets. This comes amid the UK's stock markets suffering huge losses following the nation's exit from the European Union. Further, the bank has also planned several measures to deal with a "period of uncertainty and adjustment", it added.
