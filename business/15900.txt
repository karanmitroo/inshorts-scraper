Swiss prosecutors searched offices of the Geneva subsidiary of HSBC bank in an inquiry into money-laundering. The raid comes more than a week after allegations that HSBC's Swiss private bank helped wealthy clients evade taxes. HSBC said it was "co-operating with the Swiss authorities." and had shut down accounts from clients who "did not meet our high standards".
