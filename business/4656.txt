Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, in a letter to its shareholders, said that it will continue to be a "challenging" journey for the firm but it is one worth fighting for. “It is within us to embrace the tough choices and to move headlong, unabashedly, into creating great new features," he added. Sikka further said Infosys will remain “differentiated and iconic”.
