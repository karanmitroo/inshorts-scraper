BlackBerry on Thursday announced that it had given Chinese manufacturer TCL the right to use its brand on future phones and sell them globally. However, the deal does not extend to India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Indonesia, where BlackBerry has an existing licensing deal. TCL has already built BlackBerry's Android-equipped DTEK50 and DTEK60 smartphone using blueprints.
