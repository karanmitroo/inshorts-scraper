Tata Motors CEO Guenter Butschek said the company's journey so far has been tougher than expected but now it's a more responsive firm. Referring to decisions like demonetisation, he said, "The challenge (was) much tougher because we weren't agile...to implement changes fast." However, "If something like that happens this year, we'll be able to tackle it much better," he added.
