The Competition Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday stayed penalties totalling around â‚¹106 crore imposed against air carriers SpiceJet and IndiGo by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year. CCI had found the air carriers along with Jet Airways guilty of colluding in fixing fuel surcharge rates for transporting cargo. The tribunal said it would hear the matter next in March.
