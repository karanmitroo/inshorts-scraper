Reliance Communications shares fell by 20% to an all-time low on Monday, after it reported a $150 million fourth-quarter loss and worries about its heavy debt load resurfaced. The Anil Ambani-led company posted its second straight loss, dragged down by a price war following Reliance Jio's entry. The company has also reportedly delayed repayment of loans to over 10 banks.
