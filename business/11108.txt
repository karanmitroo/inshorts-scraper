Telecom regulator TRAI has said it will seek details of the radio-link technology (RLT) that is allegedly used by telecommunication firms to mask call drop details, before setting up an enquiry against them. Notably, Aircel and Vodafone have been using the RLT beyond the levels of their peers, according to a TRAI report based on a drive test in Delhi.
