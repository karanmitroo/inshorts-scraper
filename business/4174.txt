For the first time in many years, Infosys Co-founders, including Narayana Murthy kept away from the company's annual general meeting, which was held on Saturday. "We have no idea why they did not turn up," a company spokesperson stated. "It is surprising not to see Murthy at the AGM as he used to sit in the front," an investor stated.
