The government on Monday launched a QR (quick response) code-based payment solution called BharatQR to allow cashless payments without a card swiping machine. BharatQR has been jointly developed by MasterCard, Visa and Rupay. A customer will scan the BharatQR code to pay directly to a merchant. Currently, BharatQR is integrated into ICICI Bank’s Pockets app and HDFC Bank’s PayZapp.
