After being banned for over six weeks, US based online cab-hailing service Uber Friday resumed its operations in Delhi. Uber was compelled to apply for a radio taxi license in the national capital to restart its cab services. Following this, Delhi has become the only place in the world where Uber has been registered as a taxi operator.
