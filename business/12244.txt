The US seed company Monsanto is free to leave India if it doesn't lower the prices of the genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds as per government's direction, said a minister on Wednesday. This comes in the backdrop of the government's plan to develop its own GM cotton varieties next year. Monsanto controls over 90% of the seed supply to India.
