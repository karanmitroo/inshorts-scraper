Reacting to Vijay Mallya's arrest in London and his bail thereafter, a user tweeted, "King of Bail times! #VijayMallya." Another user wrote, "He gets bail even before our television channels could erase 'Vijay Mallya Arrested' from their screens." Another tweet read, "Time to get Bail is inversely proportional to the time taken to arrest."
