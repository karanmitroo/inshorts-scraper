The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty fell around 0.8% for the week ended May 20. Market sentiment remained hesitant amid Indian banks reporting losses and the possibility of an earlier rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, analysts said. While the benchmark Sensex fell 187.67 points to close at 25,301.90, broader Nifty lost 65.20 points to settle at 7,749.70.
