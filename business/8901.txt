Net profit for Nifty 50 companies is likely to grow by 6% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2016-17, the highest in eight quarters, a report by brokerage Motilal Oswal said. The performance will be driven by domestic cyclicals like automobiles, cement, and select private sector banks. Also, consumer and NBFCs are likely to post healthy growth, the report claimed.
