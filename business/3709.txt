A China flight was delayed for five hours after cabin crew discovered that a child had sneaked through security and boarded without a ticket. The four-year-old was with his parents who thought they didn't need to buy a ticket for him because he wasn't tall enough. The family, with two adults and three children, was later removed from the flight.
