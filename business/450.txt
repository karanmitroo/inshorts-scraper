Union Minister of State for Railways Rajen Gohain has said that only about 18.6% of the components of the Bullet Train project would be Japanese. "Make in India is an integral part of the project," he added. The foundation stone for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor was laid in September last year and is targeted for completion by 2022-23.
