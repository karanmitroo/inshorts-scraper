The Department of Telecom has allowed Reliance Communications to share spectrum with Reliance JioÂ in nine circles, a regulatory filing said on Friday. This will reportedly allow both the companies to offer 4G internet services on a 10 MHz block in a 800 MHz band, which, according to the International Telecommunications Union standards, can provide speeds up to 80 Mbps.
