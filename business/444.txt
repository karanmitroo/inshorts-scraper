Cybersecurity expert John McAfee has dared a Twitter user to meet him after the user asked McAfee to write white papers for "shit coins" instead of spreading false information about cryptocurrencies. He also shared his address and phone number. McAfee tweeted, "Bring your sorry ass here and say that to my face...You don't show up you'll be my b**** forever."
