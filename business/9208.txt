The Nitish Kumar-led Bihar cabinet on Tuesday waived tax on export and bottling fee on Indian made foreign liquor and beer manufactured in the state. This would help liquor manufacturers in the state to find better markets for the export of liquor in other states, a state government official said. Notably, sale and consumption of liquor are banned in Bihar.
