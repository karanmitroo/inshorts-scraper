India's agricultural sector, which employs more than half of the country's population, is facing distress as global climate change is causing erratic monsoons, thereby posing a severe threat to the economy, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha has said. Citing climate change as "the number one risk", he added that India's economy is "still very dependent on the monsoon".
