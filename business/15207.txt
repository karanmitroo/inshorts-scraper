Scandal-hit bank HSBC said on Tuesday that it would trim its global headcount by almost 50,000, half of which would come from the sale of its business in Brazil and Turkey. The bank plans to cut about 8,000 jobs from Britain and relocate its headquarter from London. The restructuring is being done to improve the bank's sluggish performance.
