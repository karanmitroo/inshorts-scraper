Conglomerate ITC on Wednesday said its US-based arm King Maker Marketing Inc has ceased to be its subsidiary with immediate effect. This comes after the company's corporate management committee approved the divestment of company's entire shareholding in King Maker. Earlier in October, ITC had said it will sell its entire stake in the wholly-owned subsidiary for around $24 million.
