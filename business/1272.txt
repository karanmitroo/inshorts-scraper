The Income Tax Department on Monday conducted surveys at nine Bitcoin exchanges across India on suspicion of alleged tax evasion, according to reports. It is reportedly being conducted for "gathering evidence for establishing the identity of investors and traders, transactions undertaken by them...related bank accounts used, among others". Notably, Bitcoin is currently not regulated in India.
