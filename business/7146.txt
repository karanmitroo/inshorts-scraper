Amid a crackdown on black money hoarders, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday asked the people to give more information to the government about such financial wrongdoings. Authorities were able to conduct raids on hoarders because people came forward and gave them tip-offs, Modi said. Information from common citizens was “many times higher” than that obtained through government machinery, he added.
