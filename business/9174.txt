The Indian Railways on Thursday announced a facility of transfer of berths which remain vacant at the train-originating station to subsequent stations for clearing waitlisted passengers at such stations. Passengers will receive an SMS on their registered mobile indicating the berth number allotted. At present, three lakh berths per year go un-utilised.
