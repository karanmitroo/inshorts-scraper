Arvind Panagariya, who resigned as Niti Aayog's Vice Chairman to return to academia, has said, "The kind of job I have in Columbia University would be almost impossible for me to get again." Panagariya further revealed he had talked about his resignation with PM Modi a couple of months ago. Notably, August 31 will be Panagariya's last day in office.
