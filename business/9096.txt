Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz India has said that it can introduce models with alternative fuels, including plug-in hybrids and full electric vehicles, by 2018. "We have our cars ready but we need support... from the government," CEO Roland Folger said. This would be two years ahead of the government's plan to put 6-7 million electric vehicles on road by 2020.
