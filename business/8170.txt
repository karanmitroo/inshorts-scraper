Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said deposits of the now-defunct ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes in bank accounts will not enjoy tax immunity. "If the money is legitimate... there is nothing to worry about. But if it is illegal money, source will have to be disclosed... if it is crime money, or bribe money... it is trouble", Jaitley added.
