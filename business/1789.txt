The government has disqualified around 3.09 lakh directors on boards of companies that had failed to file financial statements or annual reports for three consecutive fiscals. Over 3,000 disqualified were directors in more than 20 companies each, which is beyond the legal limit. The move comes as a part of government's drive against black money.
