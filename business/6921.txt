Indiaâ€™s GDP is expected to grow by 7.1% in the fiscal year 2017, its slowest pace of expansion in three years, according to government data released on Friday. The economy had expanded at 7.6% in 2015-16. This is also slower than the 7.7% expansion predicted before PM Modi's decision to ban high-value currency notes.
