Retail inflation, measured on consumer price index (CPI), fell to 30-month low of 7.31% in June, mainly on account of lower prices of food items, including vegetables, cereals and meat. Moreover, the wholesale price index (WPI) inflation also dipped to a four-month low of 5.43% in June. It had soared to a five-month high of 6.01% in May.
