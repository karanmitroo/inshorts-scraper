The RBI on Monday asked banks in India to switch to only online filing of forms related to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on the government's e-biz portal, starting February 8. Currently, RBI allows both online and physical filing of FDI forms for users. The decision was taken after assessing the readiness of banks to file these forms online, RBI said.
