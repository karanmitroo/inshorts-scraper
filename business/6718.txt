According to reports, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel on Wednesday told the parliamentary panel on demonetisation that the RBI and the Centre initiated discussions on the move early last year. While questioning the autonomy of RBI, the Congress members of the panel reportedly asked whose decision it was to demonetise the old high-denomination currency notes.
