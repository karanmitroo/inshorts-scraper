A Chinese investor has been charged of reaping $29 million (â‚¹194 crore) illegal profit from insider trading ahead of US telco Comcast's purchase of DreamWorks Animation. The lawsuit claimed that before the deal became public, the investor bought DreamWorks stock using five accounts including one belonging to his parents. These shares were sold after DreamWorks rose 47% following the deal.
