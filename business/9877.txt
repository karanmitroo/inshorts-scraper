The United Nations Development Programme said sub-Saharan African economies lose a combined $95 billion each year because of fewer job opportunities for women than men. Urging greater equality for economic growth, the organisation said African women make 70 cents for every dollar earned by men and the human development index drops by 0.75% for every 1% increase in gender inequality.
