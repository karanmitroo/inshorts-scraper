China's insurance regulator on Friday said that it will take control of private insurer Anbang Insurance Group for a year. It said that Anbang had violated laws and regulations which "may seriously endanger the solvency of the company." The regulator said that Anbang Chairman Wu Xiaohui has been removed from his post and is being prosecuted for "economic crimes."
