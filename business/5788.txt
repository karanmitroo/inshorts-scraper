Royal Bank of Scotland has awarded bonuses in shares to its top nine executives worth almost $19.5 million (around ₹130 crore). The bank's senior managers were also paid $7 million (around ₹47 crore) in shares from earlier bonus awards. This comes despite the bank posting a ninth consecutive annual loss of $8.7 billion last year, since the 2008 financial crisis.
