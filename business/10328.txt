Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that an economic growth of 8% over the next 30 years will bring the world's "best" to India. He said that despite a global slowdown, India has become the fastest growing large economy with an over 7.5% growth rate. Further, without good governance, government-run schemes will not benefit the common man, Modi added.
