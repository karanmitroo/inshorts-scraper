US-based drug company Marathon Pharmaceuticals has said it will delay the launch of a drug for a deadly muscle disease after lawmakers criticised it for raising the drug's price by 6,000%. Democrat Bernie Sanders called the price “outrageous”, asking Marathon to reveal how it set the price. Earlier, Marathon said it will charge $89,000 for the drug available for $1,000-$2,000.
