The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed an order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that allowed the government to take over Unitech's management. It said the centre should have taken apex court's permission before moving NCLT. The tribunal, on December 8, had suspended all the eight directors of the realty firm over allegations of mismanagement and siphoning of funds.
