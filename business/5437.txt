Backing Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy's view on pay hike to COO UB Pravin Rao being "not proper", company's ex-director Mohandas Pai has said the salary in this case is "spectacular" but performance is not. Further alleging that the Infosys board was "misguided", Pai said the "fundamental problem" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka "without any justification".
