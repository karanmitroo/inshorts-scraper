The RBI has issued clarifications on hedging of currency for External Commercial Borrowings (ECB). The ECB borrower will be required to cover both principal as well as coupon payments through the hedges done, starting from the day of borrowing, the notification said. The hedging period will be for the entire life of the liability with a minimum one-year rollover option.
