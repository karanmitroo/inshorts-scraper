Samsung Electronics' shares fell as much as 7.2% on Monday, after touching their lowest level since August 2012, after the tech giant told customers to switch off and return their Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung shed about $14 billion in valuation in a single morning. It had earlier announced a worldwide recall of 2.5 million smartphones.
