The Gujarat government on Thursday rolled back the 5% Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed on industrial salt in the state's 2016-17 budget. Salt producers had earlier threatened to go on a strike demanding complete rollback on the VAT. The tax imposition is full of technical difficulties which would expose them to harassment from VAT inspectors, they had claimed.
