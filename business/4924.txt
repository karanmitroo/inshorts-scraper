A couple have claimed they were kicked off an overbooked Delta Airlines flight and threatened with jail and "foster care" for their children after refusing to give up a seat. They had purchased the seat for their older son, who travelled by an earlier flight. The staff said their two-year-old could not have his own seat due to US regulations.
