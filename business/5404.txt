UK's biggest buy-to-let landlord, Fergus Wilson, has called the police over online abuse after he banned coloured people from renting properties because of "curry smell" at the end of their tenancy. He also reported a video in which he was called racist. Earlier, he said he lost £12,000 (₹10 lakh) in costs after tenants left his property smelling of curry.
