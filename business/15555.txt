Brent Crude prices rose 3% to hit a 2015-high of $63.29 on Thursday as US production showed evidence of slowing down. The monthly average for crude production turned negative for the first time since July 2014. Markets have been picking up gradually this year as lower prices discourage oil exploration and production.
