Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday maintained its monetary policy and refrained from signalling an expansion in its stimulus programme to meet the 2% inflation target. The central bank's expansion of the asset-buying programme is majorly hindered by weak exports and falling energy prices. According to analysts, BOJ is likely to cut its inflation and GDP targets for this fiscal.
