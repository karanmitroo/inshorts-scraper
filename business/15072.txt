The board of Housing.com on Wednesday reportedly sacked co-founder Rahul Yadav as CEO. Yadav's "behaviour towards investors, partners and the media" was the reason behind his ouster, the company said at a board meeting held at its Mumbai head-quarters. "The board believed that his behaviour is not befitting of a CEO and is detrimental," Housing.com said in a press statement.
