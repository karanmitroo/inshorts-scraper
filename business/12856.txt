Facebook Inc on Friday decided to prohibit people from using its social network and Instagram photo sharing service for private gun sales. The decision was taken to counter the concerns that it was increasingly being used by people to bypass background checks on gun purchases. Facebook also has similar restrictions on other regulated goods like prescription and illegal drugs.
