A US-based team is claiming to develop the world's first legally compliant cryptocurrency backed by oil called OilCoin. Each token will represent the value of one reserve barrel of crude oil and is aimed at giving users protection from cryptocurrency volatility. OilCoin's public token sale, also known as the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), is expected to begin early this year.
