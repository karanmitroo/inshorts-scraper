Indian Railways has decided to restructure the management of railway stations in a corporate manner and has issued orders for the appointment of station directors. They will have experience in operations and commercial working, and will ensure stations serve as excellence centres. The move aims to improve the Railways' image, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve business activity.
