Japan's biggest automaker Toyota on Saturday said it had sold all shares in Elon Musk-led Tesla and cancelled its tie-up to jointly develop electric vehicles. Toyota said the shares were sold at the end of 2016 as part of a regular review of its investments. The company had bought approximately 3% stake in Tesla for $50 million.
