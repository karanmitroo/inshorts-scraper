Max Healthcare has denied overcharging patients for stents and insisted it was complying with the guidelines on the medical device's pricing. "We have not overcharged even a single patient for stent. We have complied fully and immediately with the NPPA order on stent pricing," it said. Notably, some hospitals have been issued show cause notices after investigations over stent pricing.
