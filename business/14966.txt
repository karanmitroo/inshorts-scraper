Irish software developer, Probendi, has filed an urgent procedure with a Milan court (Italy) against Apple, for using the term 'iWatch' and paying for its wording on Google’s search engine. Probendi owns the term's trademark in Europe and sees its customer base shifting to the American tech-giant. Probendi added that Apple repeatedly ignored the “requests and objections” sent to it.
