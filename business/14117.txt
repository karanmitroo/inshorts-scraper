After a more-than-expected third quarter revenue drop, Credit Suisse (CS) on Wednesday announced an overhaul to its trading and advisory unit, thereby eliminating 5,600 positions in the US, UK and Switzerland. The bank will raise $6.3 billion by selling stocks for a larger capital buffer in Switzerland. CS further plans for an initial public offering of its Swiss business.
