According to an official in the finance ministry, there is no proposal before the government on restricting domestic gold holding by individuals. This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of old high-value currency notes and some reports claimed that the government might impose restrictions on gold holding as many people have converted their black money into gold.
