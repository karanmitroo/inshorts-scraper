The RBI has admitted it has no details of irregularities or scams in exchange of demonetised currency notes by cooperative banks, an RTI reply revealed. The query sought details on irregularities committed by them, and on alleged corruption by officials. Notably, a week after demonetisation, RBI barred district cooperative banks from accepting old notes due to alleged money-laundering instances.
