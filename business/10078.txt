Around 10-15 airports would be activated by 2017 to aid the government's Regional Connectivity Scheme, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said on Saturday. "There are 31 or 32 unconnected airports and we are planning to activate some of them," he informed. On cargo operations, he said the problem lies in several tax rates on fuel in different states.
