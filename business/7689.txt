Tata Global Beverages, which removed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman at its board meeting, has not provided the meeting's video recording to him. The company said it cannot provide the video as no recording took place due to "system failure". Earlier, Mistry termed his removal illegal, stating the proposal was ruled out since it was not on the meeting's agenda.
