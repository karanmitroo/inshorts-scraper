The annual revenue of Indian telecom firms declined for the first time since 2008-09 to ₹1.88 trillion in 2016-17 due to competition from Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio, according to a CLSA report. It may further decline to ₹1.84 trillion in 2017-18, it added. Jio's aggressive pricing forced other telecom firms to cut prices, which affected their revenues, the report said.
