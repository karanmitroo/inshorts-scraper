The Sahara Group has, after several failed attempts, agreed to pay the full $1.6 billion in bail-money to release its jailed Chairman, Subrata Roy. The amount will reportedly be paid by next week. Roy has been behind the bars for over a year now, after failing to refund investors billions of dollars for a bond program that was ruled illegal.
