The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Wednesday clamped down on over 900 entities suspected of tax evasion to the tune of Rs 5-6 thousand crores. The entities were reportedly using the stock market platform to convert black money into legitimate-looking funds. The Board has referred the banned entities' cases to the Income Tax Department for further investigations.
