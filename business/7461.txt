Digital wallet Paytm on Wednesday launched a new feature that allows non-smartphone users to transfer and receive money through their Paytm accounts. The transactions will take place through a new toll-free number after users register their mobile number and set a four-digit PIN. Mobile recharge facility is also available through the toll-free number.
