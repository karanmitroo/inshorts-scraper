A former Nomura bond trader has said he was trained to lie to customers shortly after coming to the company in order to boost the firm's commissions. He said the tactics he learned included lying about where Nomura had bought or sold bonds and misrepresenting the price it paid. Notably, the trader pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.
