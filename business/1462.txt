Axis Bank has started cross-border payments over the blockchain using fintech company Rippleâ€™s technology. Currently, its retail customers in India can receive payments from RakBank in UAE and corporate customers can receive payments from Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. The bank says the technology can reduce the time for international money transfer to 5-10 seconds from existing 3-5 days.
