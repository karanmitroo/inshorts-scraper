Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said that in a "multi-polar world", it was becoming difficult to "unite" developing countries on trade-related issues due to conflict of interests. Only discussions have happened in the last two to three years without any "concrete" agreement, she stated, adding that it was a "trying time" for the global economy.
