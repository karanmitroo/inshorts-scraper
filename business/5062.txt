US stock index Nasdaq breached the 6,000-mark for the first time ever on Tuesday, following strong corporate earnings and President Donald Trump's promise of a major tax reform plan. The Nasdaq rose as much as 0.4% helped by gains in tech giant Apple. Last week, Trump promised to make "a big tax reform and tax reduction" announcement on Wednesday.
