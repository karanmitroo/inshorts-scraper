After months of speculation, Twitter on Monday named Co-founder and interim CEO Jack Dorsey as CEO. Dorsey served as interim CEO after the departure of Dick Costolo. He will also hold the CEO title of mobile-payments company Square but will no longer be the Chairman of Twitter. However, Dorsey will not be provided with direct compensation for his new role.
