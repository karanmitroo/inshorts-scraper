South Korea's spy agency has reportedly informed the country's parliament that North Korea could have been behind the world's largest cryptocurrency hack that took place last month. Hackers had stolen cryptocurrency worth $530 million from Japanese exchange Coincheck. The agency is investigating the incident based on similarities with past cases associated with North Korea, reports said.
