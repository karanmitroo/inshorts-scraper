The Bank of England on Thursday kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, a record low maintained since March 2009. The bank's Monetary Policy Committee, which takes decisions on interest rates, forecasted inflation to stay under 1% (below its target of 2%) until the next yearâ€™s second half, in the wake of the slump in oil prices.
