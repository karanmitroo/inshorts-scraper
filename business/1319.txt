The government on Friday extended the deadline for linking Aadhaar with PAN to March 31, 2018. It said this is to provide relief to taxpayers who haven't yet completed the linking of the two. The government also told the SC that it was ready to extend deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to avail various services and welfare schemes.
