The US Federal Reserve has fined Goldman Sachs $36.3 million for the alleged unauthorised use of confidential documents, which the Federal Reserve uses for supervising banks. It warned the bank to fix its policies to prevent similar violations. The regulator is also pursuing a permanent banking ban against former Goldman Sachs MD Joseph Jiampietro for disclosing Federal information to clients.
