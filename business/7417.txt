The Civil Aviation Ministry has warned airlines, which were allowed to temporarily accept demonetised banknotes, that it will investigate unusually high sales of flight tickets in a bid to check black money. It also issued instructions that PAN card would be mandatory for high-value transactions. The I-T Department will examine any suspicious transactions made during demonetisation, it added.
