Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar has said the economic slowdown that began in 2013-14 has bottomed out and the GDP is likely to grow 6.9-7% this fiscal. He said the downward cycle started in 2013-14, mainly because of the surge in lending to undeserving projects since 2007. In the next fiscal, growth would be about 7.5%, Kumar added.
