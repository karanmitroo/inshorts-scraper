RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said interest rates are not holding back the economy. He was speaking a day after keeping the interest rates unchanged for the second consecutive monetary policy review. He also asserted that RBI's move to clean up the balance sheets of the banks is not aimed at reducing the risk-taking appetite of the company owners.
