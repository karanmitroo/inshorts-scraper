American surfwear firm Boardriders' CEO Pierre Agnes has gone missing at sea in France on Tuesday. The 54-year-old had set sail early on the same day on a routine fishing trip but his boat was found washed up a beach empty in southwestern France. French authorities have deployed two vessels and three helicopters to search for him.
