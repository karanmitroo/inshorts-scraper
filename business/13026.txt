Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn in a blog post mentioned that cryptocurrency 'Bitcoin' has "failed". He cited reasons like rising and unpredictable fees, the system being controlled by a few people and hardships faced in the movement of existing money as reasons. "Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail...inescapable conclusion is that it has failed", he said.
