Prices of popular brands of potato chips in Japan surged as much as six times (500%) the retail price after the country's two major snack companies, Calbee and Koike-Ya, halted sales citing potato shortage. The sales halt reportedly came as a result of a poor potato harvest following typhoons and flooding, which hit Japan's Hokkaido in August last year.
