The Japanese economy ended flat in the second quarter at 0% growth quarter-on-quarter, missing economists' predictions for a 0.2% expansion. Further, its economy expanded by 0.2% on an annualised basis, as against the analysts' expectations for a 0.7% growth. Inflation too dropped for the fourth straight month in June despite the recent announcement of a stimulus package worth $276 billion.
