The US Treasury Department has placed five countries â€“ China, Japan, Germany, South Korea and Taiwan on its monitoring list aimed at tackling their trade imbalances with the US. It will assess if the countries are manipulating their currency for unfair trade advantages. The move enables the US to negotiate reforms with the countries but will not trigger economic penalties.
