Cryptocurrency mining site NiceHash Co-founder Marko Kobal has stepped down as the company's CEO. This comes after over $60 million worth of Bitcoins were stolen from the exchange's wallet in December 2017. Reportedly, Kobal will also sell his 45% stake in the company with a part of his stake expected to be acquired by an outside investor.
