In an effort to preserve the records and books in it's central library, RBI has decided to digitise over 1,50,000 pages of it's records which are old and require "sophisticated handling techniques". Records being digitised will include books, bound volumes and accession registers. However, it is not clear if these documents will be accessible to the public on the web.
