Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in a recent interview said, "I have never, ever, ever wanted to buy Twitter myself". He added, "I mean, come on, I got a good life right now, I donâ€™t need to do that". Ballmer said that Twitter must either sell itself to someone who can propel it or take an independent path.
