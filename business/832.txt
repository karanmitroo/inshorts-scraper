China's Kweichow Moutai, the world's most valuable liquor firm, is suffering from inventory shortages caused by rising nation-wide demand. Its main brand, Flying Fairy, which should sell for 1,499 yuan (nearly â‚¹15,000) a bottle, is reportedly being sold for double the price. UK's Diageo, the world's second-largest liquor firm has a valuation of $89 billion compared to Moutai's $145 billion.
