The government on Monday removed Sushil Muhnot from the post of Chairman and Managing Director of Bank of Maharashtra, four days before his scheduled retirement, for allegedly abusing his position. This comes after Muhnot was served a show cause notice to explain why he should not be removed from his post for allegedly occupying two houses.
