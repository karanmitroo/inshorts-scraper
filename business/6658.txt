Luxury department store Harrods has agreed to let staff keep 100% of money raised from restaurant tips. The store was earlier targeted by protesters after it emerged that the retailer kept 50% of discretionary service charge added to dinersâ€™ bills. The retailer is also reducing service charge rate to give customers more discretion over the amount they wish to contribute.
