France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay US authorities a $8.9 billion fine to avoid being tried in court for dealing with US-blacklisted countries, sources said. The deal forces BNP to plead guilty to the bank's deals from 2002 to 2009 with countries that Washington has blacklisted like Cuba, Iran and Sudan.
