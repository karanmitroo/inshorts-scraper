The US dollar on Wednesday fell to its lowest level in 3 years against several major global currencies. This comes after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin praised the declining value of the currency saying it is good for trade. The dollar index dropped to 89.245, falling below 90 for the first time since December 2014.
