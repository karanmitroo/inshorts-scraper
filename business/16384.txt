Flipkart Saturday said that it has raised $700 million from its new investors - Baillie Gifford, Greenoaks Capital, Steadview Capital, T. Rowe Price Associates and Qatar Investment Authority. Flipkart has also filed with Singapore-based companies' regulator ACRA to become a Public Company. The conversion procedure was mandatory after its number of shareholders exceeded 50 with the new investors.
