Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy on Monday called off the dispute with the board, saying he’s confident the company will deal with the concerns raised. “Let me stop. I have made a point, paying such large sums of money is confusing. Now they have to sort it out,” Murthy said. Earlier, Infosys co-founders raised concerns over CEO Vishal Sikka's salary hike.
