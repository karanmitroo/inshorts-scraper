An India Ratings and Research report has said the Public Sector Banks' loans will grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 9% till 2019-20. This low loan growth is reportedly owing to the limited availability of capital for the PSBs. Further, the report said this is the "bare minimum" growth needed to meet the expected operating and credit costs.
