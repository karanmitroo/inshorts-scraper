The Indian Railways Operating Ratio (paisa spent against a rupee earned) for this year has reached 96.96%, the worst in 16 years. This means the public carrier spent 96.96 paise for every rupee that it earned. Notably, the government had estimated in November last year that the operating ratio for 2016-17 would be 114%.
