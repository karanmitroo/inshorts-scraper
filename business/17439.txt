Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which powers four-fifths of all online commerce conducted in the world's second-largest economy, filed for IPO on Tuesday. The company is expected to raise upward of $15 billion and potentially surpass the $16 billion that Facebook Inc managed in 2012. It could become the largest Chinese corporation to have sought a home on US exchanges.
