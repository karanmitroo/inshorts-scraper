The US Federal reserve decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 0.00 - 0.25%, following the end of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Thursday. "Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term", FOMC said in a statement.
