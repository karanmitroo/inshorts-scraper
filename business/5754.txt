Charlotte Hogg has resigned as Bank of England's Deputy Governor after failing to disclose that her brother worked at Barclays, a bank which BOE regulates. Hogg broke the bank's code of conduct by failing to reveal the potential conflict of interest. Hogg had taken over the post at the UK central bank at the start of this month.
