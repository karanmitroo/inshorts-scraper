The government aims to disburse loans worth ₹1.8 lakh crore in 2016-17 under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) against ₹1.2 lakh crore in FY16, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said on Wednesday. MUDRA banks were established last year as state-owned institutions to provide loans to microfinance and non-banking financial institutions which then provide credit to MSMEs.
