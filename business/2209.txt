Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said that the GDP growth will bounce back in the second quarter as the macro fundamentals are strong. Referring to GST, he said, "When we build a bridge, we need to divert traffic, which leads to long queues of vehicles. But that is temporary, as things get normalised once the bridge is opened."
