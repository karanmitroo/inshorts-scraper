Google has denied reports that claimed that the company was planning to launch an app-based taxi service. "We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time," it tweeted. Google is one of the biggest investor in Uber. The report came the same day that Uber and Carnegie Mellon University announced a partnership.
