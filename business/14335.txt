Renault has reportedly received more than 25,000 bookings for its new Kwid in the first two weeks of its launch. With an 800 cc engine and a mileage of 25.17 kmpl, Renault claims Kwid is India’s most fuel-efficient car. The car competes with Maruti Suzuki’s Alto, Tata’s Nano and Hyundai’s Eon with its basic variant costing 2.57 lakh (ex-Delhi price).
