The Supreme Court on Tuesday held liquor baron Vijay Mallya guilty of contempt of court, asking him to appear before it on July 10. The court upheld a plea by a consortium of banks to which Mallya owes over â‚¹9,000 crore.  Mallya had fled to London in March 2016, a few days before the banks moved the Supreme Court.
