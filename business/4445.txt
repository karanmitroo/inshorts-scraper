A labour-rights group, whose investigators were detained by Chinese authorities, has asked Ivanka Trump to use her "influence" to help in their release. The group said the three undercover activists were targeted because they were investigating a supplier connected to Ivanka's shoe brand. The activists were going to publish a report alleging low pay and excessive overtime at the company.
