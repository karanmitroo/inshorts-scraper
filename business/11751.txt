The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited has cleared the insurance policy for all 21 nuclear reactors in India. The NPCIL also finalised the insurance policy for suppliers, officials said. Under a 2010 law, NPCIL can seek damages from suppliers in case of accidents. This comes as India plans to build 60 nuclear reactors to move away from fossil fuels.
