Virgin Group Founder Richard Branson in a recent blog post said, "We’ve lost plenty of talented people from across the Virgin Group to the draw of entrepreneurship - and I’ve always supported them in taking the plunge". He added, "Working for someone else can act as a launch pad for greater things, but choosing the wrong employer can stifle you".
