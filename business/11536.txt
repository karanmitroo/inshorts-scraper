The Centre has asked all its departments and state governments to widen the scope of the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme to include all welfare initiatives operated by them, directly or through implementing agencies. The scheme, launched in 2013, aims to transfer subsidies directly into people's bank accounts and currently covers LPG subsidy and student scholarships, among other initiatives.
