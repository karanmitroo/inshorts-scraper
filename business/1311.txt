French baby milk maker Lactalis and health authorities have ordered an international product recall after 26 children fell sick in France. "Nearly 7,000 tonnes" of production may have been contaminated with salmonella but couldn't ascertain how much has been consumed, a company spokesperson said. The recall will affect consumers in countries including China, Pakistan, Britain, and Sudan.
