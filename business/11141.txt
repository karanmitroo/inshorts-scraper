Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said India’s economy has become “stronger” and the government is trying to bridge the gaps to keep up the growth momentum. He further said the government has sufficiently empowered the banks to recover their dues but added that they will have to maintain their credit lending facility so that lending for growth continues.
