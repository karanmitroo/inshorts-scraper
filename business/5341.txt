Samsung Electronics on Friday announced preliminary results for Q1 2017, posting its highest quarterly operating profit in three years at over $8.7 billion. This comes amid an ongoing bribery and embezzlement trial against the group's Chief Jay Y Lee and the company's recovery from the global recall of its exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones.
