Almonds and pistachios are likely to see a price-hike this festive season as the El Nino brings a dry spell to California, which contributes to 90% of almonds and 50% of pistachios in the Indian market. Wholesale prices of almonds and salted/roasted pistachios are expected to reach Rs 875-900/kg and Rs 850/kg respectively, against last year's prices of Rs 750/kg.
