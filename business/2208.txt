Dove has apologised after being criticised over a Facebook advertisement showing a black woman turning into a white woman after using Dove Body Wash. Dove said, "An image we recently posted... missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully. We deeply regret the offense it caused." Dove added that it meant to convey the product was for every woman.
