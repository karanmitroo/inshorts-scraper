To promote cashless transactions, government think-tank NITI Aayog has suggested a scheme to reward winners of digital payments based on weekly and quarterly lucky draw of e-transaction numbers. NITI Aayog has asked the National Payments Corporation to conceptualise the scheme. The scheme would also provide recognition to urban and rural local bodies, who innovate to promote electronic payments.
