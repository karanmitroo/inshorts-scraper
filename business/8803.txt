State-run carrier Air India has reportedly posted an operating profit for the first time in a decade of ₹105 crore in the 2015-16 fiscal. The growth was attributed to lower costs of fuel and a rise in the number of passengers. The airline, which is working to improve its financials, had an operating loss of ₹2,636 crore in 2014-15.
