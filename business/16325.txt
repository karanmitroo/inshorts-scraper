The Cabinet Monday approved the ordinance route for amendments to Land Acquisition Act. "The changes in Land Acquisition Act have been done after extensive consultations with states," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. Last week, the government approved ordinances to raise foreign direct investment limit in the insurance sector and to facilitate e-auction of coal blocks for private companies.
