Ratings agency Moody's has estimated that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries may spend as much as $23 billion on Jio over 3-4 years. Reliance has already spent more than $31 billion on Jio since its inception. Moody's said the next phase of capital spending will probably cover digital TV, fibre-to-home, and the enterprise business in addition to improving mobile phone services.
