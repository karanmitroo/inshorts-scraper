Auto industry body SIAM has suggested a reduction of GST on electric vehicles to 5%, besides one-time income tax deduction of 30% of vehicle price to promote them. It has also suggested that EVs be exempted from road tax and toll charges. SIAM added that all electric two-wheelers and passenger vehicles used for personal purposes be exempt from parking charges.
