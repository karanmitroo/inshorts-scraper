UK firm Mothercare has issued an urgent recall of its popular baby bouncer after a 10-week-old baby slipped through it and dented his head. Mothercare has urged all parents who purchased the 'Loved So Much' bouncer to return them, as they can be dangerous if "assembled incorrectly". The company said the action has been taken to ensure safety of customers.
