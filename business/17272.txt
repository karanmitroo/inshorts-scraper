Twitter on Thursday announced the resignation of two senior executives, COO Ali Rowghani and Chloe Sladden, the VP of media, as the user growth flagged and its stock price traded at nearly half its value six months ago. However, the company said it didnâ€™t intend to replace Rowghani, whose responsibilities will be taken over by other managers.
