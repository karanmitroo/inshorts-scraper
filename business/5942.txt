Coffee chain Starbucks is going to set up shop in Italy for the first time in 2018, CEO Howard Schultz said. Italy is "the most important market for me personally... Why? Because the Italians mastered coffee way before Starbucks," Schultz stated. "This store will be the culmination of a great dream of mine, 34 years in the making," he added.
