According to British financial services company HSBC, India's underlying inflation momentum stands at 5.5% year-on-year, while it is higher in rural India at 6.5% and is 4.5% in urban India. The report said that the trend is because rural Indians have not benefitted much from cheap imports as their urban counterparts probably due to inefficient distribution channels.
