Taiwan's Quanta Computer, which manufactures laptops and assembles watches for Apple, on Thursday announced its plans of establishing a manufacturing base in India. "We're gathering materials for evaluation", the company said. The move comes after rival Foxconn announced that it will establish 10 to 12 facilities in India by 2020.  Quanta's manufacturing facilities are all currently in China.
