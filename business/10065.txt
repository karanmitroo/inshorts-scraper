Ratings agency Fitch has cut its outlook for Turkey's sovereign debt rating to "negative" from "stable", saying the last month's coup confirmed the "risks to political stability in the country". Political uncertainty in the country could hurt its economic policy, Fitch said. The poor rating will elevate the prices Turkey pays to borrow on debt markets, reports said.
