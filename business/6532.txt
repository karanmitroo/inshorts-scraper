German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, “Coffee-house operators from Germany have to pay their taxes, while it’s not at all clear with Starbucks whether they pay taxes anywhere." According to Merkel, many companies “managed to pay taxes nowhere in the world". Her comments come amid Starbucks appealing an order by European Union regulators to repay $32 million (₹218 crore) in taxes.
