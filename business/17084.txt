For the second time in a week, Air India faced twin troubles simultaneously with the snag-prone Dreamliners when they had to be grounded. Deck doors of flight AI113 flying to UK, with 126 passengers onboard, could not shut properly despite several efforts. Another Boeing 787, which was to fly to Sydney with 246 passengers, developed a snag and was grounded.
