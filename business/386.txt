National carrier Air India will reportedly retain its brand name even after it is privatised by the government. Reports claimed that the government plans to lay down a condition to prospective bidders that the airline's name should be retained after the disinvestment process. The government is also considering selling between 51% and 76% stake in the airline, reports added.
