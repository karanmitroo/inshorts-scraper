Uber on Thursday launched a hashtag campaign on Twitter and Facebook called #MumbaiWantsUber which urges the city's residents to protest against new rules proposed by the Maharashtra government. Uber also requested the people to sign a petition addressed to the transport regulator. The new rules proposed may force Uber to restrict its fleets and constrain its ability to set prices.
