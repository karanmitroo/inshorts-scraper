Volkswagen AG will recall 80,000 cars from its luxury division Audi due to issues with the fuel injection system, Audi said Saturday. The company said around 35,000 of the affected vehicles are from China. The cars were made between April 2011 and April 2012, and "in rare cases customers may notice a smell of fuel in affected vehicles," it added.
