Taxi aggregator Uber on Monday said that it has signed a co-operation pact with the Army Welfare Placement Organisation (AWPO) under the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for creating job opportunities for retired defence personnel. Under the agreement, ex-servicemen can enrol as driver-partners on Uber's platform. Earlier, Ola Cabs had launched a similar initiative called ‘Ola Sainik’ in August.
