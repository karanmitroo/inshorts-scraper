Richard Smith, the CEO of US credit reporting company Equifax, has retired as both CEO and Chairman of the board on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Equifax reported that information of 143 million Americans had been exposed after a hack. "At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership," Smith said.
