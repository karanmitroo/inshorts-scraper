UK-based telco Vodafone has posted an over two-fold increase (135%) in losses at $5.5 billion (â‚¹37,382 crore) in the first half of this fiscal. The decline was attributed to impairment of non-cash assets of its Indian arm affected by competition, like that from Reliance Jio. "Competition in India has increased in the year, reducing revenue growth and profitability," Vodafone said.
