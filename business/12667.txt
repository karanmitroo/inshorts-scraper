The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty on Thursday plummeted to fresh 21-month lows, closing 807.07 points down at 22,951.83 and 239.35 points lower at 6,976.35 respectively. Analysts attributed the losses to weak quarterly earnings by public sector banks and the US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellenâ€™s pessimistic outlook on the US economy, signalling a delay in its interest rate hike.
