German pharma and chemicals major Bayer on Monday said it has made an offer to buy US agricultural biotechnology firm Monsanto for a total value of $62 billion in cash, including debt. This comes a week after Monsanto revealed it has received an unsolicited takeover offer from Bayer. Notably, the merger would create the world's biggest agricultural supplier.
