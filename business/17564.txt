The longest period of slump in India's automobile market, with its sales declining for a second straight year, has led to the loss of about 2,00,000 jobs, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Many auto companies have reportedly gone for downsizing due to production cuts. Notably, the Indian auto industry employs around 19 million direct and indirect workers.
