The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, plans to open 50 more wholesale outlets in India over four to five years, and launch online operations to sell to small traders. In 2013, Wal-Mart did not open a single wholesale outlet in India despite plans to open eight during the year. At present, Wal-Mart already runs 20 such stores in India.
