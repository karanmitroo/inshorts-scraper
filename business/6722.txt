The US Department of Labor has sued American computer technology major Oracle, alleging that the company conducted discriminatory employment practices. Oracle is accused of paying white male workers more than minorities and women in similar positions and favouring Asian people for technical roles. Oracle has said the lawsuit is politically motivated, based on false allegations and without merit.
