IndiGo has launched a new offer allowing travellers to prepone their flights if they reach airports early, at the cost of â‚¹1,000. 'IndiGo Early' will be available to domestic flyers who wish to prepone their flights to earlier ones, but the time difference between these flights should not exceed four hours. Notably, the scheme cannot be used to postpone flights.
