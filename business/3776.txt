Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said the GST is a very simple tax and several misunderstandings are being spread about the new regime. "Those who follow the law will not be called to the office for assessment,” Jaitley said. However, he said that those who try to be “over clever” and try to “circumvent the law” will face consequences.
