Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has said that the government is not disappointed with credit rating agency S&P's decision to keep India's sovereign rating unchanged. He said the agency has opted "to play a little cautious". Garg added that S&P has said "about everything which Moody's have also" talked about, like India's structural reforms, growth story, and institutional reforms.
