The US Federal Reserve on Friday admitted it inadvertently published a confidential staff forecast of rate hikes prepared for the June 16-17 Federal Open Market Committee meeting on its website last month. The disclosure came after the US congress criticised the Federal Reserve's handling of a 2012 leak of market-sensitive internal policy deliberations to a private financial newsletter.
