Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has directed officials to ensure that meals served onboard trains carry information about the quantity, date of packing and the contractor supplying it. The letter, which was issued on Wednesday, said guidelines should be implemented with immediate effect. As of now, the packets only mention if the food is vegetarian or non-vegetarian.
