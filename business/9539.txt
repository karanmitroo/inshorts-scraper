Finance Ministry officials on Thursday clarified that the government has no plans to devalue the Indian rupee and its value will be determined by the market. This comes after the rupee fell on Thursday amid reports of currency devaluation. Notably, currency devaluation helps combat trade imbalance as exports become cheaper, and more competitive in the global market.
