United Airlines shares plunged over 11% during intraday trade on Thursday, following an earnings call where CEO Oscar Munoz said the airline dug itself "in a hole" in regard to competition. It is the biggest one day decline for the company's stock in eight years. This comes after the airline released disappointing forecasts for the fourth quarter.
