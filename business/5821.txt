Chinese smartphone maker ZTE has been fined nearly ₹6,000 crore ($900 million) for knowingly violating US sanctions in Iran and shipping banned US-made technology to Iran for six years. "ZTE lied to federal investigators and deceived their own internal investigators about their illegal acts," said the Attorney General. ZTE will be fined another ₹2,000 crore if it violates sanctions again.
