Jet Airways has signed an in-principle agreement with Air France-KLM to form a joint venture (JV) to expand its commercial cooperation with the European airline, reports claimed. The proposed JV will reportedly cover routes in India, Europe, and North America but finer details are still being negotiated. This would be Jetâ€™s first large-scale commercial agreement outside of UAE-based Etihad.
