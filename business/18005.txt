Karnataka High court on Saturday approved the petition filed by consortium of 14 banks, led by SBI, seeking winding up of Kingfisher Airlines Ltd (KAL). However, it has postponed the issuance of public notice about KAL's winding up for further hearing in January 2014. The judgement came after KAL's inability to revive the company by holding talks with prospective investors.
