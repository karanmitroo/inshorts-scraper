Air India plans to introduce premium economy class seats on some flights after Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad assaulted its employee. Gaikwad had insisted on travelling business class on an all-economy flight, and later hit the employee. This reportedly aims to accommodate MPs who are entitled to travel business class but fly on routes where it operates only all-economy flights.
