The BSE Sensex on Wednesday rose 240 points to end at 28,020, its highest closing in two-and-a-half months. The Sensex also crossed the psychologically important 28,000 level, amid hopes of a faster recapitalisation after the government announced plans for a comprehensive package for state-run banks and healthy core-sector growth. The 50-share Nifty shed 84 points to close at 8,453.05.
