State-owned power generation company NTPC has moved the Supreme Court against Delhi-based power distribution company BSES Rajdhani for not clearing dues worth â‚¹720 crore, pending since October 2015. NTPC said that it continued to supply power to the distribution company despite non-clearance of dues, because of earlier court orders restraining it from disconnecting power to BSES.
