All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) has said the RBI Governor Urjit Patel should take up "moral responsibility" for $1.77-billion PNB fraud and resign from his post. AIBEA said that RBI Governor's continued silence with regard to the scam is "surprising and astounding". It added this indicates the failure of RBI in non-monitoring the account of PNB's fraud-hit Mumbai branch.
