SpiceJet's Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh on Friday said that the airline has no plans to bid for Air India. “We are too small an airline to acquire Air India itself,” Singh said at an event in Gurugram. Notably, SpiceJet controls 13% of the domestic market share in comparison to rival IndiGo's 40%, which expressed interest in Air India.
