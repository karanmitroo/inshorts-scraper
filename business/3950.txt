The government has denied reports that education will become costlier under the Goods and Services Tax regime. The Finance Ministry called such reports "completely unsubstantiated". "There is no change made in any subject relating to education in the GST era, except to reduce tax rate on certain items of education such as school bags," a government statement said.
