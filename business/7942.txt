The government on Tuesday decreased the petrol price by ₹1.46/litre and lowered the diesel price by ₹1.53/litre, effective midnight. Petrol in Delhi will now cost ₹65.24/litre, while diesel will cost ₹54.37/litre. "The current level of international product prices of petrol and diesel, and the exchange rate (rupee-US dollar)" warrant a change in prices, the Indian Oil Corporation said.
