Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that if a central bank head is "pliant and subservient", he risks losing the respect of his team members. He, however, added that RBI governors, once in office, "develop backbone very quickly". Rajan further called for protection of both the "term (of the governor) and turf (of RBI)" to ensure independence.
