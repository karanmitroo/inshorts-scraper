Replying to an RTI query, the RBI said it has decided not to pursue a proposal for introducting Islamic banking in India. Islamic banking is based on the principles of not charging interest, which is prohibited under Islam. RBI said the decision was taken after considering "the wider and equal opportunities" available to all citizens to access banking services.
