Samsung Electronics has reportedly put forward a $7.5 billion buyout proposal before Blackberry, seeking its valuable patents that are expected to help Samsung in its battle with Apple. Representatives from the two companies met privately last week to discuss a possible transaction. Blackberry, however, feels that $7.5 billion is way lower than its projected asset value in the near future.
