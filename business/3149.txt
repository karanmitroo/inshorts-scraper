Colleen McQuillan, a Sydney-based woman, who was awarded $151,000 (nearly â‚¹97 lakh) after slipping on a grape in Woolworths supermarket in 2012, has lost her case on an appeal. A court found the company hadn't been negligent. Notably, Woolworths had denied negligence, breaching its duty of care, or that staff failed to keep proper lookout for grapes on the floor.
