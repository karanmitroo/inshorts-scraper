Warren Buffett, in his annual letter, said the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines, adding, "No one can tell you when these traumas will occurâ€“not me...not economists, not the media." Further, he wrote that during such periods of panic, one should not forget that "widespread fear is your friend as an investor" and "personal fear is your enemy".
