Following Cyrus Mistry's removal as Tata Chairman, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has spoken in his favour stating, “Cyrus was removed despite doing a reasonably good job”. It is "sad" to see Tatas attract such bad publicity, he said, adding, "Cyrus tried his best to divest legacy problems of the group." Further, he said, “relationship may have soured between both parties”.
