Food chain Chipotle's shares fell 8% after one of its Virginia franchise was closed over reports that customers were experiencing vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhoea after eating at the location. Chipotle said it is working with health authorities to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. A series of foodborne-illness outbreaks sent Chipotleâ€™s sales and stock price plunging in 2015.
