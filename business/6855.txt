Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Wednesday said, "Imposing service charge is an unfair trade practice. The consumers need not pay." Suggesting that consumers should instead give the money to "poor waiters", he further stated that the price list in hotel menu cards should reflect all the costs, including the service charge.
