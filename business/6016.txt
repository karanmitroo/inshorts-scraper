Bharti Airtel, which recently announced its decision to acquire Telenor's India operations, will gain 43 MHz of 1800 MHz spectrum across seven circles, which will be the biggest benefit to the telco from the deal. Airtel will further gain Telenor's subscriber base of 4.4 crore. Airtel will also assume Telenor’s spectrum liability of ₹1,650 crore and tower contracts.
