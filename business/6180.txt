Yahoo buyer Verizon, which struck a deal to buy the search engine for $4.8 billion last year, will reportedly be paying $250 million less to Yahoo. The payment has been reduced over two massive user data breaches revealed by Yahoo after the deal was finalised. Yahoo announced last month that its acquisition has been delayed to second quarter 2017.
