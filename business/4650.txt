Bank of England Governor Mark Carney fell victim to an online prankster who got him to joke about one of his predecessors' supposed drinking habits. The prankster, who was posing as Chairman of the central bank's court, Anthony Habgood, also got Carney to accept an invitation to a "soiree". Carney later dismissed his correspondent's message as "not appropriate at all".
