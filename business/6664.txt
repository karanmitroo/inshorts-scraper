After ICICI Bank refused to follow National Payments Corporation of India's (NPCI) advice to unblock Flipkart's payments app PhonePe from its platform, the corporation asked PhonePe to adhere to UPI norms. ICICI Bank had alleged that PhonePe allows users of only its own UPI handle to make payments via the app. The bank wanted Flipkart to end the “restrictive practice”.
