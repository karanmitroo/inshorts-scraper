San Francisco-based lending startup Social Finance's CEO Mike Cagney will be stepping down by the end of the year following allegations of sexual harassment at the company. A former employee filed a lawsuit in August alleging that he had been wrongfully terminated after reporting sexual harassment of colleagues. Cagney said the distraction of the lawsuit was hindering the company's growth.
