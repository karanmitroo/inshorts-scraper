Reliance Communications Chairman Anil Ambani has said that one needs "a pipeline into the RBI's printing press" to be in the wireless business. He said it is for those who have either unlimited money or have the ability to raise an unlimited amount of money. "Wireless telecom sector has engulfed many, many people and many, many companies," he added.
