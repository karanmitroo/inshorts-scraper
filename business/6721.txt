Search giant Google, which earlier stepped away from buying Twitter, on Thursday acquired the micro-blogging site's mobile app developer platform 'Fabric' for an undisclosed amount. Twitter launched Fabric in 2014 to allow developers to pick and choose different tools to improve their apps. Google will continue to operate Fabric and its related tools.
