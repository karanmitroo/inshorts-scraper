The government is reportedly preparing to open up commercial coal mining to private companies for the first time in four decades, with the aim of shifting India, the worldâ€™s third-biggest coal importer, towards energy self-sufficiency. Coal Secretary Anil Swarup told Reuters on Friday that the government is finalising administrative and financial plans, which should be ready in 2-3 months.
