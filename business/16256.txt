RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Saturday said there is a need for banks to clean up bad debts and restructure other possible NPAs (Non Performing assets) within a year. He favoured channelizing “full savings” of the households into the financial system. Rajan also said the bona fide mistakes made by the bankers should be protected by the government.
