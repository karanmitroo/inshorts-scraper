The Indian government is reportedly working on plans to incentivise temples to store nearly 3000 tons of gold in banks instead of vaults. Family vaults that hold nearly 17,000 tons of gold may also be encouraged to open up. The gold could be lent to reduce gold imports, which accounted for nearly 28% of India's trade deficit in 2013.
