As per the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Air India's claim of making an operating profit of ₹105 crore was wrong, with the airline understating losses of ₹6,415 crore from 2012-2015. In October 2016, AI had claimed an operating profit for the first time since 2007, but CAG officials have revealed a loss of ₹321 crore in 2015-16.
