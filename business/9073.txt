The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday kept its global growth forecast unchanged at 3.1% in 2016, after cutting its outlook for five straight quarters. Further, growth will increase slightly to 3.4% in 2017, the IMF said. Global growth will remain "subdued" this year following a slowdown in the US and the UK's exit from the European Union, the IMF added.
