The Central Excise department has filed a tax evasion case against online travel company MakeMyTrip for not depositing around â‚¹75 crore service tax collected for renting out hotel rooms. A senior company official was arrested and then released on bail last week. The probe found that many hotels having agreements with MakeMyTrip are not registered with the service tax authorities.
