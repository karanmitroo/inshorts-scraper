Airtel has launched 4G on mobiles, thus becoming the first in India to offer such a service. The 4G services, whose speeds are 10-15 times more than 3G speeds, will come at the same price as the 3G service. As of now, it has been launched only in Bangalore and the service will only work on iPhone 5S and 5C.
