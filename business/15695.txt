India will take advantage of the fall in oil prices by importing eight million barrels of oil from Iraq in order to fill its first strategic petroleum reserve (SPR). The Finance Ministry has allotted 24 billion rupees for this purpose. Last month, India had built its first SPR, having a capacity of 9.75 million barrels, in Andhra Pradesh.
