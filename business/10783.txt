Payment gateway firm Visa on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Walmart, alleging that the retail firm began testing a protocol that eliminated the need for signature verification while making transactions through a Visa debit card. Last month, Walmart had sued Visa for resisting the use of PINs for transactions. Walmart claims the signature verification process as "more fraud-prone".
