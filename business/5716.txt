The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013 requires every employer of an Indian workplace to create an 'Internal Complaints Committee' to handle cases of sexual harassment. Inquiries into complaints are required to be completed in 90 days. Redressals provided in the Act range from a written apology to termination of employment.
