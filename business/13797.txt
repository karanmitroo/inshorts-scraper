German regulators investigating the Volkswagen diesel emission scandal have expanded the probe to include over 50 models from 23 other brands like BMW, Mercedes, Ford, Volvo, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover. Emission readings in test conditions and data from portable meters in real-life tests of all the cars, German and foreign, are being compared, the KBA regulator said.
