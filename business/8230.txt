India's largest private sector lender ICICI Bank on Monday reported a 2.3% rise from the corresponding period a year back to ₹3,102 crore in the September quarter. Its muted growth was due to its highest quarterly increase in bad loans on a year-on-year basis in 10 years, which more than doubled to ₹32,178.60 crore from ₹15,857 crore a year ago.
