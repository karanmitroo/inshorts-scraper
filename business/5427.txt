Infosys Co-founder NR Narayana Murthy has said that up to 70% salary hike for company's top level person is "not proper". Murthy stated that salary of most of Infosys employees was increased by just 6% to 8%. Murthy's comments come after only 24% of the promoters voted in favour of a salary hike for Chief Operating Officer UB Pravin Rao.
