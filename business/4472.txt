A diamond ring was sold for £656,750 (₹5.5 crore) at an auction in London, 30 years after its owner purchased it for £10 (₹800), thinking it was a costume jewel. Its previous owner had bought the 26.27-carat diamond ring from a car boot sale in the 1980s, learning its value only after a jeweller said it could be valuable.
