Chipmaker Broadcom on Monday said it has offered to buy rival chipmaker Qualcomm in a cash and stock deal valued at $130 billion, including debt. Buying Qualcomm would make Broadcom the third-largest chipmaker, after Intel and Samsung Electronics. The deal if completed would be the biggest technology acquisition ever and will make Broadcom an over $200-billion company.
