The RBI released its macroeconomic report on Monday stating that a depreciating rupee and upward revisions in fuel prices have increased upside risks to both wholesale and consumer price inflation. The GDP is projected to grow at 5.7%, revised downwards from 6% in its previous survey (May-2013). Rupee is seen at 59.5 to a dollar level by fiscal end.
