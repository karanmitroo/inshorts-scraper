Deutsche Bank's shares fell over 3% on Monday after CEO John Cryan failed to secure a 'swift' deal to negotiate down the $14 billion fine (around ₹93,611 crore) demanded by the US. The lender was asked to pay the fine to settle an investigation into mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities, the primary reason cited for the 2008 financial crisis.
