Indian Railways on Wednesday launched its 'Roll-on Roll-off' service to carry loaded trucks on freight trains and reduce congestion on roads. The service is expected to increase the freight carried by Railways while cutting carbon emissions at the same time, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu claimed. The service, promised in the budget this year, was launched in Bihar.
