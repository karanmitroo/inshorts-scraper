Wind turbine-maker Suzlon on Monday said that it has completed commissioning of a 50.40 MW wind power turnkey project. "It forms an integral part of Suzlon's Jaisalmer wind park, billed to be the country's largest wind park," the company said. "The project will provide electricity to over 28,000 homes and curb 0.10 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually," Suzlon added.
