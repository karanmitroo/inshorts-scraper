Tata Motors on Tuesday approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) challenging a Delhi government notification banning the registration of diesel vehicles with engine capacities over 2,000 cc. The automaker told the NGT that the current Supreme Court order, which had upheld the ban, was intended to apply to private luxury automobiles only, and not all classes of vehicles.
