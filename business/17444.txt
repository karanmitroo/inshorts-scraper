Telecom operators Vodafone and Idea Cellular on Monday said they will resume 3G services in circles where they don't have spectrum through intra-circle roaming (ICR) pacts with other operators. Bharti Airtel has also announced resumption of its 3G services in circles where it doesn't have spectrum. The announcement follows the ‘Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal’ ruling last week.
