Oil prices slumped to near seven-year lows on Monday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday failed to reach an agreement on an oil production ceiling. US crude oil futures fell almost 6% while Brent crude dropped by 5.3%. OPEC countries are reportedly producing oil 0.5 million to 2 million barrels per day more than the demand.
