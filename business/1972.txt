Singapore currently doesn't plan to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, its central bank Chief Ravi Menon has said. He said the country already requires cryptocurrency intermediaries such as exchange operators to comply with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. He added that the bank's focus is to determine the risks that would require a regulatory response.
