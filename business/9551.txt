State-owned telecom operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Reliance Jio on Monday signed an intra-circle roaming agreement for 2G and 4G services. This will allow the subscribers of the two companies to utilise their networks across India and offer a better quality of services for both voice calls and data. Earlier, Vodafone had signed a similar pact with BSNL.
