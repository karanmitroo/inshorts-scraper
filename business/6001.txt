German lender Deutsche Bank's Chief Administrative Officer Karl von Rohr said that bonus cuts, announced in January, have not yet led to a mass exit of employees. "Fluctuation is normal and within the usual boundaries," Rohr said. Notably, the cuts will shrink Deutsche's bonus pool by about 80% and hit a quarter of its nearly 1 lakh employees.
