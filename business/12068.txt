India's infrastructure output grew an annual 5.7% in February, its fastest pace in nearly 13 months, mainly driven by a surge in production of cement and fertilizers, government data released on Thursday suggested. Cement production was up 13.5% from a year earlier and fertilizer output grew 16.3% year-on-year. Infrastructure accounts for nearly 38% of India's industrial output.
