Jaipur-based online auto classifieds platform CarDekho is reportedly set to acquire Zigwheels, an automobile portal owned by Times Internet. The company’s monthly traffic is estimated to be at 8 million visits. CarDekho’s parent company, Girnar Soft, had acquired Naspers-backed Gaadi.com last year, and hopes to now compete with the likes of Cartrade.com and Carwale.com.
