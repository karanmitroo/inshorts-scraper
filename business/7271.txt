Multinational online payments company PayPal has called Indian e-payments startup Paytm's logo "deceptively and confusingly similar" to its own in a complaint filed with the Trade Marks Registry. Paytm has "slavishly adopted the two-tone blue colour scheme," stated the complaint. Further, PayPal has also opposed Paytm's use of the term "Pay" and the similarity in lengths of the two logos.
