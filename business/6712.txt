The Debt Recovery Tribunal in Bengaluru on Thursday allowed a plea filed by an SBI-led consortium to recover unpaid dues of over ₹9,000 crore from “wilful defaulter” Vijay Mallya and his associated firms. SBI had moved DRT after the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines, owned by Mallya, accumulated thousands of crore in unserviced debt to tax and airport authorities, among others.
