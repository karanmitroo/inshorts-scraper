The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the government’s response on Vodafone’s plea against TRAI's recommendation to impose a ₹1,050 crore penalty on it for not providing interconnectivity to Reliance Jio. Vodafone claimed that while the Department of Telecom was concurring with it, TRAI was taking a different stand. Notably, similar recommendations were issued by TRAI against Airtel and Idea.
