Standard & Poor (S&P) downgraded the credit rating of Saudi Arabia to A-plus/A-1 with a negative outlook as the government expects a budget deficit close to 16% of GDP. Saudi's five year credit default swaps are at its peak since 2012. Sovereign wealth fund dipped by around 12% to $647 billion, as low oil prices are hurting the government's finances.
