The government is working on a proposal that will require retailers to report purchases above ₹6 lakh to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), according to reports. The proposal, targeted at preventing money laundering, will primarily apply to the purchase of luxury goods and jewellery, reports added. The government had banned cash transactions above ₹2 lakh in April last year.
