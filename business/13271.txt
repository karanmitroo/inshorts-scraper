Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday asked three state-run oil companies – BPCL, Indian Oil, and HPCL – to prepare for setting up the public sector’s largest oil refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex in western Maharashtra “before the end of 2017”. Pradhan cited the International Energy Agency's (IEA) recent estimate of a 233% increase in India’s oil demand by 2040.
