Tata Chemicals non-executive director Bhaskar Bhat has resigned from the company's board following disagreements with other members. This came after Tata Chemicals' independent directors "unanimously" backed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman. The independent directors made a statement "which did not take into account my views", Bhat said, adding he felt he could no longer contribute to the board.
