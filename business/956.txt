McDonald's north and east India licensee CPRL has said that 84 outlets, which were closed in December, will reopen by this weekend. The outlets, mostly in east India and some in the north, had to shut after logistics partner Radhakrishna Foodland discontinued its supply services. Vikram Bakshi-led CPRL, a 50:50 joint venture between him and McDonald's India, runs 169 outlets.
