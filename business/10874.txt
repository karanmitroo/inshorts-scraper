The benchmark Sensex on Thursday reclaimed the 27,000-mark after it rose 236.57 to close at 27,002.22 while the broader Nifty surged 66.75 points to settle at 8,270.45. The markets pared their initial losses amid firm European markets, and ahead of the UK's referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union, analysts said.
