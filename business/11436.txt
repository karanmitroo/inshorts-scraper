Power producer Adani Power on Monday said it has shut down four units of 660 MW capacity each out of the five units at its Tiroda power plant in Maharashtra due to acute water shortage. The Dhapewada Project in the state which supplies water to the plants has dried up leading to the units' shutdown, the company added.
