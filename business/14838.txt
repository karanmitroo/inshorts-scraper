Netflix is introducing an unlimited maternity and paternity leave policy, where it will allow employees to take time off as they like in the first year of giving birth or adopting a child. The company will not impose any pay cuts, intending to give them “flexibility... to balance the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or finances”.
