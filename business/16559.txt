Online retalier Snapdeal plans to tap 50 lakh low-income households in slums and villages across India. It will launch around 5,000 e-commerce kiosks across 65 cities and 70,000 rural areas by the end of 2015. "I am going into this thinking that we will be able to reach 5-10 crore new consumers in the next three years," Snapdeal co-founder said.
