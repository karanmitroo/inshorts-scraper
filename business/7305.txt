A Haridwar court on Wednesday slapped a fine of â‚¹11 lakh on Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurveda for putting up misleading advertisements about several newly launched products. It was guilty of claiming that the products were being produced by its own units, while they actually were manufactured somewhere else, the court said. The fine has to be paid within a month.
