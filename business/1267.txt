The World Bank announced on Tuesday that it will stop financing upstream oil and gas projects after 2019. The move is aimed at helping nations meet their targets of curbing greenhouse gas emissions as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The decision was reached at a climate summit held to raise funds to finance a shift towards clean energy.
