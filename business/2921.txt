Shares of Wanda Hotel Development, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Dalian Wanda Group, fell about 11% on Monday despite the group dismissing reports about billionaire Chairman Wang Jianlin being detained by authorities and barred from leaving China. Wanda Group said that "certain individuals with ulterior motives have recently created and spread various vicious rumours" regarding Jianlin.
