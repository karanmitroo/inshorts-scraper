Assisted by weaker equities and robust Chinese physical demand, gold extended its new year rally to a sixth session on Tuesday, pushing the yellow-metal to near three-week highs. Spot gold has gained nearly 4% in the past six sessions, after a 28% drop last year. Moreover, US gold futures also steadied after unusually sharp movements in the previous session.
