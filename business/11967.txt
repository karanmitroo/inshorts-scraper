The Supreme Court on Thursday directed liquor baron Vijay Mallya to disclose all assets held by him and his family. This came after a consortium of banks rejected Mallya's offer to repay â‚¹4,000 crore by September-end and demanded that he deposit a substantial amount upfront for any dialogue to commence. The court has scheduled the next hearing for April 26.
