Airlines on Thursday said tickets being sold using old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes will be "strictly non-refundable and won't be cancelled". "We got instructions from the DGCA to do so...This was not meant to be misused as a old-to-new note conversion trick," officials said. This followed reports of people buying airline tickets using their stack of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes.
