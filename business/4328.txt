Commenting on the need for institutional reforms, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, "You canâ€™t have a 21st century India with 19th century institutions." "Our view is that productivity levels must rise...and for that, the government must become a facilitator," Kant noted. Kant further said India has focussed on reforms of institutions like the Medical Council of India and UGC.
