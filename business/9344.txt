State-run BSNL will introduce lifetime free voice plans from 2017, Chairman and Managing Director Anupam Shrivastava has said, responding to Reliance Jio's entry into the telecom market. However, this service will cover both 2G and 3G users unlike Jio, which caters to only 4G subscribers, reports said. This plan will be cheaper than Jio's service, Shrivastava added.
