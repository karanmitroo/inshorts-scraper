With a 15.6% share in the fourth quarter, India based electronics company iBall has topped the tablet segment in the country, leaving behind Samsung (12.9% share), which dominated the segment for several years, according to IDC. This is another jolt for the Korean electronics major, which was recently bumped off the No. 1 spot in the smartphone segment by Micromax.
