Placing the biggest ever order for Rolls-Royce cars, a Hong Kong tycoon, on Tuesday, agreed to buy 30 Phantoms for his luxury Macau hotel-resort. Stephen Hung's purchase surpasses the 14 Phantoms bought by Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel in 2006. Without disclosing the total order value, Rolls-Royce said two of the cars will be the most expensive Phantoms ever commissioned.
