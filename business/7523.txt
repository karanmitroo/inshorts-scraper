Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday made it clear that rollout of GST was not optional and that it was a constitutional compulsion to have it in place before September 2017. "[O]therwise the country doesn’t run, and the tax is absolutely essential,” he added. Further, demonetisation, together with GST, will help grow the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), Jaitley said.
