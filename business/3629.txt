North Korea's economy accelerated at its fastest pace in 17 years, despite sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. The country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.9% in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to the Bank of Korea. The growth stemmed largely from mining and energy, as well as an increase in exports to China.
