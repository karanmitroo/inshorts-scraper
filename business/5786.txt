The British government faces a €2 billion fine (over ₹14,000 crore) for negligence that allowed criminal gangs to flood European black markets with illegal Chinese goods, EU anti-fraud investigators have said. France, Germany, Spain and Italy collectively lost €3.2 billion (over ₹22,000 crore) during 2013-2016 in VAT revenues, as a result of British failures in handling imports at its ports.
