Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's victory in 2016 US elections is "going to be an unlikely event in my opinion”. The US elections "will be settled in the next 48 hours and I expect it to be a fairly smooth ride,” he added. The election will be held on November 8.
