Global NCAP has reportedly asked Nissan to urgently withdraw Datsun Go model from India and related markets. Datsun Go got zero-star safety rating for adult occupant protection in a recent crash test by NCAP. “It is extremely disappointing that Nissan has authorized the launch of a brand new model that is so clearly substandard,” Max Mosley, Global NCAP chairman said.
