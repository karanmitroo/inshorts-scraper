The Indian rupee plunged 30 paise to as low as 68.86 on Thursday morning to hit an all-time low against the dollar. This follows the government's decision to demonetise old ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes. This also comes amid expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve under the newly elected US President Donald Trump.
