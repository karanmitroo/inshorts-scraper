Harsh Mariwala, Chairman of consumer goods giant Marico which owns brands like Saffola, said that Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali is the "most overhyped brand in India". Within a short period Patanjali covered products in every FMCG segment, but in most cases it's still struggling with a market share of 2-3%, Mariwala added. Recently, Patanjali hit an annual turnover of â‚¹10,000 crore.
