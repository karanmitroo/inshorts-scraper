Consumer goods giant Unilever has agreed to sell its margarine and spreads business to US private equity firm KKR for $8 billion. The unit employs 2,300 people around the world and owns the brands ProActiv, Flora, Rama and Country Crock. The move follows a review of Unilever's business which was prompted by an unsolicited takeover attempt by rival Kraft Heinz.
