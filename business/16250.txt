As the five-day strike of the Coal India workers entered into the second day Wednesday, the output loss caused by it is estimated to be Rs 300 crore. The strike has raised fears of a power crisis in the event of power plants running out of fuel. Over 75% of the daily coal output has been hit following the strike.
