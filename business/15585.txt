The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on Thursday ordered defunct Kingfisher Airlines to deposit Rs 25 lakh in the Consumer Welfare Fund following a case filed by a Delhi lawyer and NGO 'Consumer Voice' in 2008. The fine is for making fliers take the low-cost Deccan airline in spite of taking payments for the premier-service Kingfisher airline.
