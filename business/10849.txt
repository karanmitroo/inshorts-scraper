By promoting coastal shipping of six commodities including coal and steel, annual potential savings of around â‚¹40,000 crore can be made, according to government estimates. Coastal shipping of thermal coal alone could amount to about half of the estimated savings, an official said. The government expects to increase its share in waterways transportation from 7% to 10% by 2020.
