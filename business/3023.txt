Shares of IT giant Infosys tanked over 4% during intraday on Monday to a three-year low. Shares dropped despite a â‚¹13,000 crore share buyback offer the company announced earlier. The stock, which dropped nearly 10% on Friday, has been under continuous pressure following the abrupt exit of MD and CEO Vishal Sikka, and also faced downgrades from multiple brokerage firms.
