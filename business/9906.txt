US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker on Sunday said India's ambitious reforms, including the Goods and Services Tax and the liberalised FDI norms in key sectors, will boost trade relations with India. She added that US-India trade reached $109 billion in 2015, up from $37 billion in 2005. However, some business climate issues continue to raise concerns, she added.
