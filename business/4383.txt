Vodka giant Smirnoff has released a new ad trolling US President Donald Trump's alleged links with Russia. "The recent interest in American-made products created the perfect opportunity to reinforce that fact and the brand's roots in Russia with a wink and nod to current affairs," Smirnoff said. Notably, FBI is investigating Russia's alleged interference during the 2016 presidential election.
