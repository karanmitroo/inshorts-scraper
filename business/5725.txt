World Bank's Chief Economist Paul Romer has praised India's biometric identifier programme Aadhaar, stating, "The system in India is the most sophisticated that I’ve seen." "It’s the basis for all kinds of connections that involve things like financial transactions," he said. "It could be good for the world if this became widely adopted," Romer added.
