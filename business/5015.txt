The RBI has directed banks to accept notes, including new ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes, with colour and writings on them. RBI said these should be kept in the category of soiled notes and banks shouldn't refuse them. The bank issued the circular after it received complaints that branches were refusing notes with anything written on them or with external colour.
