Real estate firm DLF reported an over two-fold rise (107.6%) in its consolidated net profit to ₹261.42 crore for the quarter ended June. The jump in DLF's profits comes after it sold off its cinema business, DT Cinemas, to PVR, resulting in a one-time extraordinary gain of ₹372 crore. However, its revenue plunged 21.82% in the same period.
