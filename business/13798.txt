Deutsche Bank has, in a report, projected India’s “fiscal deficit for FY17 to be 3.8% of GDP, improving modestly thereafter to 3.7% of GDP in FY18". The report added that it would be difficult “to reduce the headline fiscal deficit (total budget deficit) to 3% of GDP by FY18, unless... supported by a strong pick-up in revenue, particularly tax revenue".
