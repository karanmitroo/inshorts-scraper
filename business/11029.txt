State-run NTPC has started trading its surplus energy from four of its thermal power stations at the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX). This comes after the government had, in January, allowed the state-owned firms to trade unrequisitioned power surplus. This power is traded at the IEX between the buyer and the seller for delivery on the next day.
