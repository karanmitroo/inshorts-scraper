Reliance Jio on Wednesday rejected allegations of generating a “tsunami” of traffic from its mobile network. "[O]utgoing traffic is less than 2 calls per customer per hour even during peak traffic period...operators are describing such a modest call rate as a tsunami of traffic,” it stated. Earlier, Airtel had asked TRAI to ensure networks are not “abused" by Jio's traffic.
