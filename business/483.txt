The RBI has kept the repo rate, the rate at which banks borrow from RBI, steady at 6% for the third time in a row during its sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review. This comes after retail inflation in December rose to a 17-month high of 5.21%. The RBI last cut the rate by 25 basis points in August last year.
