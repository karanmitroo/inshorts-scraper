Gold price in Delhi fell below the Rs. 27,000 mark, hitting a 14-month-low of Rs. 26,970 per 10 gram, on Saturday. The fall comes as a result of sustained selling by stockists amid a weak global trend and also due to the slackened demand from jewellers. The strengthening of the rupee against the dollar also influenced the yellow metal price.
