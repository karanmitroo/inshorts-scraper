In a huge setback to IT major Infosys, its director V Balakrishnan has resigned from the company. His resignation, which will be effective from Dec-31, 2013, is the eighth high-profile exit the company has seen since Narayana Murthy returned as chairman in June this year. Balakrishnan was also speculated by some as the next CEO of the company.
