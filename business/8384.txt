Asia's imports of crude oil from Iran in September have increased by 73% from the year-ago period, reports said. Asia's top buyers, India, Japan, China, and South Korea, imported 18 lakh barrels per day in September, they added. This comes after economic sanctions against Iran were lifted in January 2016, allowing it to export as much oil as it can.
