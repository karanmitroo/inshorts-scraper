The Centre’s UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All) scheme was on Saturday launched in Madhya Pradesh by CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal. Around three crore LED bulbs will be distributed over the next six months at ₹85 per bulb, Goyal said. Further, the state targets switching completely to LEDs in one-and-a-half years.
