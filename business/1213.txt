Indian domestic carriers have scrapped their flat ₹3,000 cancellation fee after regulator DGCA asked the airlines to provide data on cancellation charges. In accordance with DGCA rules, the charges will now be ₹3,000 or base fare plus fuel surcharge per passenger, whichever is lower. Earlier, Union Minister Jayant Sinha had raised concern over the domestic cancellation fee being extremely high.
