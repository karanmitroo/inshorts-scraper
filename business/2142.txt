The Supreme Court has said anyone creating "impediments" in the auction process of Sahara Group's Aamby Valley property would be held liable for contempt and "sent to jail". SEBI had claimed that Sahara Group was obstructing the auction by declaring a lockout at the property. However, the court clarified it was not initiating any contempt action at this stage.
