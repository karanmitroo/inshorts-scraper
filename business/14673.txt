Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said that the country's foreign reserves could be used to curb volatility in the Indian markets and a depreciation of the rupee. "We will have no hesitation in using our reserves when appropriate to reduce volatility in the rupee," Rajan said. The rupee is at its lowest since 2013.
