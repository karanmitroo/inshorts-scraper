Rising for the second session, the Indian rupee Thursday climbed by 50 paise to nearly four-week high of 62.67 against the greenback. The rupee firmed up against the US currency due to persistent selling of dollars by banks and hopes of capital inflows. On Wednesday, the Indian unit had closed at 63.17 to the dollar.
