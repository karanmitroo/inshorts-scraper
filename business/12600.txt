RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said that he was not in favour of devaluing the rupee exchange rates in order to boost the country's economic growth. However, the RBI will work towards curbing the excess volatility in the currency, he added. The rupee has reportedly been one of the worst performers in Asia this year, falling by nearly 3%.
