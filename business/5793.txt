Vijay Mallya, in a tweet, appealed to the Supreme Court to intervene to revive his one-time settlement offer to banks, stating he was "ready to talk settlement on fair basis”. Mallya said his offer was rejected without consideration. “Public sector banks have policies for one-time settlements. Hundreds of borrowers have settled. Why should this be denied to us?” he added.
