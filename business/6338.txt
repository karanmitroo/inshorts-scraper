An Air India pilot allegedly breached security protocol and flew a bird-hit plane carrying 122 passengers from Bhopal-Delhi on Monday. The flight was reportedly denied permission to land at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi for not following the standard operating procedure. An Air India spokesperson said it was diverted to Jaipur, where all the passengers deplaned safely.
