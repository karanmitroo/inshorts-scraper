McDonald's has terminated franchise agreement for 169 outlets in north and east India run by Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), adding the outlets cannot use its brand for operations. CPRL must cease using McDonald's name, trademark, and designs, among others, within 15 days of termination notice. This comes after 43 CPRL-run Delhi outlets were shut over non-renewal of eating house licences.
