The US has retained India on its Priority Watch List for intellectual property rights (IPR) for 2016 due to "lack of sufficient measurable improvements”. The US, however, acknowledged "positive steps forward on IPR protection and enforcement” undertaken by the Indian government in the last two years. Notably, Pakistan has been upgraded from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List.
