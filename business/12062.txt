The RBI on Wednesday relaxed the External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) norms to help firms raise overseas funds for infrastructure projects in India. Under the new guidelines, companies in the infrastructure sector will also be eligible to raise ECB, with a minimum average maturity period of five years. The companies can borrow a maximum of $750 million under the automatic route.
