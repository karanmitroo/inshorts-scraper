Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical and Ranbaxy Laboratories fell after the Andhra Pradesh high court Tuesday temporarily halted the proposed merger between the two companies until allegations of insider trading involving Sunâ€™s promoters are investigated. Silverstreet Developers, a Sun Pharma subsidiary, purchased a large volume of Ranbaxy shares just a few days before Sun and Ranbaxy announced a $3.2-billion merger deal.
