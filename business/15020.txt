The Civil Aviation Ministry is reportedly making efforts to secure about Rs 2,400 crore for Air India through supplementary budgetary allocations and recovery of dues. Around Rs 1,800 crore out of this amount will be used to fill the funding deficit faced by the national carrier. The airline will reportedly recover Rs 500-600 crore from various ministries for VVIP travel.
