An Air India employees' union has met NITI Aayog's Arvind Panagariya and demanded the government waive the airline's debt instead of selling it to a private player. Expressing concerns about the 25,000 employees, it has further demanded salary dues should be cleared before Air India is privatised. Notably, the government has given in-principle approval for disinvestment of Air India.
