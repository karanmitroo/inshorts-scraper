The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) said on Thursday that the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is now active and available for customers of 21 banks. The UPI is a payment interface that will facilitate users to initiate payment requests directly from a smartphone. The interface was soft-launched in April and was under pilot run to fix technical glitches.
