Wadia Group Chairman Nusli Wadia has written a letter urging markets regulator SEBI to take action against three independent directors of Tata Group companies. Wadia alleged that these directors had made wrong declarations in annual reports. Wadia has requested SEBI for a "full and impartial" investigation on the reports submitted by "illegal and unconstitutional" audit committees of those firms.
