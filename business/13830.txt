Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Friday reported a net profit of ₹4,842.02 crore for the quarter ended September, an 11% fall from ₹5,444.89 crore in the corresponding period last year. The company’s gain from the 95.6% drop in subsidy payout from ₹13,641 crore to ₹596 crore was offset largely by the global slump in crude oil prices.
