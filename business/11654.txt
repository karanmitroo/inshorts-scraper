Billionaire Carl Icahn, who disclosed his stake in Apple three years ago, revealed on Thursday that he sold his entire stake in the company. Icahn said he saw risks in Apple's relationship with China after it banned some of Apple's services. Icahn had shares worth $4.8 billion in February. Apple recently reported its first quarterly revenue fall in 13 years.
