The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has held that officials of real estate firms can be arrested for failing to hand over flats or make refunds on time. The Consumer Protection Act empowered the NCC to either order attachment of properties, or seek arrest, it added. The defaulter can not question the nature of order made under these provisions, NCC said.
