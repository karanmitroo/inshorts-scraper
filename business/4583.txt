Artist Alex Gardega has installed a urinating pug's statue as an act of defiance against the 'Fearless Girl' statue, erected in front of Wall Street's Charging Bull. The Fearless Girl statue was installed as a comment on gender inequality. However, Gardega said, “It has nothing to do with feminism, and it is disrespect to the artist that made the bull.”
