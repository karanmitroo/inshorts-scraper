Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani's wife Rohini Nilekani has said that a public pledge was needed because "the Indian wealthy aren't giving enough". She further said we must overcome our cultural barriers that giving should be a private and silent activity. The Nilekanis committed to donate half of their estimated $1.7 billion wealth to charity by joining 'The Giving Pledge' initiative.
