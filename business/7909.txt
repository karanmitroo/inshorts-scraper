Telecom regulator TRAI has sought views on a model for deployment of public Wi-Fi hotspots, including reselling of service by venue owners, that can be scaled up for wider coverage and affordable broadband services. Further, TRAI has proposed that malls, restaurant owners, and mobile wallet firms, among others can be a part of public Wi-Fi to reduce operations cost.
