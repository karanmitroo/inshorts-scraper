Bharti Airtel has cleared Rs. 6,796 crore of its debt (Rs. 63,839.5 crore as on March 31, 2013) by using the equivalent sum received by selling 5% stake to Qatar Foundation Endowment last month.  "This significant debt reduction will result in an improvement in the capital structure and balance sheet leverage for the Company," Airtel said.
