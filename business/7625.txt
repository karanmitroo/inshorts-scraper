Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has launched bond notes equivalent to US dollar, to be issued on Monday by the country's central bank. This comes after unrest in Zimbabwe as the government delayed state officials' salaries. The central bank said bond notes will ease currency shortages, but reports suggest it could encourage increased cash printing, similar to what happened in 2008.
