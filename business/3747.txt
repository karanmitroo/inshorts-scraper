Industrialist Gautam Adani's Adani Group issued defamation notice against The Economic and Political Weekly, a 50-year-old weekly academic journal. The case relates to a story by EPW on how the government allegedly bent rules for the group with regard to SEZs, which led to it earning tax refund worth â‚¹500 crore. The notice claimed the story was misleading and derogatory.
