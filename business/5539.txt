A bronze figure of a young girl facing down the famous 'Charging Bull' statue on Wall Street will remain there until 2018, it was announced. The 'Fearless Girl' was installed by State Street Global Advisors, in honour of International Women's Day to encourage companies to increase the number of women directors. It was originally supposed to stay for a month.
