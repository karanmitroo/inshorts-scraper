India has a historic second chance to disinvest in Air India and help propel the growth of aviation sector, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. Jaitley said he first proposed disinvestment in Air India in 1999 to government under then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. If 86% of flying can be handled by private sector, it can also handle 100%, Jaitley added.
