Nestle India’s new chief Suresh Narayanan has said the instant noodle brand Maggi will be back on retail shelves as soon as possible. Narayanan, who officially took charge of the company’s India operations Saturday, added that the company will also focus on dairy, chocolates and confectioneries to push growth. He, however, didn’t comment on the controversy over the Maggi ban.
