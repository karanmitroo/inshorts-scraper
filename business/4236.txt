Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal has said if Air India is to be privatised, then Tatas will be one of the better candidates to buy stake in the airline. His response came after reports suggested that Tata Group was interested in buying a controlling stake in the airline. Notably, Air India was originally owned by Tata before being nationalised in 1953.
