The Cellular Operators Association's Director General Rajan Mathews on Thursday rejected Reliance Jio’s demand for an apology for calling it a “Back Door Operator”. “I don’t believe there is any need for an apology," Rajan said, adding he acted in accordance with the association's constitution. He also ruled out an overhaul of COAI's voting norms, which Jio termed as biased.
