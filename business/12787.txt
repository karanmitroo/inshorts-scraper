The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), an indicator of the services industry’s economic health, hit a 19-month high of 54.3 in January, up from 53.6 in December. The increase in services' output was mainly driven by a seventh successive monthly growth of new business orders. The 50-mark on the PMI scale distinguishes business expansion from contraction.
