Indiaâ€™s external debt stood at $485.6 billion at 2016 March-end, recording an increase of $10.6 billion year-on-year, owing to an increase in outstanding NRI deposits, the RBI said on Thursday. However, the increase was partly offset by a valuation gain resulting from the appreciation of US dollar against the rupee. Commercial borrowings (37.3%) remained the largest component of external debt.
