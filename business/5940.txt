A special court has asked BJP MP Subramanian Swamy to bring more material in support of his criminal complaint against industrialist Ratan Tata in connection with the 2G spectrum scam. It also rejected Swamy's plea to direct the CBI to file a status report on its ongoing probe. Swamy alleged the CBI "purposely" left out Tata in the case.
