In a move to stop the rising prices of sugar, Maharashtra on Thursday issued an order that prohibits traders from holding more than 500 tonnes of the commodity. "Stock limit will deter speculators keen to hoard sugar," said the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association President. The centre had asked states last month to impose the limit to avoid hoarding.
