The BSE Sensex on Wednesday lost 274.28 points (1.08%) to close at 25,036.05 while the NSE Nifty fell 89.20 points (1.16%) to settle at 7,612.50. Analysts attributed the fall to dwindling hopes over passage of the proposed goods and services tax (GST) bill in the ongoing Parliament session, continued capital outflows by foreign funds and a slump in oil prices.
