The government on Friday decided to further extend the 25% tax imposed on wheat imports to curb the same due to rising domestic stockpiles despite drought. According to reports, the wheat stock at state-owned warehouses is at least 12 million tonnes above the government-set target for wheat inventory by July 1. The government had imposed the duty in March.
