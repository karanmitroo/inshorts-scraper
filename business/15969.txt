Snapping a surging trend in recent times, January coal imports declined 20% month-on-month, due to lower demand from domestic steel makers. According to mjunction, a Tata Steel and SAIL joint venture, January coal imports were down at 15.73 million tonnes from 19.75 MT in December. The imports, however, were up 2% from the 15.37 MT figure in the year-ago period.
