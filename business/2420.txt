Retail giant Walmart on Friday said it is testing a service in Silicon Valley to deliver groceries straight to customers' refrigerators. Walmart said it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and smart home accessories, to test the service. Delivery drivers will have a preauthorized OTP to unlock the house door and put groceries in the refrigerator.
