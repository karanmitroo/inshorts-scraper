The Cabinet will this week take up fixing February 1 as the date for the budget presentation after the Election Commission gave its nod, reports said. The Centre had consulted the EC as the former didn't want the presentation of Budget to clash with the state Assembly polls. Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Punjab, Manipur, and Uttarakhand go for polls in 2017.
