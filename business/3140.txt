The Bombay High Court on Monday put up Sahara's Aamby Valley resort town near Lonavala for public auction at a reserve price of ₹37,392 crore. Sahara Group pegs the market valuation of the project at over ₹1 lakh crore. The SC had ordered the auction of Aamby Valley in April, after Sahara failed to deposit dues to refund its investors.
