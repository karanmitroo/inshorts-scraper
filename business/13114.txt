According to Morgan Stanley, a rapid appreciation of the US dollar and further devaluation of the Yuan may push Brent crude prices to $20 a barrel. Brent crude prices fell nearly 10% last week and slipped to a 12-year low of $31.55 per barrel on Monday. Meanwhile, WTI crude settled at $31.41 per barrel, the lowest since December 2003.
