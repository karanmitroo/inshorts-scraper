Volkswagen’s sale of motorcycle brand Ducati currently has no majority board support. The sale is being resisted by Volkswagen's labour leaders on the board for lack of compelling financial reasons. Notably, Volkswagen's half yearly operating profit jumped 19% to €8.9 billion (₹67,000 crore) as cost cuts provided it relief from billions of euros in fines related to its emissions scandal.
