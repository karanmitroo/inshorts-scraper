Tobacco giant Imperial Brands has scrapped a new policy that could have given its CEO Alison Cooper a pay rise of around $3.8 million (₹25 crore). The tobacco firm admitted it faced anger from investors about the policy. Notably, the policy would have increased Cooper’s pay from $6.9 million to up to $10.7 million a year from increased bonus opportunities.
