A glitch at Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif allowed some users to buy cryptocurrencies for free. The glitch, which occurred last week and lasted for 18 minutes, affected Zaif's price calculation system. The exchange voided six trades after discovering the error and is trying to rectify the issue with the seventh customer who attempted to transfer the Bitcoin from the exchange.
