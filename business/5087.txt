Commenting on the incident of a passenger being dragged off a United Airlines flight, Dubai-based Emirates President Tim Clark said, "Let me say it was a disgrace. It shamed the airline industry as a whole." "We don't go about our business in that way," he added. Earlier, Emirates had taken out an ad which ridiculed United over the incident.
