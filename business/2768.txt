The RBI has told a parliamentary panel that it has "no information" on how much black money has been extinguished due to demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. RBI further said it has no information whether demonetisation is being planned to be implemented at regular intervals. RBI had earlier revealed nearly 99% of the scrapped notes returned to the system.
