Yoga guru Baba Ramdev has said that Patanjali Ayurved will finish the multinational firms in the Indian market in the next five years. Ramdev further said the MNCs were not working for the country's development, rather their sole objective was to "loot" India. In five years, Patanjali would educate farmers about latest techniques and also offer decent prices, he added.
