A US appeals court has renewed a case alleging that China's Alibaba Group Holdings defrauded shareholders in its Initial Public Offering (IPO). The lawsuit claims that the firm concealed a regulatory warning about counterfeiters received from the Chinese government before its 2014 IPO. Earlier, the US appeals court had ruled in favour of Alibaba to dismiss the claims against it.
