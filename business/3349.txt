Weight Watchers' CEO Mindy Grossman said Oprah Winfrey isn't the only reason for the company's rally, while pointing out improvements at the company. The company's stock on Friday jumped 25% to its highest closing price in four years after quarterly results. Winfrey, a long-time talk-show host, acquired 10% stake in the company in 2015, and also agreed to endorse it.
