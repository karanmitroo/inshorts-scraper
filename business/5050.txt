The Income Tax Department has issued a ₹24,646 crore tax demand notice to Sahara Group's Aamby Valley Limited. The department's audit found that an income of over ₹48,000 crore for the assessment year 2012-13 was not reflected in the record books of the firm. A week ago, the SC ordered Bombay HC to auction Sahara's Aamby Valley worth ₹34,000 crore.
