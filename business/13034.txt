Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out ₹3,483 crore from Indian equity markets during January 1-15. Indian debt markets, however, witnessed a net foreign inflow of ₹3,239 crore during the same period. Analysts attributed the outflow from the stock markets to several negative factors such as concerns over China’s growth, falling crude oil prices and weak industrial production data.
