Tata Steel may be considering breaking off talks over a planned merger of its European business with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, reports claimed. The merger talks had been revealed by Tata last year as part of a major restructuring of its UK steel business. Notably, such a deal could potentially lead to the formation of a European steel giant.
