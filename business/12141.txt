Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha on Tuesday said that 9.39 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been seeded with Aadhaar. â€œGovernment is linking bank accounts with Aadhaar to accurately transfer benefits", he added. His statement comes after the Parliament last week passed the Aadhaar Bill that aims at better targeting of subsidies through the Aadhaar unique identity number.
