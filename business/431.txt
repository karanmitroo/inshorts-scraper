Ride-hailing startup Uber has agreed to not use self-driving technology allegedly stolen from Google's self-driving unit Waymo to settle a trade secrets lawsuit. Uber will pay Waymo equity valued at about $245 million as part of the settlement, a spokesperson for Waymo said. A trial to decide the case, which started earlier this week, has been dismissed by the judge.
