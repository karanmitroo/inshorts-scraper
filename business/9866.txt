Future Group's Founder and CEO Kishore Biyani in a recent interview said, "I attempted e-commerce four times in my life." He added, "We started FutureBazaar way before Flipkart. We lost â‚¹300-350 crore in business." Biyani last year said, "Who's afraid of e-commerce? Even if you open 10 sites in 10 years, it'll be 10% of the total organised retail market."
