Air India Chairman and Managing Director Rajiv Bansal has said the airline will "act on those who fail to act" in ensuring on-time flights. Bansal said the value of "very good time slots" of Air India is lost if the flights do not operate on time. Air India, which operates nearly 400 flights everyday, has been facing flak for delays.
