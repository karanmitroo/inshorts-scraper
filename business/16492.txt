In a fresh blow to Vijay Mallya, the government has rejected an application filed by Kingfisher Airlines to reappoint him as the companyâ€™s managing director. The company had sought the central govt's approval for Mallya's reappointment for a period of five years beginning Oct-16, 2013 "without remuneration". Notably, the Airlines was grounded in Oct 2012 due to severe financial loss.
