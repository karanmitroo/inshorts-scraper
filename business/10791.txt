A government report tabled before Kerala assembly has said the state's financial situation is 'alarming' and a 20-25% annual hike in tax collection is needed over the next five years. State Finance Minister Thomas Issac attributed this to previous government's 'artificially-bloated' plan size. He cited increased spending on social sector, salaries, pensions and interest payments as other reasons.
