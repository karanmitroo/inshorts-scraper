The government is reportedly planning to make all the payments made to industrial workers cashless, asking employers to either provide a cheque or make deposits directly into workers' accounts. Workers with wages not exceeding â‚¹18,000 per month are said to be covered under the new rule. The move would also help reduce workers' grievances regarding non-payment of minimum wages.
