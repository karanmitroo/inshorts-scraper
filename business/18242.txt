Apple will sell iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C from November-1 in India. The prices of these devices are expected to be Rs.40000 for iPhone-5C and over Rs.50000 for iPhone-5S(16GB variants). Apple promised free personal setup-service to those buying these models but it is not certain if it would happen in India, since Apple doesn't operate any retail store here.
