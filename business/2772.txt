Cement major ACC was asked to redeposit ₹16.7 crore to the GST Network (GSTN), despite the amount being deducted, after GSTN cited a difference of ₹1. Following this, Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has said the matter has been taken up with the GSTN. Meghwal assured that no penalty would be imposed on ACC since it was a technical glitch.
