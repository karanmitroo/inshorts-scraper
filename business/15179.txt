Zimbabwe on Thursday discarded its virtually worthless national currency and will soon start exchanging it for US dollars. Interestingly, 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars will fetch only one US dollar. The southern African country started using foreign currencies like the US dollar and South African rand in 2009. And, the country will now completely switch to foreign currencies by September.
