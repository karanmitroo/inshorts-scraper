EU's Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger has said that Britain's withdrawal from the bloc could leave a €20 billion hole in its budget. While Brexit could cause a gap of up to €11 billion a year, it may double owing to an increase in spending on defence and security, he added. Notably, Britain was asked to pay a €100-billion Brexit bill.
