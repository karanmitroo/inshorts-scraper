The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it's not clear under what authority the Enforcement Directorate (ED) went to search Nirav Modi's properties. The court has issued a notice to ED after Nirav Modi's Firestar Diamond filed a plea against the seizure of its properties. The judge hearing the plea called the matter "sketchy" since exact facts are not known.
