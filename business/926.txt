SEBI has banned Price Waterhouse firms from auditing listed companies in India for two years over its alleged role in Satyam scam. In 2009, Satyam founder Ramalinga Raju had admitted to inflating books by over ₹7,000 crore. The regulator also ordered to give up ₹13 crore of wrongful gains with interest from the auditing firm and its two erstwhile partners.
