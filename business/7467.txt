BJP President Amit Shah on Tuesday asserted that by 2016-end, India will become free of black money. He claimed black money will not survive, because if left in homes it will become junk and if deposited in banks it will be taxable. Demonetisation has “changed the rules” for parties as black money will now be out of elections, he added.
