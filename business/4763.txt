In a "Safety Alert" email, United Airlines on Saturday warned employees that "cockpit door access information may have been made public" and security codes "compromised" by mistake. United spokesperson Maddie King said this was not a hack or breach, and the Federal Aviation Administration was informed. Sharing "sensitive information" with anyone unauthorised is prohibited, United reminded staff.
