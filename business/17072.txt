Aadhaar card is now set to become the single universal document for opening a bank account ousting the age-old ration card, according to  Jul-17 RBI circular. The "officially valid documents" are Aadhaar, voter ID, PAN, driving licence, passport, and NREGA card. While other documents canâ€™t be used by all types of customers, Adhar is the most appropriate option.
