Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said only 2% of India's GDP comes from personal income tax. Claiming it to be "abysmally low", Adhia said this is probably the lowest in the world. There are only 76 lakh people showing income of over â‚¹5 lakh, he stated, adding that increasing the share of personal income tax would be a "big challenge".
