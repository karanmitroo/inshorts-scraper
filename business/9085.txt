Describing South Asia as a global growth hotspot, the World Bank has said that India's GDP growth will remain strong at 7.6% in 2016 and 7.7% in 2017. The growth will be supported by expectations of a rebound in agriculture, pay reforms, positive contributions from exports, and a medium-term growth in private investment, the global development bank added.
