India recorded an average annual economic growth rate of 8% during the 11th Five-Year-Plan (2007-12) compared to targeted 9%, Parliament was informed Thursday. Planning Minister Rajeev Shukla said that shortfall in meeting targets can be attributed to global slowdown, fluctuations in international prices, and negative growth in agriculture. Shukla added that steps have been undertaken to address the growth slowdown.
