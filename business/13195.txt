Bicycle-manufacturer Hero Cycles on Monday said that the company sold over 6 lakh units in December 2015, the highest ever monthly sales recorded by any cycle company in India. The sales which represent a 20% growth year-on-year were fuelled by "strong sales in rural and semi-urban areas, and strong growth in the premium cycles segment", the company said.
