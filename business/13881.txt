The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on Thursday reported a 3.9% month-on-month increase in its global food price index (led by a 17.2% jump in sugar prices) in October, the sharpest rise since July 2012. The index measures monthly changes in the prices of dairy, cereals, sugar, oilseeds, and meat. However, food prices in international markets declined 16% year-on-year.
