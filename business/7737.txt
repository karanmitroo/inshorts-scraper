Former Chief of TCS FC Kohli on Wednesday denied ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry's claim that Ratan Tata had tried to sell TCS to IBM. Mistry's office on Tuesday had said that TCS faced a "near-death experience" at the hands of Ratan Tata. Mistry had also alleged that Ratan Tata's ego put thousands of jobs at risk.
