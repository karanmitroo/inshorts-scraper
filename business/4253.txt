Shares of Japanese airbag maker Takata lost nearly 50% of their value in just three days. This comes after reports suggested that Takata might file for bankruptcy protection and sell its assets. Earlier, 10 crore cars were subjected to airbag recalls, largest in the auto industry, over defective Takata airbags, which have been blamed for 16 deaths globally.
