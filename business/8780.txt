ICICI Bank's shares on Monday rose by 7.32%, the maximum rise in six months, amid expectations that sale of Essar Oil will help Essar group lower its debt. It has exposure to Essar group, whose weak financial conditions raised concerns over asset quality, analysts said. Notably, Essar Oil sold its 98% stake to Russia's Rosneft-led consortium for nearly $13 billion.
