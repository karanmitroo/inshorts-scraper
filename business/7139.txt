Iran on Sunday said it had negotiated to pay only about half the announced price for 80 new Boeing airliners in a deal the plane-maker said was worth $16.6 billion. Boeing and rival Airbus have both signed contracts with Iran this month. These are the first such deals since international sanctions were lifted to curb Tehran's nuclear programme.
