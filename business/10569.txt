US Department of Justice on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against US-based Goldman Sachs' work with Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB amid allegations of fund diversion by 1MDB officials for personal use. Goldman Sachs had helped raise $6.5 billion to invest in the Malaysian economy. However, over $2.5 billion were diverted towards artwork, gambling debts, and luxury properties, the lawsuit said.
