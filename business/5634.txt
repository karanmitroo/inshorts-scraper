The government on Tuesday proposed to make Aadhaar card mandatory for filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) for all those who submit their returns after July 1, 2017. Further, Aadhaar number would also be needed while applying for a Permanent Account Number (PAN). According to the proposed bill, PAN cards that are not linked to Aadhaar will be deemed invalid.
