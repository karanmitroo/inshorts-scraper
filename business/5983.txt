Manyata Business Park in Bengaluru, which houses companies like Nokia, Cognizant, and IBM, has converted part of its campus into a garden to let employees grow their own food. About 15 acres of land has been divided into 170 mini-gardens, which are allotted to employees free of cost. Produce grown on the land can be taken home by the employees.
