The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration has raided online retailer Snapdeal's Mumbai office after complaints that the company was selling prescription drugs without proper licence. Ascoril cough syrup and Vigora tablets were available for sale on the company website. As per Drugs & Cosmetics Act, only a licensed retailer can sell these drugs on the basis of a doctor's prescription.
