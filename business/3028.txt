Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson may cut around 25,000 jobs, equivalent to over 22% of its entire global workforce, according to a media report. The company will be introducing phased job cuts as part of its ongoing cost savings programme, the reports added. Ericsson said it was "too early to talk about specific measures or exclude any country".
