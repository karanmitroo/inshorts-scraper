Tech firm IBM on Tuesday reported its lowest quarterly revenue in 14 years for the quarter ended March at $18.68 billion, down 4.6% from the year-ago period. Notably, this is the company's 16th consecutive quarterly revenue decline. Revenue fall in IBM's traditional businesses like hardware was dwarfing the revenue rise from "strategic imperatives" like cloud and mobile computing, analysts said.
