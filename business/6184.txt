US President Donald Trump on Tuesday lifted anti-corruption rules which forced oil companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments to secure mining and drilling rights. The regulations were a part of financial reforms passed by the Barack Obama administration after the 2008 financial crisis. The oil industry had opposed the rules claiming they gave global rivals a competitive edge.
