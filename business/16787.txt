Nokia on Tuesday said it will shut down its Chennai plant. "In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility from 1st November," Nokia said. In September 2013, Nokia announced it would sell its devices and services (D&S) business including its assets in India to Microsoft for $7.2 billion by March 2014.
