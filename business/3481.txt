Minister of State for Finance Santosh Gangwar has said that shifting the financial year from April-March cycle to January-December will not happen next year. He said that in order to do so, the government needs to present the Union Budget in November, which doesn't seem possible. Notably, the April-March financial year was adopted in 1867 to align with British government.
