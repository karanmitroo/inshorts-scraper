SBI on Wednesday slashed interest rates on loans for cars (by 0.20% to 10.55%) and consumer durables and also reduced the processing charges, following the government's decision to pump in funds in PSU banks so that they could lower rates to stimulate demand in the targeted sector. Special festive loans for SBI's salary account holders are also available.
