Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das on Monday said half the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) amount of private and government companies should be transferred to the state government. This money would then be spent on the upliftment of the poor. Notably, companies with over ₹1,000 crore turnover or ₹5 crore net profit have to spend 2% of their profit on CSR activities.
