JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon announced Tuesday that he has throat cancer but will remain on the job as he seeks treatment. "The good news is that the prognosis from my doctors is excellent, the cancer was caught quickly, and my condition is curable," Dimon said in a letter. He expects the 8-week treatment to start soon in New York.
