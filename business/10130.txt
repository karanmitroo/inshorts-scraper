Power Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday urged investors to bring advanced technologies and “meticulous planning” to the electricity industry in India, which needs $2.5 trillion to curb pollution from fossil fuels. As part of its climate pledge to the United Nations in November, India plans to increase the amount of non-fossil-fuel power to 40% from around 30% by 2030.
