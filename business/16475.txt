E-retailer Amazon Thursday launched its own brand of diapers, directly challenging the vendors already selling on its website. The first products in its new Amazon Elements line of consumer products would be diapers and baby wipes; other "premium" everyday consumer products would soon follow, Amazon said. The Elements line is available only to members of Amazon's Prime $99-a-yr subscription club.
