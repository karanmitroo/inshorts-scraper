The RBI on Wednesday gave in-principle approval to the common service centres (CSCs) in rural areas to collect payments for services like electricity, water and gas. The facility will be rolled out within around three months, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. CSCs are physical facilities meant for the delivery of e-services of the government in rural and remote locations.
