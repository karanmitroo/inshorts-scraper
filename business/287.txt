The Co-founder of Ethereum platform and cryptocurrency, Vitalik Buterin, has warned that cryptocurrencies "could drop to near-zero at any time" as they are "a new and hyper-volatile asset class". "Don't put in more money than you can afford to lose," he added. He further said that traditional assets are still the "safest best" to store one's life savings.
