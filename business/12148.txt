Swiss bank Credit Suisse said it’s cutting 2,000 jobs in its markets division as its CEO said he wasn’t aware of the size of the risky investments that the bank was exposed to by some of its traders. Market analysts expect the bank’s revenue from trading to fall by up to 45% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2016.
