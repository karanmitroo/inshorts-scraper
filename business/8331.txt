Volkswagen's supervisory board is set to hold an 'extraordinary meeting' on November 4 over the restructuring of the carmaker's brand, reports claimed. This comes amid the management and labour leaders seeking to agree on matters like cutting costs and investments. The supervisory board is also scheduled to meet on November 18 to ratify the group's spending plans through 2021.
