Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said, "If you are a cashless society, crimes will still take place, but cash is the biggest facilitator of crime.” “We were a high cash economy and this economy leads to tax evasion, corruption, and a parallel economy," he added. Jaitley further said lakhs and crores of money has been returned to RBI post demonetisation.
