UK inflation rose to 1%, recording its highest level in over two years in September, despite evidence of a weaker pound pushing up prices, official data revealed on Tuesday. This was against 0.6% in August, marking the biggest jump from one month to the next since June 2014. The surge was attributed to increase in clothing prices and fuel costs.
