A consortium of banks led by the SBI on Monday told the Supreme Court that without the disclosure of liquor baron Vijay Mallya's assets, it was not possible to assess his capacity to pay their outstanding dues. Earlier, Mallya had told the apex court that he is willing to pay ₹6,868 crore of the ₹9,000 crore owed to the banks.
