A Delhi-bound Air India flight with 168 people on board was grounded after developing a technical glitch for the second time on Monday. A Goa Airport official said, "the flight... initially developed a technical problem and had to come back before taking off." The flight later took off believing the problem was fixed but returned when the problem prevailed.
