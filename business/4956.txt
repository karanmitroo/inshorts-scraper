India's third largest IT firm Wipro has replaced its multi-coloured sunflower logo, which was introduced in 1998, with a new one. The new logo comprises dots, which according to Wipro, represent the way the company "connects the dots" for its clients. "Our re-articulated values connect and resonate deeply with the new, vibrant, brand identity," Wipro Chairman Azim Premji said.
