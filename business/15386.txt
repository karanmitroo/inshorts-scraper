Gold prices soared by Rs 315 to reach Rs 27,565 per 10gms and silver surged by Rs. 700 to conclude at Rs. 38,500 per kg at the bullion market. This level in gold was last seen three months ago, and is attributed to the firm global trends and declining equity market. The wedding season has further contributed to the rise.
