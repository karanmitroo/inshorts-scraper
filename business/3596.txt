German carmaker BMW has rejected reports that it cheated emissions tests through illegal systems in its cars. The company also denied reports of plotting with Audi, Volkswagen, and Porsche on designs of diesel emissions treatment systems. Vehicle emissions came under scrutiny worldwide since Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to installing illegal software to cheat US emissions tests on diesel cars.
