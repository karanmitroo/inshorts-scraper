The reports of the introduction of new income tax slabs are "baseless" and "unfounded", Government spokesperson and Press Information Bureau chief Frank Noronha said on Monday. Attributing to a possible revision of tax slabs post demonetisation, reports had earlier suggested that "new" income tax slabs would grant 100% tax relief to people with income less than â‚¹4 lakh.
