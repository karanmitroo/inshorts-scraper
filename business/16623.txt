Gold prices on Wednesday dropped by Rs 450 to trade at over 3-year low of Rs 25,900 per 10 grams (in Delhi) led by the low demand from jewellers. Dollar's strength also dampened demand for the yellow metal. Silver also recorded a steep fall of Rs 900 to Rs 35,050 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
