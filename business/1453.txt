Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories said it has been served a class action lawsuit in the US for alleged violation of federal securities laws. The lawsuit alleged the company made materially false and misleading statements in connection with its corporate quality system. The firm said the asserted claims are "without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegation".
