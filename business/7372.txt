US President-elect Donald Trump has said that business-focused newspaper The Wall Street Journal doesn’t “get” his plans. "I read the Wall Street Journal the other day," he said, adding, "Honestly, their editorial board doesn't get it. I don't think they understand business." Earlier, Trump vowed to impose a 35% tax on products sold inside US by businesses that moved abroad.
