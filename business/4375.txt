The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will introduce a new batch of ₹500 currency notes, which will have inset letter 'A'. However, old notes, which were introduced following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move, will continue to remain legal tender. The note will bear the signature of RBI Governor Urjit Patel and will have the year of printing ‘2017’.
