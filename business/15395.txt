E-commerce giant Flipkart is planning the use of drones to deliver goods in rural areas, said Binny Bansal, the companyâ€™s chief operating officer. The company is looking to convince the government for the move, as last year the centre had banned the use of drones after a pizza joint in Mumbai experimented with the unmanned airborne mini-vehicles.
