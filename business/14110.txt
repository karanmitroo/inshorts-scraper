The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday warned that Saudi Arabia, worldâ€™s biggest oil exporter, risks draining financial assets in under five years amidst falling oil prices, if the government maintains its current policies. IMF forecast a fiscal deficit of 20% of its GDP for Saudi Arabia this year and over $700 billion overall for Gulf Countries between 2015-2019.
