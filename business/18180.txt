Civil aviation ministry is likely to complete the process of privatizing six major airports -Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, and Guwahati- before the 2014 general elections, said Civil aviation secretary KN Shrivastava. Shrivastava added that the ministry would incorporate valid suggestions by stake holders and change accordingly the requests for qualification(RFQ) and other documents so as to avoid issues later.
