Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy on Thursday said noted banker K V Kamath and former board members Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan played a "role" in his return to Infosys. Murthy, who retired in August 2011, was called back in June last year to take charge of Infosys, which has lagged behind industry peers like TCS and HCL Technologies.
