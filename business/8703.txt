The country's largest lender, State Bank of India and its subsidiary banks have blocked about 6.25 lakh debit cards over "suspicious" transactions at third-party ATMs, SBI CTO Shivkumar Bhasin has said. The bank has subsequently alerted the customers about the malware and has asked them to re-apply. Debit cards of other banks have also been affected, an official said.
