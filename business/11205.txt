Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on Monday said it has entered into a brand licence agreement with Italian car designer Pininfarina for using trademarks owned by the latter. The announcement was made as M&M closed the deal to acquire a 76.06% stake in the Turin-based company along with its subsidiary Tech Mahindra, which had been announced in December last year.
