Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, has paid $45 million (â‚¹290 crore) in sexual harassment settlements since mid-2016. The expenses were for "settlements of pending and potential litigations," following the departure of former CEO Roger Ailes in July 2016 amid sexual harassment allegations. Fox recently parted ways with anchor Bill O'Reilly after he was also accused of sexual harassment.
