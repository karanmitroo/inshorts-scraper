US-based Goldman Sachs will cut nearly 30% of its investment banking jobs in Asia outside Japan due to a slowdown in the region's activity, reports stated. It would be reducing the number of bankers working on mergers and acquisitions, and equity and debt markets deals. Most cuts would be in its main Asian offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China.
