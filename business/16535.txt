The rupee dropped to a nine-month low against the US currency (Dollar-$) in late morning deals on Thursday. Dealers said, strengthening dollar overseas and higher importers' demand weighed heavily on the rupee movement. The Indian unit resumed lower at 62.03 per dollar as against the Wednesday's closing level of 61.96. Later, it depreciated sharply to a nine-month low.
