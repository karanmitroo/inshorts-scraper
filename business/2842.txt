Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday indicated that the number of tax slabs under the GST regime could be reduced once the new indirect tax system settles down. He further said the GST Council which takes decisions on all indirect tax matters may consider the idea of collapsing the standard rates of 12% and 18% into one in due course.
