Capital market regulator (SEBI) on Tuesday tightened disclosure norms for Indian credit rating agencies in a bid to boost transparency and accountability. Rating agencies will now be required to publicly provide details of the criteria and process behind rating changes and review each criteria periodically, SEBI said. The new guidelines need to be implemented within the next 60 days.
