Peter's Food Service, which supplies pastries to supermarkets ASDA and Lidl in the UK, has recalled its pastry products amid fears they may contain glass pieces. A Lidl spokesperson said they were notified about "a glass breakage from a light bulb during manufacturing". Those who purchased the products were urged to return them to stores, and not to consume them.
