Air Passengers' Association has called the government's proposed draft rules on no-fly list "vague" and "hurriedly prepared". "The different categories of unruly behaviour have not been properly defined. The language is very vague," it said. "If you say a physical gesture is a level one offence then the rules must clearly explain what constitutes an offensive gesture," it added.
