The IT sector is expected to create 2.5 lakh jobs in 2016, an increase of 14-16% over the previous year, a Teamlease Services report said. The rise is reportedly due to the increased focus on digitisation, entrepreneurial activity and a shift from being service providers to solution providers. The digital marketing profile itself is expected to see over 70,000 openings.
