Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio on Thursday temporarily halted the Jio Prime sign-up process. In a message to users, Jio stated that the glitches were due to "unprecedented load" on its servers. Some users reported that they were able to make the transactions, and money was deducted from their cards but Jio service displayed that the sign-up had failed.
