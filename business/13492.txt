Paris-based think tank Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Tuesday said that it anticipates “firming growth” in the Indian economy. In comparison, “tentative signs of stabilisation are emerging” in Brazil and China, “the outlook continues to be for weak growth momentum” in Russia, and “the UK and the US show a loss of growth momentum”, OECD added.
