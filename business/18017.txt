The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to Centre, RBI, Enforcement Directorate and a dozen major charted accounting firms on a PIL alleging massive bungling by them and demanding a probe into it. The PIL alleged that these firms, including Price waterhouse Coopers (PwC), are flouting IT Act, FEMA, RBI regulations as well as massive evasion of tax.
