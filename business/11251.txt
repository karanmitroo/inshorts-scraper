The Centre has asked the state governments to submit a report on utilisation of funds of the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for 2015-16 by June-end, an official release said.  The states should ensure transfer of grants to the ULBs within 15 days of receipt from the Centre, failing which an interest should be paid on the delays, it further said.
