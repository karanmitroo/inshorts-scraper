India has extended a new $750 million line of credit for post-earthquake reconstruction projectsâ€‹ in Nepal, the government said on Saturday. India had already announced $1 billion in aid after the earthquake that claimed over 8,000 lives in Nepal last year. This comes amidst delegation-level talks between PM Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
