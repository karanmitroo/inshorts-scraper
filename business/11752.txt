The government will invite bids for developing eight rivers as inland waterways within a month, an Inland Waterways Authority official said. This comes after the Parliament passed the Inland Waterways bill last month that would enable the conversion of 106 rivers into national waterways. Works have also been initiated to make the existing five waterways operational, the official added.
