An exclusive Wu-Tang Clan album that "pharma bro" Martin Shkreli bought for $2 million (₹12.8 crore) in 2015, might not be an official Wu-Tang release. "It's not an authorised Wu-Tang Clan album," said Domingo Neris, a member of the Clan. Notably, Shkreli has put his exclusive copy for sale on eBay, with the current bid at over ₹6.4 crore.
