Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das today said that the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) using the Aadhar card for fertiliser and food subsidy, will soon be implemented. This comes a day after the Lok Sabha approved a bill providing statutory status to Aadhaar. Currently, the unique identity number is primarily being used for transfer of LPG subsidy and other government programmes.
