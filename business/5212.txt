The staff of a Russian newspaper, who documented the alleged rounding up of gay men in a Chechen concentration camp, have received threats of "retribution". The newspaper had described how around 100 men have been detained in the camp, leaving at least three dead. The newspaper's editors said they had “serious concerns for the safety of Novaya Gazeta’s entire staff".
