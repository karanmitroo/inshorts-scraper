Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Saturday announced he'll be selling around 75 million Facebook shares in 18 months, which are currently valued at $12.8 billion, to fund his philanthropic initiatives. He also asked the Facebook board to drop his earlier proposal of creating a new class of shares that would let him fund his initiatives and retain Facebook's voting control.
