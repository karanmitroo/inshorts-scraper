The countryâ€™s second largest low-fare airline SpiceJet cut airfares on Tuesday by 50% for booking for three days on or before Jan-23. However, a minimum of 30 days advance purchase is a must for availing the discount. The move is expected to improve the load factor of the airlines during the off-season.
