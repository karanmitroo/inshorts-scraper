Airtel on Thursday claimed it has suffered a loss of ₹6,800 crore in the last five years due to low Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC) set by TRAI. Airtel's response came after Reliance Jio earlier claimed that India's top three telecom firms had generated up to ₹1.04 lakh crore in revenue in the past five years in excess IUC.
