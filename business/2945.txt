The Infosys board has termed past differences with Co-founder Narayana Murthy as "unfortunate". "The board wishes to express that it was not its intention to cause Murthy or any other affected person any personal distress or anguish while stating its point of view," it added. Earlier, Infosys said that Murthy's "continuous assault" was the primary reason behind Vishal Sikka's exit.
