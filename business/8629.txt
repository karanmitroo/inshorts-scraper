Canada-based Bombardier said on Friday that it would cut additional 7,500 jobs following extended delays and budget overruns in its aerospace business. About two-thirds of these jobs are in Bombardier Transportation, the firm's Germany-based rail unit which had already sacked about 3,500 workers. Bombardier, which ended 2015 with 70,900 employees, had said it would lay off 10% workers by 2018.
