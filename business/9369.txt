US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left the key interest rate unchanged at 0.25-0.50% for the sixth straight time. The central bank's policy-setting committee said the case for a federal rate change has strengthened, but it would wait for "further evidence of continued progress" to change the rates. Notably, banks lend money to other institutions based on the Federal Reserve rates.
