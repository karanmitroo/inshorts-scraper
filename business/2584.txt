The US national debt has surpassed $20 trillion for the first time ever after President Donald Trump signed a bill temporarily raising the nation's debt limit for three months. This amounts to almost $62,000 per person in the United States and over $167,000 per tax payer. Notably, the debt has increased about $215 billion since Trump's inauguration.
