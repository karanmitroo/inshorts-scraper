Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday claimed India's economy slowed down due to "hasty" implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) soon after demonetisation. Addressing a public meeting organised by the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), Singh added that the Congress supported the idea of GST, but it would have implemented it after due care and adequate preparation.
