Japanese auto maker Toyota may withdraw the Etios brand from the Indian market by stopping its production by 2020 and introduce Vios, a sedan, by 2017. Launched just four years ago, Toyota is unable to gain much traction with the budget Etios. Vios which will aim at middle-class drivers, will compete with the company’s arch-rival Honda’s City.
