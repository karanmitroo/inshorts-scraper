Cisco Systems on Tuesday announced it would buy privately held cloud-based security firm OpenDNS for a sum of $635 million. The move is seen as an attempt by Cisco to boost its security business amid increasing cyber attacks and growing concerns over internet security. A group including Cisco had invested $35 million in OpenDNS in May last year.
