A Spanish worker at the supermarket chain Lidl is suing the company after he was allegedly sacked for working too many hours. A tribunal heard that the man had arrived at work early multiple times but failed to record his arrival, thereby breaching rules. He allegedly violated company's rules on unpaid overtime and for being in the store alone.
