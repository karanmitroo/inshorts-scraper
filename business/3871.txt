Billionaire investor and world's fourth richest person Warren Buffett made his annual summer donation, gifting Berkshire stock worth over $3.17 billion (over ₹20,400 crore) to charity. The sum is Buffett’s biggest-ever summer donation, topping last year’s $2.86 billion (over ₹18,000 crore) gift. The record donation was due to the rising value of Berkshire's share price over the past year.
