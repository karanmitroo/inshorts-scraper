United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz has refused to apologise after the airline was slammed over a passenger being dragged off an overbooked flight. In a letter to employees, he said he was "upset," adding that he "emphatically" stands behind his employees and that the passenger "defied" officers. Further, crew members have claimed the passenger was "disruptive and belligerent."
