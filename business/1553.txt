Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said the government may combine the 12% and 18% GST slabs into one in the near future, and reserve 28% rate only for demerit goods. However, he added that India will never move to a single GST rate and there would be a "poor man's" rate of 0-5% and a "core" rate of between 12-18%.
