Google's parent company Alphabet has awarded its search engine unit's CEO Sundar Pichai restricted stock worth about $199 million, making it the biggest award ever given to a Google executive. Reportedly, the shares will vest in quarterly increments through 2019 if Pichai remains on the job. Equity awards are typically granted to Google executives once every two years.
