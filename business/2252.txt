Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej has said the Indian economy is doing much better than what is being generally perceived. He said the growth rate was "reasonable" in April and May, but slipped in June due to destocking ahead of the GST rollout. He also said that people should wait and see as GST will add significant value to GDP.
