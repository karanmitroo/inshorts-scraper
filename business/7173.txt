Tata Sons interim Chairman Ratan Tata has said that “these days are very lonely” because of “unsubstantiated” yet "very painful” attacks against him and the Tata Group. “There has been a definite move to damage my personal reputation and the reputation of...the Tata group," he said. He further added that whatever the process may be, "the truth will prevail".
