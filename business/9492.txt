Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos has once again overtaken Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett to become the world's third-richest​ person with a net worth of $66.5 billion. Bezos went ahead of Buffett due to the Wells Fargo’s fake account scandal, which pushed Buffett’s net worth down to $66 billion. Buffett and his company Berkshire Hathaway own shares in Wells Fargo.
