A former Morgan Stanley employee Bernard Mourad has told a tribunal that bonus of $1.5 million (nearly â‚¹10 crore) was unfairly withheld after he brought in over $100 million in fees. Bank argued Mourad knew the compensation was designed to "reward loyalty" tied to his continued presence. Mourad who left the bank in 2015 considered himself "a good leaver".
