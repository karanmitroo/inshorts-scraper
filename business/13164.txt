The World Bank on Wednesday projected India to be the worldâ€™s fastest growing economy, growing at 7.8% in 2016 and 7.9% in the two subsequent years. "In contrast to other major developing countries, growth in India remained robust, buoyed by strong investor sentiment and the positive effect on real incomes of the recent fall in oil prices," the lender said.
