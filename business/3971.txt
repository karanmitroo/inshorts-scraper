Virgin Group's billionaire Founder Richard Branson has slammed Donald Trump's policies, including travel ban against certain nationals from six Muslim-majority countries, calling it "unhealthy and dangerous". He further criticised Brexit, saying what happened with it is "a terrible, terrible thing for Great Britain and Europe and will set back Great Britain and may take several years to recover".
