The World Bank on Friday announced a new programme Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) to mobilise funds quickly against virulent disease outbreaks in the world's 77 least developed countries. The PEF, a combination of insurance and bonds, is a reaction to the sluggish donor response to the recent outbreak of Ebola in Africa, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said.
