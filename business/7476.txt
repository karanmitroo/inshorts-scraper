Danish toymaker Lego is going to appoint its first foreign CEO Bali Padda under an organisational shake-up that will see the current CEO JÃ¸rgen Vig Knudstorp step down by year end. Knudstorp will now become the Chairman of the company. He led the company through a turnaround since his appointment in 2004, a year after Lego was near bankruptcy.
