The I-T Department on Wednesday urged taxpayers to link Aadhaar with their PAN using an SMS-based facility. It issued advertisements in dailies and described how both unique identity numbers can be linked by sending an SMS to either 567678 or 56161. The department said linking the two numbers is key to "seamlessly avail online, a world of income tax facilities."
