Gurugram-based airline SpiceJet on Saturday reported a 43% fall in net profit at â‚¹41.6 crore for the quarter ended March due to lower yield on account of demonetisation and increased fuel costs. This was SpiceJet's ninth successive profitable quarter. In January, SpiceJet announced it will buy up to 205 aircraft from Boeing in one of Indian aviation sector's largest deals.
