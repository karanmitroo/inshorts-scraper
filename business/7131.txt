PM Narendra Modi has said that advancing the date of budget presentation would help getting funds authorised for different sectors at the start of the fiscal. A change in the budget cycle would have an impact on the real economy, he stated. Notably, the government is proposing to present the budget for 2017-18 on February 1 instead of February 28.
