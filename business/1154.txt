The government has said that there was no question of closing down any bank. The RBI's decision to initiate a prompt corrective action (PCA) against some public sector banks (PSBs) led to rumours that the government may close down some banks. The RBI clarified that the PCA framework isn't intended to constrain normal operations of the banks for general public.
