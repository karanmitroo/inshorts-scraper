A US federal bank regulator has ruled to retrieve pay of former executives at Wells Fargo after a phony-accounts scandal. The lender must now seek prior approval before naming the new bank leadership. Wells Fargo had earlier agreed to pay $190 million to settle charges that bank employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge.
