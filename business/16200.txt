According to a source, Samsung Electronics has offered to buy BlackBerry for $7.5 billion, seeking its patents, as it battles Apple in the corporate market. Samsung proposed an initial price range of $13.35 to $15.49 per share, representing a premium of 38% to 60% over BlackBerry's current trading price. However, it is unclear whether Blackberry was open to the approach.
