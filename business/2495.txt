US credit reporting agency Equifax on Monday acknowledged that it suffered a major hacking attack in March. The company has said the March breach was not related to the latest hack that exposed the personal and financial data of over 140 million US consumers. The latest breach, discovered in July, exposed names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses.
