Infosys board has approved share buyback programme of up to ₹13,000 crore, making it the IT giant's first buyback offer in its 36-year history. In April, Infosys announced it would pay up to ₹13,000 crore to shareholders during the current fiscal through dividend and/or share buyback. This came after investor pressure on Infosys to utilise its $6 billion cash reserves.
