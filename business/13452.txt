Coca-Cola’s Indian subsidiary on Friday said that it “will have no option but to consider shutting down” some of its 57 factories and bottling plants in the country if the government goes ahead with the proposed 40% “sin” tax. The GST panel recommended the said tax to be imposed on goods such as carbonated drinks, tobacco products and luxury cars.
