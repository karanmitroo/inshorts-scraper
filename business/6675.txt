Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Friday tweeted that he has been blocked by Air India on Twitter. "Look what I found, quite by chance," Abdullah tweeted along with a screenshot. While he did not reveal the reason for the same, Abdullah had questioned the airline's decision to serve vegetarian meals on short-duration flights in December 2015.
