A Rolex that was owned by Vietnam's last emperor became the brand’s most expensive wristwatch ever sold at auction, fetching $5 million (over ₹32 crore). The 'Bao Dai' is one of the rarest Rolexes, one of three black-dial models known to exist with diamond hour markers. The watch was bought by the late emperor during Geneva peace negotiations in 1954.
