Planning Commission’s former deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia on Thursday said that India's GDP has the potential to grow at 8% annually “if world economy does well” and 7.7% otherwise. He further said that for India to grow at 7.7-8%, implementation of reforms like Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Bankruptcy law is necessary.
