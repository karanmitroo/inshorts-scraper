The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Monday said it will issue notices to telecom operators over the call drop issue. This comes after Reliance Jio alleged it suffered over 52 crore call failures on the networks of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea. Notably, TRAI had earlier asked operators to share congestion data to examine the claims made by Reliance.
