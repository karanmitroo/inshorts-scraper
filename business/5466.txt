The Air India pilots' association has protested against the promotion of Captain A Kathpalia as the airline's director of operations, saying he does not qualify for the post as his licence remains suspended. In February, Kathpalia's flying licence was suspended for three months by aviation regulator DGCA for skipping the compulsory breath analyser test on several occasions.
