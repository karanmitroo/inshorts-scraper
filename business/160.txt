The Weinstein Company, co-founded by Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein, announced it will file for bankruptcy after a $500-million sale deal collapsed. The company has been looking for a buyer after over 80 women accused its ex-Chairman Weinstein of sexual harassment, sparking the #MeToo movement. The studio is known for producing Oscar-nominated films including 'Silver Linings Playbook'.
