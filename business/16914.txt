After being sold at a record price of $1,850 (around Rs 1.12 lakh) per kg, Darjeelingâ€™s Makaibari tea is probably the most expensive tea in the country. However, it was a small sale of around 5 kg. "This is the highest ever price I have heard of for Indian tea," Darjeeling Tea Association secretary Kaushik Basu said.
