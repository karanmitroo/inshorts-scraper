Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal said that UK is at a very interesting phase of getting out of European Union and needs India now than ever before. India will get a "leg-up" if UK moves out of EU as it needs countries in large markets to get closer, he stated. Further, the UK should welcome Indian industry more, he added.
