A joint venture of three companies, Bam, Ferrovial, and Kier, working on London's Crossrail projects was fined a combined £1 million (₹8.4 crore) for three failures. Of these, one incident led to a construction worker's death after a tonne of wet concrete was poured onto him. Another worker was struck by an excavator and suffered fractures to his right leg.
