The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has frozen the cryptocurrency assets of AriseBank that claimed to have raised over $600 million by selling its own cryptocurrency. The regulator alleged that AriseBank failed to register with authorities and falsely claimed that it had purchased a bank. The company also allegedly failed to mention the criminal background of its founders.
