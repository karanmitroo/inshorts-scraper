US state of Kentucky passed the right-to-work legislation on Saturday to remove union membership as a condition for securing employment, making it the 27th state to pass the legislation. People can now work in union-represented shops and receive union-negotiated benefits without paying dues to the representing body. Supporters of the legislation believe it will help Kentucky attract more business.
