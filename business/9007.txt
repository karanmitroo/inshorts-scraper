India will surpass the US and become the worldâ€™s second-biggest coal producer after China by 2020, according to market analyst BMI Research. India's share in the world output will increase to 12.7% by 2020 from 9.8% currently, BMI claimed. However, it warned that India could miss its output target due to delays in opening up the sector to private miners.
