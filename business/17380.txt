The Andhra Pradesh high court Saturday vacated the stay and status-quo on the proposed merger between the Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, the biggest in the Indian pharmaceutical industry. The companies argued before the court that the insider trading allegations and the proposed merger are two different issues and the merger process should be allowed to continue.
