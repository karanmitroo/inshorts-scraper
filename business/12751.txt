The benchmark Sensex and broader Nifty lost around 1% in the week ended February 5. Analysts attributed the losses to reports of weak quarterly earnings by key corporates, coupled with falling crude oil prices and a sell-off in global markets. While the Sensex lost 253.72 points to close at 24,616.97, the Nifty fell by 74.45 points to settle at 7,489.10.
