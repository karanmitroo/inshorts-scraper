Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan praised Chairman Nandan Nilekani for correcting the "wrongdoings" committed by the previous board over CEO pay. "The salary structure for the current Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh looks reasonable with...greater focus on long-term retention," he said. He added that CEO compensation should be comparable with peer group firms while also attracting top talent.
