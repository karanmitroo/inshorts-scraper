Sportswear major Nike's CEO Mark Parker has said the company does not support US President Donald Trump's executive order banning visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. "Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the power of diversity," Parker said. These values are being threatened by the recent executive order banning refugees, as well as visitors, he added.
