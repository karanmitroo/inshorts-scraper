Ousted Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry was removed as the director of Tata Industries at its shareholdersâ€™ meet on Monday. Mistry also ceases to be the Chairman following his removal as director, Tata Industries said. Tata Sons had earlier appealed to the shareholders to remove Mistry from their boards, saying his presence may "lead to fragmentation of the Tata Group".
