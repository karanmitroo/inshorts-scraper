Fox News has ended its 10-year association with host Eric Bolling following allegations of inappropriate photos he sent to female staffers. "Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably," the company said, adding that it was cancelling the programme he hosted. Notably, last year Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes left the company following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.
