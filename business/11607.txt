The Nikkei India manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to a 4-month low of 50.5 in April, as output fell due to a slowdown in the growth of new orders. Further, the sub-index for new orders fell to a two-month low of 51.0 from 54.2. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion while below 50 signals contraction.
