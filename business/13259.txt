Capital markets regulator SEBI on Thursday gave its approval for gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) to invest a maximum of 20% of their assets in the government's Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS). The GMS is aimed at reducing Indiaâ€™s demand and import of physical gold. Gold ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges that track the price of physical gold.
