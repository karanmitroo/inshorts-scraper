The global benchmark Brent crude on Monday slumped to $31.55 per barrel, its lowest level since April 2004. Brent prices have fallen nearly 20% since the beginning of 2016. Analysts attributed the fall to China's economic slowdown and a likely supply increase from Iran after the end of sanctions on its oil exports, leading to further oversupply in global markets.
