Swiss banking major Credit Suisse's executives have cut their bonuses by 40% in an attempt to avoid a protest by shareholders and politicians at the bank's annual meeting. The bank's executives, led by CEO Tidjane Thiam, had proposed paying themselves bonuses totalling £62 million (₹500 crore) even though the bank posted heavy losses. The bank had earlier defended the bonuses.
