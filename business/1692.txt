US billionaire Michael Bloomberg on Thursday announced a $50-million plan to expand the campaign against coal-burning to reduce the threat of global warming. "Coal is the single biggest polluter...If you could just replace coal...you would make an enormous difference in the outlook for climate change," he said. Bloomberg is a UN special envoy on climate change.
