Far exceeding its target of Rs.11,200 crore, the government has received bids worth Rs.61,161 crore from the 10-day-long auction of telecommunication spectrum. Eight companies, including Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance, participated in the auction of 900MHz and 1800MHz band airwaves. Earlier, the auction in Nov-2012 and Mar-2013 had flopped as most bidders stayed away due to high floor bid prices.
