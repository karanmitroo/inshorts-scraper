No "pressure or strike" can save illegal slaughterhouses from being shut across the country, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Friday. "This is a question of...legal and illegal. Illegal slaughterhouses are not only a threat to human health but also to the environment," he added. Notably, Uttar Pradesh government had recently ordered the closure of illegal slaughterhouses.
