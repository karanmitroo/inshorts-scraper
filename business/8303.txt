Reacting to the 24-hour ban on NDTV India channel by the government, the channel on Friday issued a statement, stating, “It is shocking that NDTV has been singled out in this manner”. “Every channel and newspaper had similar coverage. In fact, NDTV’s coverage was particularly balanced,” it further added. The channel also cited the “dark days of emergency”.
