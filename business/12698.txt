The Government is reportedly considering permitting 100% FDI in the marketplace format of e-commerce retailing. Presently, global e-tailers like Amazon operate in India and homegrown firms like Flipkart have foreign investment, even as there are no clear FDI guidelines on various online retail models. Further, 100% FDI is currently allowed only in business-to-business e-commerce and not in retail.
