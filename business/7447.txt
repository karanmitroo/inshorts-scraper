India has scrapped its 10% import duty on wheat after droughts in the past two years depleted stocks, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley informed the Parliament on Thursday. The cut is effective immediately with no end date, Jaitley added. Notably, the removal of import duty comes after local wheat prices hit a record high last month.
