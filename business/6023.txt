Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai has said that online retailers will have large problems because their model is "running out of steam" and it "has not worked". "[P]eople are reluctant to give them money. They got a challenge... It's going to be a tough year," he said. Pai also recalled his earlier statement that 50%-60% of the startups will fail.
