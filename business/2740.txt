One of London's leading public relations agencies Bell Pottinger, has been expelled from the industry's trade association PRCA, after an investigation found its secret campaign to stir up racial tensions in South Africa. PRCA investigated a complaint that said Bell Pottinger sought to stir up anger about "white monopoly capital" and the "economic apartheid" in South Africa.
