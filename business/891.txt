IndiGo has been accused of "threatening" to use security force against a group of 20 passengers who allegedly refused to vacate its aircraft at Patna airport in December. A passenger alleged that three flights were cancelled and six boarding passes were issued for a single journey. However, IndiGo claimed all the passengers cooperated except this group despite being requested "politely".
