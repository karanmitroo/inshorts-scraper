Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said India was one of the fastest growing economies last year and will continue to be so this year. Jaitley further said he expects 2017 as a year in which GST will be implemented and a digitised economy will be India's future. Remonetisation has progressed extremely well and will be completed soon, he added.
