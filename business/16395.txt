The rupee fell to a 13-month low of 63.89 against the dollar on Wednesday, weighed down by capital outflows and weak equities. However, the Indian unit pared losses on likely intervention by Reserve Bank of India, to end at 63.62 to a dollar, against its previous close of 63.54. The rupee has now weakened 2.86% against the dollar since January.
