A US court has reduced damages imposed on Tata Consultancy Services by more than half in a trade secrets case with US healthcare software firm Epic Systems. The court reduced the damages to $420 million from $940 million granted by a jury verdict in April last year. Epic accused TCS of illegally acquiring information to create its own healthcare system.
