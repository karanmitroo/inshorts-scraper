Sports Direct's Mike Ashley has won a lawsuit over a £15 million (₹126 crore) deal made in a pub in 2013. In the case, a banker alleged that during a “night of heavy drinking”, Ashley agreed to pay him £15 million if company’s shares doubled. However, the judge said nobody would've thought what Ashley said in the pub was “serious”.
