On investing in Mutual Funds, the money is managed by professional fund managers and is not locked up. Mutual Funds ensure flexibility to redeem the investment either partially or entirely. Additionally, investors can also give standing instructions to the Mutual Funds company to transfer a fixed amount into their bank account on a specified date of every month or quarter.
