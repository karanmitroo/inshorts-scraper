Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has claimed that one of the reasons why former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan left was demonetisation. He stated a five-page letter speaking against demonetisation was submitted to the Centre by “someone in the Reserve Bank of India” on the day Rajan stepped down. Chidambaram has further asked the government to make that letter public.
