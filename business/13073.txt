Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has decided to donate 290,000 of her company shares to charity at “a market value of roughly $31 million”. The shares were transferred to her Philanthropy Fund, through which she can donate to different charities. Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised to donate 99% of his shares to charity over his lifetime.
