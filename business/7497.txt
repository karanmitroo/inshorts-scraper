BJP General Secretary Muralidhar Rao has said that former PM Manmohan Singh “lacks credibility” for attacking demonetisation as he himself headed the most “corrupt regime ever”. "He himself in his 10 years’ regime, had not only failed in tackling black money but... was responsible for accumulation of black money,” Rao said. Singh earlier said that demonetisation was an “organised loot”.
