US investment bank Morgan Stanley was on Wednesday penalised $1 million for lax protection of confidential consumer data, after an employee took records on 7,30,000 clients. The employee transferred the consumer data to his personal computer, before “a likely third party” hacked into his server to access the data, and posted some of it online for sale, the SEC said.
