The move to demonetise high-value currency will lead to a surge in economic activity, which will in turn push GDP growth to 10%, Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has said. “Some economists predicted that demonetisation would dampen economic activity over the next two quarters. But I believe that the decision to scrap high-value banknotes would push GDP growth,” Meghwal stated.
