Air Transport World (ATW) magazine has named Etihad Airways the ‘Airline of the Year 2016’. The award was given on parameters including operations, financial performance, safety and unique cabin features like Etihad's Residence on-board apartment which has a three-room suite with a personal butler. Southwest Airlines had won the title last year and Delta Air Lines the year before that.
