The Securities and Exchange Board of India on Friday approved amendments to facilitate the growth of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts. With this, the REITs can now invest up to 20% in under-construction real estate projects, up from the earlier 10% cap. Further, the REITs will become more flexible in choosing lucrative projects, analysts said.
