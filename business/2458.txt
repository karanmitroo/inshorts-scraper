Telecom regulator TRAI's Chairman RS Sharma on Tuesday dismissed charges of non-transparency in its decision to cut Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC). He said the cost calculation is objective and scientific, and there is no question of "helping or harming" any operator. Rejecting allegations that the rate cut favoured one operator, Sharma said IUC was driven by consumer and industry interest.
