Israel's Tax Authority has reportedly asked Coca-Cola to pay $45 million (₹286 crore) in taxes on royalties that it receives from its local franchise for use of the brand name in Israel. Reports suggested the tax bill is based on royalties of about $279 million (over ₹1,770 crore) transferred in recent years to Coca-Cola from Central Bottling, its Israel franchiser.
