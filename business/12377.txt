Financial ratings agency Fitch on Monday lowered Indiaâ€™s economic growth forecast for the 2016-17 fiscal to 7.7% from 8% predicted in December, while maintaining the GDP projection for the current fiscal at 7.5%. Fitch said gradual recovery in the next two fiscals would be supported by higher real disposable income, assuming a normal monsoon after two years of below-average rainfall.
