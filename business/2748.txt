Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj said that in the middleweight motorcycle segment, Royal Enfield has a huge head start over the company. Bajaj is facing competition in India from a brand that has a longer history, he noted. "If they have a 50-year history I would say, we have caught up with 45 years in one year's time," Bajaj added.
