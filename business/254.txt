Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has said that the fate of PNB's $1.77-billion fraud case against his client is "khoda pahad nikli chuhiya". Aggarwal further asked the media on what basis they have branded Nirav as a "fugitive". Earlier, Aggarwal had said the probing agencies won't be able to prove the charges against Nirav in the court.
