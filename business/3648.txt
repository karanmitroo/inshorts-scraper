Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran has said he doesn't brief Tata Trusts of his every move with each company. He then added "but they are the primary shareholder..I don't think there is a conflict in keeping them informed". He also said the group is in "urgent need" of renovation, with some of its biggest businesses growing vulnerable to smaller rivals.
