The GST Council on Wednesday failed to decide the tax rates under the uniform indirect tax regime and it will now be discussed in the next meeting in November. FM Arun Jaitley said, “We have converged towards consensus on compensation to losing states and discussed different tax structure.” The said compensation includes levying a cess on luxury and sin goods.
