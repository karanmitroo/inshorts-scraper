The government might make hallmarking along with carat count mandatory for gold jewellery sold in the country, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Friday. "At present people don't get to know quality of gold jewellery that they buy," he said. "It will be done for jewellery in three categories- 14 carat, 18 carat and 22 carat," he added.
