Amazon on Thursday launched a marketplace for handcrafted goods called ‘Handmade at Amazon’. The service would allow customers to choose from 80,000 products made by artisans and offered by 5,000 sellers from 60 countries. The arts-and-crafts marketplace would compete with handmade and vintage items website ‘Etsy’ while enabling Amazon to enhance its position as a portal for third-party sellers.
