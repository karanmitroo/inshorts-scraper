Urban local bodies in Maharashtra have collected over ₹200 crore from citizens towards payment of bills in ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, which have been demonetised. The sum was collected towards bills related to electricity, water, property, and other government dues. This came after the government announced a 3-day extension on payment of utility bills with old notes till November 14.
