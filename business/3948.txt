In a new lawsuit, chipmaker Qualcomm has asked US regulators to ban entry of new iPhones into the country and halt sales of iPhones that have already been imported. Qualcomm accused Apple of using its patents to develop the iPhone but refusing to pay for it. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion accusing it of overcharging for royalties.
