Oil billionaire William Kallop is having his 217-foot yacht 'Natita' seized by Goldman Sachs for failing to pay a $32 million (â‚¹205 crore) loan. Kallop used the yacht, featuring a movie theatre and helipad, as collateral for the loan in 2014. Goldman claimed Kallop stopped repaying the loan following which it filed a suit and was awarded the boat.
