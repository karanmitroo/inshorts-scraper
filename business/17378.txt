With more than 9 lakh applications in the year ended March 31, job applications that IT major Infosys received has hit a 7-year high. The company has attributed this to its improved image among potential employees after the return of Narayana Murthy. The number of job applicants at Infosys has declined from 8,29,800 (in 2011) to 3,79,000 in fiscal 2013.
