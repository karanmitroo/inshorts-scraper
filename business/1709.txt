BJP MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that Aadhaar was rushed and forced on the country by authorities that failed to first create a proper ecosystem. He said information of crores of people was made available online "with kind of a canned narrative...without addressing...issues relating to privacy". "Data privacy, and privacy in the digital world, is not an elitist issue," he added.
