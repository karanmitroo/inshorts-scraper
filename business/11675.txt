The Madras High Court on Friday ordered status quo till June 3 on a central notification proposing to levy excise duty on gold jewellery. The court was answering a petition filed by a jewellery body seeking to quash the notification. Jewellery organisations across India had earlier gone on a strike against the proposed duty for nearly six weeks during March-April.
