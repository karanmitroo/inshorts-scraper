The Delhi government on Saturday said value-added tax (VAT) collection in the ongoing fiscal has crossed ₹20,000 crore. The government had set ₹24,000 crore as the target but later reduced it to ₹21,000 crore on the grounds of unsteady collection. Around ₹18,500 crore was collected as VAT in 2014-15. Notably, VAT accounts for over two-thirds of the Delhi government’s revenue.
