A US judge revoked former Turing Pharmaceuticals' CEO Martin Shkreli's bail over a Facebook post in which he offered $5,000 (â‚¹3.2 lakh) to anyone who would bring him a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair. The judge declared Shkreli a "danger to the community" and ordered for him to be jailed immediately. Earlier, Shkreli's lawyer claimed the post was "political satire".
