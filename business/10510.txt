The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to beleaguered industrialist Vijay Mallya over contempt petition filed by banks for not disclosing his assets. It has also given more time to Debt Recovery Tribunal for Mallya's loan default case hearing. Mallya was earlier directed to disclose assets, after creditors rejected his â‚¹4,000 crore offer for grounded Kingfisher Airlines' debt settlement.
