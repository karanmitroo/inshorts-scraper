The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal on Friday reported a loss of $8 billion in 2015 after a writedown of its mining operation. The company's share prices reportedly fell 60% over the last 12 months amid falling commodity prices and a surge in cheap Chinese exports. However, the company plans to raise $3 billion by issuing shares to reduce debt.
