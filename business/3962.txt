A United Airlines passenger was forced to give up her 27-month-old son's seat and hold him for over three hours during the flight. Shirley Yamauchi had to pay $1,000 for her son's seat because children over the age of two are required to have their own seat. The airline gave the seat to another passenger who was on standby.
