Following their recent under-performance in the domestic market, carmaker Maruti Suzuki Thursday declared the end of the road for two other Maruti small cars - A Star and Estilo. The Celerio, which was launched by the company earlier this month, is expected to fill the void left by the two cars. Last month, it had declared termination of Maruti 800.
