India will allow non-state mining companies to mine and sell coal for the first time in more than four decades, coal secretary Susheel Kumar has said. The Coal Ministry will auction four mines to both state-run and private companies in April. The winning bidders will be allowed to sell the coal, which can currently be done by few state-run companies.
