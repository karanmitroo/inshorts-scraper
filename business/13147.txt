Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the devaluation of Chinese Yuan is "worrying" as it is "definitely going to make imported goods [from China] cheaper". She further said the move would widen India's trade deficit with the neighbour as indigenous products will become relatively expensive. India's trade deficit with China stood at around $49 billion during 2014-15 fiscal year.
