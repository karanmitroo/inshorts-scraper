CEO of security firm Securitas, Alf Göransson has been declared bankrupt after his personal identification was stolen earlier this year. The hacker used Göransson's identity to seek loan of an undisclosed amount, and then filed a bankruptcy application in his name. Göransson wasn’t informed until a court declared him bankrupt, after which he was de-registered as Securitas President and CEO.
