High-end department store John Lewis has removed 'boys' and 'girls' labels from its children's clothing range. Instead, new genderless labels say either 'Boys & Girls' or 'Girls & Boys', and are on all own-brand clothing for 0-14 years. The chain is also doing away with individual sections dedicated to boys and girls to avoid 'reinforcing gender stereotypes'.
