More than 50 leading US tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, have pledged over $650 million to aid 6.3 million refugees including children in 20 countries. They will help more than 80,000 children in refugee camps to get an education under government initiatives and will also help with internships, training, and job placement of refugees, US President Barack Obama said.
