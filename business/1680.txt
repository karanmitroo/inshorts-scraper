Online local search engine Just Dial's shares surged nearly 20% during intraday trade on Friday. This comes after a media report said Google is in talks with the company to acquire its business. However, Just Dial denied the report saying, "there is no proposal in respect of acquisition of business of Just Dial by Google and news published...is factually incorrect."
