Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Durex condoms and Dettol products, has denied allegations of tax avoidance levelled by charity group Oxfam. Oxfam said Reckitt avoided taxes of $85.33 million in France and $92.5 million in Australia, among others, between 2013-2015. However, Reckitt said its tax policy is "totally legal and the norm for the majority of global businesses".
