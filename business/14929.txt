Pharmaceuticals company Sun Pharma, which is facing decline in revenue and profit, is reportedly planning to exit Ranbaxy's "low-margin" overseas business. Furthermore, it is also mulling to discontinue the anti-retrovirals (ARV) business and API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) operations as part of its efforts to "discontinue certain non-strategic businesses" to boost growth.
