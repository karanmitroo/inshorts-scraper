The White House has vowed to fight media "tooth and nail every day" as it believes they are attempting to "delegitimise" US President Donald Trump. This comes after Trump's team claimed that they put forward "alternative facts" as they believed that the media was reporting inaccurately. Interestingly, Trump has claimed that he is in a "running war" with the media.
