The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent samples of Johnson & Johnson baby powder for lab testing. This comes after J&J was fined $72 million in February after a US woman's death from ovarian cancer was linked to the use of the company's talc-based powders. "This is a precautionary measure after the US incident," FDA Commissioner said.
