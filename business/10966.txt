To increase domestic supply and check the rising prices of sugar, the government on Thursday imposed a 20% customs duty on the export of raw, white, or refined sugar. This comes amid rising prices of various commodities including tomato, wheat, and pulses. Notably, India is the world's second-largest sugar producer and has exported 1.6 million tonnes sugar since October 2015.
