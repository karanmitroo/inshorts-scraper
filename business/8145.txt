After Congress leader Rahul Gandhi charged that demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes has hit farmers, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that Gandhi must “apply his mind”. He must understand that those in farming will not face any tax, Jaitley said. Further, Jaitley called former Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s estimated cost of printing new notes as “highly exaggerated”.
