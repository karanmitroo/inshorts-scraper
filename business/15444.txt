The Indian Rupee fell to its lowest in 20-month to Rs 63.92 v/s USD on Thursday. This is mainly attributed to the government's taxation policies that threaten to reduce the appeal of local assets for foreign institutions. Traders across the country are waiting for the central banks steps to prevent a further sharp fall in the currency.
