Maruti Suzuki India Chairman RC Bhargava on Thursday said Ratan Tata needs to be given credit for attempting to offer an affordable car through Nano. "The intention was a good intention and Tatas tried to fulfill that intention," he said. His comments come after ousted Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry said Nano needed to be shut down due to 'peak' losses.
