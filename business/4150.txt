Potential jurors at Martin Shkreli's fraud trial were excused as they couldn’t be impartial towards former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO, who raised an HIV drug's price by 5,400%. One juror called him “face of corporate greed”, while another labelled him “the most hated man in America”. Another juror stated, when she saw Shkreli, "I said in my head, ‘That’s a snake’."
