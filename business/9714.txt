The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which maps the service sector activity, rose to its highest level in over three-and-half years to 54.7 in August, against 51.9 in July. The rise was attributed to growth in incoming new business levels. Further, the Nikkei India Composite PMI Output Index climbed to a 42-month high of 54.6 during this period.
