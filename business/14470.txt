South Korea's Environmental Ministry said on Tuesday that it would investigate 4000-5000 cars of two Volkswagen models and one Audi model for emissions. This came after Volkswagen AG admitted to rigging emission tests of diesel-fuelled cars in the US. The Ministry also said that if Volkswagen cars failed the tests, the probe could be expanded to all German diesel cars.
