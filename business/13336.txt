RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday called for “a careful calibration of domestic policies to withstand global headwinds” from China's economic slowdown and the US Federal Reserve’s rate hike. Even though India is “relatively better placed” and “despite domestic inflation coming down”, such international developments can impact “the volatility of inflation and perhaps its level”, Rajan added.
