SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has claimed that their investments in the global e-commerce market have been successful in keeping Amazon at bay. He said that Flipkart is India's number one "e-tailer" with a share of 60% in the domestic e-commerce market, and is bigger than Amazon India. Earlier this year, SoftBank's Vision Fund had invested around $2.5 billion in Flipkart.
