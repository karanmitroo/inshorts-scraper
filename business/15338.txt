State-owned United Bank of India (UBI) has admitted that it no longer hopes to recover its dues of Rs 400 crore from the Kingfisher Airlines. "In last two years, we lost interest payment and we may be able to recover that much and the principal amount we may not," UBI Managing Director and CEO P Srinivas said.
