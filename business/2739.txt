Hotel Leelaventure has said there is no final agreement with any party to sell its Chennai hotel, though negotiations are on to sell it. This came in response to a report that Marigold Capital and Investments had agreed to buy the property. The company continues to evaluate proposals and would inform the bourses at an appropriate time, Hotel Leelaventure said.
