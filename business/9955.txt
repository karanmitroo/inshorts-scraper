The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday retained the 'Domestic Systemically Important Banks' (D-SIBs) status or the 'too big to fail' tag for the SBI and ICICI. RBI considers factors like size and international links for the classification and imposes additional capital requirements on D-SIBs. Notably, RBI started classifying banks that require higher levels of supervision as D-SIBs last year.
