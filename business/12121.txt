In order to refocus on digital content, Qatar's state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera Network Media has fired around 500 employees mostly from its Qatar headquarters. "We are confident this is an important decision to improve our competitiveness," said Al Jazeera's acting director-general Mostefa Souag. Earlier in January, the organisation had announced the shutting down of its operations in the US.
