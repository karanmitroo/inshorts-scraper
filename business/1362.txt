The Rajasthan High Court has asked the state government to submit its response on whether garlic is categorised as a spice or a vegetable. While hearing a PIL, the court also asked the government whether selling garlic in grain markets should attract GST. The sale of garlic was allowed in grain markets following a bumper produce last year.
