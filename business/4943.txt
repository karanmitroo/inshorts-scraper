Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos on Tuesday said that the country has reached a preliminary agreement with its creditors, paving the way for debt relief talks. Tsakalotos added that the agreement is vital to revive the country's struggling economy. Notably, Greece needs a fresh infusion of funds for debt repayments of €7 billion (over ₹49,000 crore) in July.
