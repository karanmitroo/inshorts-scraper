Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors forecast an annual net loss of $1.4 billion on Wednesday. This is reportedly the first time in eight years that the firm has seen a loss. Earlier in April, Mitsubishi admitted to overstating mileage on four of its vehicles. Fellow automaker Nissan later purchased a one-third stake in Mitsubishi.
