Indian automotive manufacturer Tata Motors on Friday posted a 57.25% year-on-year decline in consolidated profit after tax at ₹2,236 crores for the quarter ended June. However, the company's consolidated revenue increased by 9% to ₹67,056 crore during the period. The operating performance in the quarter reflected the overall higher wholesales, offset by adverse forex impact, the firm said.
