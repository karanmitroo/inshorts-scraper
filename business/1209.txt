Dr Reddy's Laboratories has agreed to pay $5 million to resolve US claims that it sold drugs in packaging that wasn't tested for child safety. The company said it disagreed with the allegations but agreed to the settlement to avoid prolonged litigation. "Dr Reddy's is not aware of any reports that any child gained access to these products," it added.
