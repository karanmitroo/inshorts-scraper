The Parliament on Thursday passed the much-awaited Companies Bill, replacing the decades old Companies Act-1956, in order to bring transparency and protect the interest of employees and small investors. The bill makes it mandatory for companies to spend 2% of their average profits on corporate social responsibility(CSR) and payment of 2-years' salary to employees in case a company shuts operations.
