Tata Sons ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry on Tuesday said any allegation that he had mis-handled a dispute with Japanese telecom major NTT DoCoMo were baseless. All decisions were taken with the unanimous approval of the Tata Sons Board and Ratan Tata, his statement read. Tata's suggestion that he acted without knowledge of Ratan Tata is "false and mischievous", Mistry added.
