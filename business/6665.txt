The ICICI Bank has refused National Payments Corporation of India's (NPCI) call to unblock Flipkart's digital wallet PhonePe from its platform. ICICI Bank said PhonePe allows users of only its own UPI handle to make payments via the app, and called it a â€œrestrictive practice". As per UPI guidelines, customers of any bank can use any UPI-based app for payments.
