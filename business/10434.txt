Gold prices on Saturday surged to a 29-month high of ₹31,340 and ₹31,190 per ten grams for gold of 99.9% and 99.5% purity respectively. Bullion traders said sentiment bolstered after gold gained overseas as the dollar weakened and the US economy grew less-than-expected in the June quarter, boosting demand for safe-haven assets. Globally, gold rose 1.2% to $1,357.50/ounce yesterday.
