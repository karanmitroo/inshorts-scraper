Amid the cash crunch following demonetisation, the demand for card-swipe machines at banks like HDFC has risen from 5,000 requests in a month to 5,000 in a day, an official said. Further, Axis Bank recorded a three-time jump in demand for the point-of-sale machines. The machines facilitate payment from customers by swiping their debit/credit/pre-paid cards on POS terminals.
