Tax rates on over two dozen products ranging from dosa batter to kitchen lighter may be lowered by GST Council after anomalies in their fixation were pointed out, officials said. GST on dosa batter has reportedly been proposed to be lowered to 12% against 18% currently, and brooms and brushes would be tax free as against the current 5% GST.
