Raymond Group's Chairman Emeritus Vijaypat Singhania, who was once among India's richest men, is struggling financially because of son Gautam Singhania, his advocate Dinyar Madon said. The retired tycoon gave up shares worth â‚¹1,000 crore in his son's favour, who's now trying to "squeeze him" out. All his perks, like car and a driver, have been taken away, Madon added.
