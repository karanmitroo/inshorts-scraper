A bomb squad was called to inspect a suspicious package found in a bathroom cubicle at a McDonald's branch just two miles from where singer Robbie Williams was set to perform in Edinburgh. Staff and customers were rushed out of the restaurant by the police. The item was later found to pose no risk to public and customers.
