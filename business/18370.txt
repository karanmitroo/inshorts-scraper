India's gold import crashed by 95% in August to 2.5-tonne from 47.5-tonne in July, after RBI issued a new rule to rescue rupee demanding importers to re-export at least 20% of their overseas' purchases and thus discourage non-essential imports, including gold. Government wants to reduce current account deficit (CAD) to $70-billion in 2013-14, and is eager to curb non-essential imports.
