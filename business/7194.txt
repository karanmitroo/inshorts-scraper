Meru Cabs CEO Siddhartha Pahwa has claimed that its rivals Ola and Uber are each losing ₹340 crore every month. "The only difference between us and them is that they are dumping capital on drivers and customers, and we aren’t," he said. "The day the incentives stop, drivers will move away from Uber and Ola," added Pahwa.
