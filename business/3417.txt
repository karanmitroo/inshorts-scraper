Iran has said that it is not obliged to award the Farzad B gas field to India. Iranian officials said although both the countries jointly conducted studies on the field, no decision was made to award its development rights to India. This reportedly comes after India decided to reduce oil imports from Iran amid a deadlock over the field.
