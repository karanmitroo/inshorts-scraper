India's retail price inflation dropped to a new record low at 2.99% in April from a nearly five-month high of 3.89% in March, according to government data. The drop was attributed to lower cost of food items, including pulses and vegetables that showed a deflationary trend. Overall food inflation for April was at 0.61% as against 1.93% previously.
