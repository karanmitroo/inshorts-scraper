Growth in India's eight core sectors (coal, cement, crude oil, natural gas, steel, refinery products, fertilisers, and electricity) slowed to 3.2% year-on-year in July from 5.2% in June, data released on Wednesday stated. Refinery products grew the highest (13.7%), followed by coal (5.1%). The slowdown was on account of monsoon that hit output in sectors such as cement, analysts said.
