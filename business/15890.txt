Employees union of state-run airports Monday called an all-India strike on March-11 to protest against the governmentâ€™s move to hand over airports to private operators. The government has already invested Rs 5,000 crore public money in airports. The decision to strike work was taken at a meeting of the joint forum of Airports Authority of India associations and unions Friday.
