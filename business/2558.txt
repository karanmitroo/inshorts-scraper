Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) jumped over 10% during intraday trade on Thursday, after Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said it would make rolling stock for India's first bullet train project. This is BHEL's biggest gain in one year. The bullet train is expected to reduce the travel time between Ahmedabad and Mumbai from seven hours to around two hours.
