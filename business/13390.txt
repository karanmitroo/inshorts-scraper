India has ranked 97 out of 144 countries in Forbes’ annual ‘Best Countries for Business’ list for 2015. Forbes cited “an inefficient power generation and distribution system, ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights, decades-long civil litigation dockets, inadequate transport and agricultural infrastructure” among the reasons for India’s low rank. The list was topped by Denmark.
