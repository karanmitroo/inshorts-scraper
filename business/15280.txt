Motorbike manufacturer Royal Enfield is planning to foray into Latin America and Southeast Asian markets to boost growth, CEO Siddhartha Lal said on Thursday. The company already exports motorcycles to these markets, but could consider boosting local sales or setting-up production plants. The company also launched 3 variants of world-war inspired 500cc despatch bikes in an event on Thursday.
