Starting November 30, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) operated currency presses have started printing the new ₹500 notes as two government-owned presses are running behind schedule. The RBI presses hope to print around 1 billion of the new ₹500 notes by December end. Until now, the RBI operated presses were printing only ₹2,000 and a few lower denomination notes.
