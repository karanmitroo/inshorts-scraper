Two ex-employees of British investment management firm Marathon, who were sued for £15 million (₹124.5 crore) by the company, have been ordered to pay only £1 (₹83) each. Marathon accused the employees of downloading 40,000 files before joining a rival firm to gain "competitive advantage". However, the judge found that the employees didn't derive any material benefit from the documents.
