Beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya on Friday said faulty engines were one of the factors for the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines. A group firm of Pratt & Whitney has been sued for supplying defective engines to Kingfisher Airlines, Mallya stated. Notably, he has been declared a wilful defaulter and is wanted for default in loan payments related to the now-defunct airlines.
