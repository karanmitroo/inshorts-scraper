Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) on Monday told the Delhi High Court that AAP government was “never entitled” to lodge an FIR against it over the alleged irregularities in raising the price of gas. RIL sought to quash the FIR lodged by Anti-Corruption Branch of Delhi government in 2014, saying it did not have the jurisdiction to probe such matter.
