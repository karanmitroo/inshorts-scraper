Fox News host Bill O’Reilly is taking a "long-scheduled vacation" after reports of financial settlements over alleged sexual harassment. O’Reilly’s holiday follows a wave of companies pulling advertisements from his prime-time show, the cable news channel’s biggest. A woman claimed O'Reilly revoked an offer of a job on the network after she declined to join him in his hotel suite.
