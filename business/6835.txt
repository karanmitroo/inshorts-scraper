India's retail inflation eased to a three-year low of 3.41% in the month of December, as against 3.63% in November 2016, government data released on Thursday stated. This was due to weak demand as consumers grappled with cash crunch following demonetisation, reports said. Further, food inflation also fell to 1.37% in December, from 2.11% in November.
