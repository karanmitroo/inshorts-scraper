Hong Kong Disneyland, which reported a loss last year, is set to undergo a $1.4 billion (around â‚¹9,600 crore) expansion that will include the addition of Frozen and Marvel-themed lands. The expansion costs will be divided according to ownership, with the Hong Kong government spending $748 million as it owns 53% of the park. Disney will fund the remaining amount.
