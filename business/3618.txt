Private equity firms KKR and Warburg Pincus are the latest to express interest in acquiring Air India's business, reports said. The two buyout firms have separately sought details of the proposed privatisation process. A potential debt write-off and access to the airline's international routes have already drawn interest from InterGlobe Aviation, which runs the IndiGo airline, and the Tata group.
