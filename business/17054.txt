The second-round sale of the Xiaomi Mi 3 on Flipkart ended two minutes after it started, with the sale of all the units. The first round of sales last week had ended in an hour, causing the Flipkart server to crash due to excess demand. Pre-registration for the third-round of sales, on Aug-5, was opened on Tuesday evening, 6 pm.
