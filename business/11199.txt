Following the hike in petrol prices, Goa government on Wednesday said it will reduce the Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol to keep the price in check. The government had promised in the budget that it will not allow petrol prices to exceed ₹60/litre, Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said. Notably, after the recent hike, petrol now costs ₹62/litre in Goa.
