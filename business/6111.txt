Amid criticism over demonetisation, RBI Governor Urjit Patel on Friday said "it is important that one grows a thick skin fast" and that RBI has done that. "We have gone about our work...and valid criticism is something that we are open to," Patel stated. The banking system has done a "Herculean job" over the last few months, he further added.
