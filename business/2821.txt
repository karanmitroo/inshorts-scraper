Regional low-cost airline Air Costa has still not refunded its fliers after temporarily suspending operations in a surprise move in February. The airline's website and customer care helpline have also stopped working, following which customers posted complaints on online consumer forums. A passenger complained that "we have sent several reminders and every time they revert seeking 15-days' time".
