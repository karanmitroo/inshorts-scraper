US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday said that the interest rate hike from the present 'near-zero' rates is a ”live possibility”. However, she also said that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not made any final decision on the same, adding that the decision "will depend very much on the actual performance of the economy".
