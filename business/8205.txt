Singapore Airlines is evaluating offers by US-based Boeing and France-based Airbus to build the world's longest jet, which will be added to its fleet, reports have said. The airline is expected to back one of the company's designs by the end of the year. Both planes will be the longest twin-aisle jets ever, and the biggest with only two engines.
