Reliance Jio has said telecom regulator TRAI's decision to slash Interconnection Usage Charge (IUC) by over 50% to six paise per minute, benefits users and not the company. Reliance Jio said its older rivals "have a history of opposing all the IUC regulations over the last eight years, but have not been successful in thwarting passing of the benefits...to customers."
