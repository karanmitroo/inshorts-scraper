The RBI has said counting machines are "not being used" in any of its offices for tallying the number of demonetised ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, according to an RTI reply. It also denied sharing information on total number of personnel deployed for counting these notes. Notably, around 99% of the ₹15.44 lakh crore scrapped notes have returned to the system.
