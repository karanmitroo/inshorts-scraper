Reliance Industries has termed reports of listing its telecom subsidiary Jio as speculative, ruling out such a possibility in the near future. A report had said the Mukesh Ambani-led firm is holding internal discussions for the IPO as soon as late 2018 or early 2019. "We do not comment on media speculation and rumours," a Reliance spokesperson said.
