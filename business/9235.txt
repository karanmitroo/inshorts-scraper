A survey by insurance company Apollo Munich has revealed that 51% of the health insurance policy-holders in India are under-insured. This means people purchased insurance schemes of lower value and it would not fully cover the cost of medical emergencies. The survey included 7 lakh policyholders across 82 cities and found that 52% men and 46% women were under-insured.
