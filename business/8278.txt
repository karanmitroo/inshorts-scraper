American investor Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway on Friday reported a record $84.8 billion cash balance on its books in the quarter ended September. This is against the previous record of $72.7 billion as of June. The increase in cash was partly attributed to the sale of preferred stock in chewing-gum maker Wrigley.
