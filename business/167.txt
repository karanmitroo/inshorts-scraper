The CBI raided the Mumbai offices of the law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas last week in connection with the $1.77-billion PNB fraud case, according to reports. The firm was reportedly hired by Nirav Modi around a month before the scam became public. However, it had terminated Nirav's assignment as soon as the scam was uncovered.
