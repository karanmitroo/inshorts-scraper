A man was arrested at London Luton Airport after he allegedly tried to open a plane door during a Wizz Air flight. The man walked from front of the plane, sat next to a woman by the emergency exit over the wing, and suddenly lunged across her to open the door. He was then restrained by crew on the flight.
