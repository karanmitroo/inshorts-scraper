Tata Teleservices' shareholders on Wednesday 'unanimously' removed Cyrus Mistry from its Director's post, reports said. This comes a day after TCS shareholders removed the ousted Tata Sons Chairman from its Director's post. "[I] will continue to work at various forums to be the voice for change in Tata Group, its governance and protection of stakeholders' rights," Mistry said.
