The government has informed the Supreme Court that it will withdraw its petition to take over the management of real estate company Unitech. The SC had earlier stayed a National Company Law Tribunal order allowing the Centre to take over Unitech's management. The tribunal had suspended all eight directors of Unitech over allegations of mismanagement and siphoning of funds.
