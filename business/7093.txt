Delhi lawyer Rohit Tandon has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate over illegal conversion of old notes worth more than ₹60 crore. In a raid conducted at Tandon's office earlier this month, ₹13.5 crore cash was seized, among which ₹2.6 crore was in new banknotes. A Kotak Mahindra Bank's branch manager has also been arrested for exchanging notes for Tandon.
