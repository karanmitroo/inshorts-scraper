The US Geological Survey (USGS) has claimed to have found the biggest ever oil reserve of the country in west Texas. The oil fields in the Permian Basin are estimated to contain around 20 billion barrels of oil worth around $900 billion. "Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable," USGS said.
