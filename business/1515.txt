Two Boeing 747 jumbo jets were auctioned on Alibaba-owned Chinese e-shopping website Taobao for 322.8 million yuan (â‚¹316 crore) on Tuesday. The planes had been kept in storage since 2013 as the company that owned them had filed for bankruptcy, and six previous offline auctions to sell them had failed. The jets were purchased by Chinese carrier SF Airlines.
