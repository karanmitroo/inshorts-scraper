The Cabinet on Tuesday approved hiving off mobile tower assets of state-run telecom firm Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) into a separate company, fully owned by BSNL. There are around 4,42,000 mobile towers in the country, out of which BSNL owns more than 66,000. "This approval authorises BSNL to monetise its telecom tower infrastructure," the government said.
