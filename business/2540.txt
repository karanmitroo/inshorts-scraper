Dutch bank Bunq has penalised an 18-year-old school student with a week of community service after he carried out cyber attacks on Bunq. The boy, who visited the bank to confess and apologise, was reportedly angry over a price hike by the bank. According to a Bunq employee, pressing charges was "too much of a punishment" for a "youthful sin".
