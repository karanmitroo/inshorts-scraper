A consortium of 17 banks on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court to ensure that the ex-chairman of UB Group, Vijay Mallya, does not leave the country. This comes a day after a tribunal blocked Mallya's access to a $75 million settlement and the Enforcement Directorate slapped a money laundering case against him. The court will hear the matter on Wednesday.
