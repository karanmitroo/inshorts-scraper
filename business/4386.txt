India's third-largest software company Wipro said the payable date for its American Depository Receipts bonus issue is yet to be determined. The clarification came after its US-listed shares slumped 49%, following which their trading was halted for a while. Notably, Wipro's US-listed shares have been down for past four sessions, following reports of the company's sale, which Wipro later denied.
