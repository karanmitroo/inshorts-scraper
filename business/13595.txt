Several companies on Wednesday sued Citigroup for allegedly failing to monitor toxic mortgage-backed securities dating from 2004-2007 exceeding $13.8 billion, resulting in a $2.3 billion loss. Citibank ignored the "pervasive and systemic deficiencies" in the underlying loans, fearing it might "jeopardize its business relationships" with loan servicing companies including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo.
