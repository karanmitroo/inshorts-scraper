RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Thursday warned companies against the risks of over-borrowing, saying, “Debt is very much like a dynamite. It is an instrument which is very useful in right places and explosive in others... Moderation is required and some debt is good.” Further, Rajan called the 3-3.2% foreign contribution in government debt in the Indian economy “very reasonable”.
