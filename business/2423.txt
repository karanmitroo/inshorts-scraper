According to the lawsuit filed against US-based startup Social Finance (SoFi) earlier this week, the culture at the startup is that of 'rampant sexual activity'. The lawsuit, filed by a former loan reviewer, also claimed that she was repeatedly sexually harassed while working there. Last week, SoFi replaced its CEO Mike Cagney amid allegations that he sexually harassed female employees.
