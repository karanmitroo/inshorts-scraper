Journalist Arnab Goswami on Tuesday said that domestic journalists are better than the best to cover the world. "We do not have the presence in the global media and I think that is sad," he added. "I'd love to bring together some journalists and start covering the world," said Goswami, who quit Times Now to start his new venture ‘Republic’.
