Market regulator SEBI on Friday barred eight listed firms along with 40 of their promoters and directors from dealing in the securities market for five years for failing to comply with listing agreement norms. SEBI said that these companies and their promoters were non-traceable despite being served several show-cause notices and they failed to explain the reasons for norms' violation.
