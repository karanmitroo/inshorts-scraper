India's wholesale prices fell at an annual rate of 2.4% in June, government data showed on Tuesday. This is the eighth straight month of decline in wholesale prices, primarily on the back of weak fuel prices globally. The decline is faster than the 2.2% fall forecast by economists and the 2.36% annual fall in May.
