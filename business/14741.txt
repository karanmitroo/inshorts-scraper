Nestle Chairman Peter Brabeck has said Indian Authorities forced the company to burn 29,000 tonnes of Maggi. Dismissing India's claims of Maggi being unhealthy, Brabeck said, "Laboratories in the US, Britain, Australia and Singapore didn't find anything harmful in the noodles. Our products are safe for consumers". He said the Indian case was "not harmless and cannot to be underestimated."
