The Centre, under its Digital India programme, has announced Karang in Manipur as the country's first cashless island. The Karang island is located in the middle of Loktak lake, the largest freshwater lake in the North Eastern part of India. This comes after campaigns on cashless transactions were held by the island's boat association and other bodies from January 9-12.
