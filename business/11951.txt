The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty on Friday closed on a flat note, with the Sensex falling 11.58 points to 24,673.84, and the Nifty rising 8.75 points to 7,555.20. Market sentiment remained weak in the absence of any positive trigger amid sustained capital outflows by foreign funds, analysts said. NTPC and TCS ended as the biggest gainer and loser respectively.
