Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. Bitcoins are generated by a process called 'mining' where individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. Bitcoins can be exchanged with other currencies. Cyberattackers usually prefer payments in bitcoins as the account owners cannot be necessarily traced.
