The Ministry of External Affairs on Sunday revoked liquor baron Vijay Mallya's passport in an attempt to bring him back to India. The Enforcement Directorate had asked that Mallya's passport be revoked after he failed to appear despite being summoned thrice. This comes after a non-bailable warrant was issued for Mallya and the government started the process for his deportation.
