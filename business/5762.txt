LinkedIn Co-founder Reid Hoffman announced on Wednesday that he has joined the board of directors at Microsoft. This follows Microsoft's $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year. As a Microsoft board member, Hoffman said his focus will remain on LinkedIn itself, while also working to help Microsoft build more connections in Silicon Valley.
