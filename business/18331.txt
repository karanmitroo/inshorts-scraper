India's exports climbed 13% to $26-billion in August and imports fell marginally as gold-imports declined from July's $2.2-billion to $650-million in August, helping trim the trade-deficit. According to the Commerce ministry lower-demand in the US and Europe decreased export-demand whereas the high oil and gold inflows boosted imports, but with the economic-situation improving in the West, exports have started rising.
