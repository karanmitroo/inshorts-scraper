The European Commission Chief Jean-Claude Juncker has said nobody outside India calls its 5.7% GDP growth as a slowdown. He added, "5.7% (GDP) by comparison to 2% in Europe is showing that India is doing well." The comment comes after the country saw its economic growth rate slowing down to a three-year low in the June quarter.
