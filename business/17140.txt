At a time when Sahara group chief Subrata Roy is struggling to raise Rs.10,000 crore to secure bail, the income tax department Thursday raised an interim demand of Rs 4,860 crore on the group. Meanwhile, the company pleaded the court to allow it to sell off three hotels in New York and London to raise the bail amount.
