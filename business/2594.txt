ITC CEO Sanjiv Puri has said tobacco regulations should not be discriminatory to the cigarette industry. He said taxes on cigarettes have "increased by more than 200% in last few years", resulting in smuggling of cigarettes and other forms of tobacco in India. Over a long period, tobacco consumption has not gone down but only increased, he added.
