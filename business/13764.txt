The Confederation of British Industry, in its latest quarterly economic forecast, has predicted India to be the fastest growing economy (7.6%) among the G20 nations by 2017. With slower economic growth in China, the confederation called India â€œa bright spot among more downbeat emerging markets". Notably, the G20 nations have cumulatively invested $73.9 billion in India in 2000-2015.
