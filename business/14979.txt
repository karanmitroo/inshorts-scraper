Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday announced recalling about 625,000 hybrid cars globally, to fix a glitch in the software of the hybrid system that may, in some cases, shut down while the car is being driven. The affected models include Prius alpha (called Prius+ in a few markets) which was manufactured between May 2010 and November 2014.
