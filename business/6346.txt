Jewellery chain Tiffany abruptly replaced CEO Frederic Cumenal after disappointing financial results, just before the company launched a new campaign with its first Super Bowl ad in history. Chairman and former CEO Michael Kowalski would serve as interim CEO. In order to expand sales, Tiffany commissioned pop singer Lady Gaga to become the face of its fashion-jewellery collection.
