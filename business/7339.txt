US President-elect Donald Trump has picked oil giant Exxon Mobil's CEO Rex Tillerson as the next Secretary of State. Trump's team also dismissed concerns over Tillerson's close ties with Russia. Tillerson, who was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013, has opposed US sanctions against Russia and has connections with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
