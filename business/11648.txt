PM Narendra Modi on Sunday launched the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh. The ₹8,000 crore scheme aims to provide five crore free cooking gas (LPG) connections to below poverty line (BPL) families between 2016-19. It will be partly funded by money saved from 1.13 crore LPG users voluntarily giving up subsidies through the ‘Give It Up’ initiative.
