The response to government's Income Declaration Scheme (IDS) for black money has been "beyond expectations", an Income-Tax official said on Friday. The four-month window under the scheme, which allows taxpayers to declare undisclosed wealth and avail immunity from prosecution, closes today at midnight. Reportedly, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will disclose exact declaration amounts on Saturday.
