Online marketplace Amazon India will reportedly foray into the grocery delivery service market before April this year. The company has partnered with several retailers for the same and aims at delivering groceries within two hours of receiving orders. Notably, Amazon had soft-launched 'Kirana Now', its quick-delivery platform of consumer need products, last March in select locations in Bengaluru.
