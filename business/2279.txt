Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation delisted the juice brand 'Fresca' after former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi complained that he found filth in a juice served in Shatabdi train. Trivedi said passengers are provided with poor quality services even after railways introduced flexi fares. He added that railways need to keep a check so that departments' accountability is maintained.
