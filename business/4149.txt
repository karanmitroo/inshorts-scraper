Former RBI Governor YV Reddy has revealed that he offered the position of deputy governor to Raghuram Rajan in 2004, which he rejected. Reddy said he explained to Rajan that “we would require somebody like him...virtually hinting that he could one day be the governor”. Rajan, who was IMF's Chief Economist then, joined RBI as its 23rd governor in 2013.
