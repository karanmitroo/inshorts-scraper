The Delhi High Court has indefinitely adjourned the hearing of pleas challenging the Centre's decision to demonetise high-value currency notes. This comes after the Supreme Court stayed all proceedings pending before different courts on related issues. The high court ruled this while hearing a petition which had sought a direction to the Centre to ensure that all  ATMs dispense cash.
