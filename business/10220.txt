The Madras High Court today upheld the Telecom Department's right to ‘modify’ licence conditions and seek revenue earned by service providers from non-telecom activities worth ₹3,273 crore. The court said it is the government's "exclusive privilege" to grant licences. Service providers like Aircel had objected to the modifications including paying a percentage of gross revenue as licence fee.
