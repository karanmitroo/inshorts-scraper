Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said some people have multiple PAN cards and making Aadhaar mandatory for filing tax returns will stop tax fraud. Further, Aadhaar may become the only card in the future, replacing other identity cards like voter ID, he added. Notably, a bill making Aadhaar mandatory for I-T returns and PAN was passed in Lok Sabha.
