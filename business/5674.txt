Embattled Air Costa has seen an exodus of employees, including 40 pilots, in the last few weeks over non-payment of salaries. Air Costa promoters had "promised" to pay pending salaries by March 15, but "failed" to keep their word. Notably, faced with a cash crunch, Air Costa has cancelled bookings till May, and is looking for funds to restart operations.
