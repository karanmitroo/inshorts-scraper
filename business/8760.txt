A special court on Monday pulled up the CBI for not filing a progress report of its probe in a coal scam case involving Congress leader Naveen Jindal, ex-MoS for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao and others. Further, the court questioned the CBI's investigating officer why the case diary wasn't properly maintained and why some investigation details weren't mentioned in it.
