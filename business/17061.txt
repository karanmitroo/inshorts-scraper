Apple posted a profit of $7.7 billion on revenue of $37.4 billion in the three months period to Jun-28, an increase of 11.6% from a year ago. The company said it sold 35.2 million iPhones in the quarter, a rise of nearly 13% from the same period a year earlier. However, the soft demand for iPads also hurt revenues.
