The Income Tax Department has told the Delhi High Court that Nokia's offer to pay a minimum deposit of Rs 2,250 crore, against the Finnish mobile maker's total tax liability of nearly Rs 6,500 crore, is not acceptable. However, Nokia reiterated that it could not pay more. The court listed the matter for December 9.
