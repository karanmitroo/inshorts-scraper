UK-based liquor company Diageo and two of its subsidiaries on Wednesday filed objections in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) against its March order barring Vijay Mallya from accessing the $75 million settlement he was to receive from Diageo. The tribunal had ordered that the amount be attached until the disposal of the case over loan default by Mallya-led Kingfisher Airlines.
