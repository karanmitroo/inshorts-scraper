A US judge has held United Parcel Service liable for illegally shipping 6,83,000 cartons of untaxed cigarettes in New York, depriving the state and New York City of millions of dollars in taxes. UPS allegedly shipped untaxed "contraband" cigarette cartons to unlicensed wholesalers, retailers and residences since 2010. UPS' "high degree of culpability" means "significant penalties", the judge said.
