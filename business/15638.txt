Indian Railways subsidiary, IRCTC, that handles its catering, tourism and online ticketing operations, has brought on board Pizza Hut and KFC to deliver pre-ordered meals to passengers. These vendors will take orders from customers through IRCTC's website, 48 hours prior to the date of journey. Initially, the service will start in trains that do not have a pantry car.
