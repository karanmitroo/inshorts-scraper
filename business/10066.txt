Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday asserted that newly appointed RBI Governor Urjit Patel will "successfully lead the Reserve Bank" and "contribute to Indiaâ€™s economic development". NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant also called Patel a "great choice" as he has a good understanding of India's macroeconomic scenario. Notably, Patel will succeed Raghuram Rajan as the 24th Governor of the RBI.
