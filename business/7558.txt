Swiss food conglomerate Nestl√© claims that it has found a way to slash the sugar content in some of its chocolates by 40% without compromising their taste. The firm has reportedly discovered a way "to structure sugar differently" due to which sugar dissolves faster, and the tongue perceives a higher level of sweetness, even if less sugar is consumed.
