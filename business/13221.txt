IDBI bank on Saturday said it has raised ₹900 crore via issuing Basel-III compliant bonds "to strengthen the bank’s capital adequacy". Basel-III, which is a global framework on stress testing and capital adequacy, was introduced in India's banking system in 2013 to improve risk management. Fitch ratings suggests India needs further $140 billion to ensure full Basel-III compliance by 2019.
