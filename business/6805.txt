Low-cost airline SpiceJet would not “go crazy” about market share and will focus on remaining profitable in a responsible manner, Chairman Ajay Singh said. “Market share will happen as we increase our planes and flights,” he stated. Notably, with seven straight quarters of profit after being near closure in 2015, SpiceJet is currently fourth in terms of domestic market share.
