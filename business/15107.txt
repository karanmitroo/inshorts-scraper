Following PM Modi's China visit, India will reportedly be soon exporting beef to its north-eastern neighbour. A team of inspectors from Beijing is expected to visit India and examine meat processing units in July, as bovine meat was previously denied entry to the country for alleged foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. India may also export pomegranate, non-basmati rice, okra and cucumber.
