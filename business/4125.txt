Samples from three major coffee chains in the UK, namely Costa Coffee, Starbucks, and Caffe Nero, have been found to contain faecal bacteria. An investigation revealed that iced water from the three chains contained faecal bacteria, with a positive test found for seven out of 10 samples from Costa and three out of 10 samples from the other two chains.
