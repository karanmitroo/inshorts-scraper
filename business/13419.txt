Amidst falling oil prices, the government on Wednesday raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹0.30 and ₹1.17 per litre respectively. The increase would yield an additional ₹2,500 crore in revenue during the remaining part of the ongoing fiscal, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. This is the second hike in excise duty in six weeks.
