Ralph Lauren CEO Stefan Larsson will step down from his position in May because of differences with the founder over the direction of the luxury brand. He was hired as the CEO less than two years ago. The company said the departure was mutually agreed upon. Notably, Larsson was the first CEO of the company other than Ralph Lauren himself.
