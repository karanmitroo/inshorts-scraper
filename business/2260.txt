The Railways Ministry has decided to extend service charge exemption on train tickets booked online till March 2018. In an attempt to encourage online bookings, the government had waived the service charges, which range from ₹20-₹40 per ticket, after demonetisation last year. Almost 33% of the IRCTC revenue comes from the service charge collected on online bookings, according to officials.
