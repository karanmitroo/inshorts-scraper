The government's demonetisation decision had “little impact” on India’s growth and the economy will continue to grow at 7-8%, eminent economist Lord Meghnad Desai said. Desai claimed that he supported demonetisation, stating, "I proposed it myself back in 2004." “I would advise other economies to try demonetisation, but (go for) better arrangements for introduction of new currency," he added.
