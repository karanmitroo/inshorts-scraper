The richest 0.1% of the world's population have increased their combined wealth by as much as the poorest 50% between 1980 and 2016, according to a report by French economist Thomas Piketty. Moreover, the richest 1% captured 27% of the world's wealth growth between the said period while top 0.001%, about 76,000 people, collected 4% of all the new wealth.
