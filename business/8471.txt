Greece’s power utility firm Public Power Corporation said on Wednesday that China’s State Grid was the highest bidder for a 24% stake sale in the country’s power grid operator ADMIE, offering €320 million. PPC fully owns ADMIE and under the Greece’s international bailout terms, PPC must either sell its stake in the grid, or fully privatise it by next year.
