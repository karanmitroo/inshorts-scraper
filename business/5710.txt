The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75% to 1.00%. This was reportedly facilitated by steady economic growth and confidence that inflation is rising as per target. Notably, inflation is "close" to the Fed's 2% target.
