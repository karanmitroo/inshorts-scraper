Telecom major Vodafone India has said it will launch 4G services across 2,400 towns and eight additional telecom circles by March 2017, instead of 1,000 towns as announced earlier. “We have enhanced our 4G roll out plans following the spectrum auction," CEO Sunil Sood stated. Notably, Vodafone had acquired spectrum worth ₹20,280 crore in India's biggest spectrum auction.
