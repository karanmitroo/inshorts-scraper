Germany-based Deutsche Bank's CFO Marcus Schenck on Monday said the bank must work on resolving its own problems before making any acquisitions, adding, "We still have all sorts of homework to do." Further, "You do M&A (mergers and acquisitions) once things have been cleaned up," Schenck stated. Notably, Deutsche Bank was facing a $14 billion probe by US authorities.
