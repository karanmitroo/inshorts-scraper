The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday warned that central banks worldwide are struggling to tackle deflationary forces and that governments need to spend more. IMF attributed the deflationary pressures in many nations to the sinking prices of both commodities and manufactured goods. Deflation challenges the central banksâ€™ ability to use monetary policy to stimulate demand, IMF further added.
