Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen on Tuesday raised questions on Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) autonomy and said the central bank doesn't decide anything and all decisions are taken by PM Narendra Modi. Sen further said the RBI was quite independent when Raghuram Rajan was Governor. He said it's puzzling why the government demonetised 86% currency to eliminate 6% black money.
