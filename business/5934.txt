Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said one doesn’t want a situation where there are one or two “healthy” telecom operators, while another similar number struggle, and the rest “three or four are in the ICU". Large countries only need three service providers, he stated. "You really want a few sustainable solid operators" who can induce the required investments, Mittal added.
