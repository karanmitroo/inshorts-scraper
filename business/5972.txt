Acquisition of Telenor's India operations will have an "immaterial impact" on Bharti Airtel's financial position because of limited rise in debt and gains in revenue, S&P Global Ratings said. It will help Airtel increase its revenue market share by two percentage points to about 35%. Airtel will take over Telenor Indiaâ€™s spectrum, licences and operations, and 4.4 crore customer base.
