Civil society activists Aruna Roy, Medha Patkar, and Prashant Bhushan have urged the Centre not to approve the release of genetically modified (GM) mustard. They said that the country’s biotech regulator had adopted “non-scientific, opaque, and deceptive” methods while studying the crop's impact. This comes after a sub-committee, formed by the regulator, recently ruled GM mustard as safe.
