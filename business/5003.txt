The Delhi High Court has rejected RBI's intervention plea while accepting the terms of consent of settlement between NTT DoCoMo and Tata Sons over payment of $1.18 billion in damages to the former. RBI had contested the payment to DoCoMo, saying it amounted to transfer of shares and was illegal. The case relates to a two-year-old dispute between the firms.
