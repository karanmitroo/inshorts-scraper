Promoters of Infosys, led by Co-founder and former Chairman Narayana Murthy, lost over ₹2,870 crore in paper wealth on Friday. This came after stocks of the IT giant plunged almost 10% following Vishal Sikka's exit as CEO, for which the board of the company blamed Murthy. Overall, Infosys shareholders lost over ₹22,500 crore on Friday after Sikka’s unexpected resignation.
