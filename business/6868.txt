Maharashtra on Monday extended the deadline for submission of bids by 15 days after receiving just one bid for the Navi Mumbai International Airport. Hiranandani Group subsidiary Voluptas Developers, GMR Group and Tata Realty, though had qualified for bidding, pulled out citing uncertainties and delays in the project. This is the fourth time the submission deadline has been extended.
