Australia's largest bank Commonwealth Bank of Australia has admitted to allegations of breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws made by the Australian government. The bank admitted it was late to disclose over 53,000 transactions of A$10,000 or more through its deposit-taking ATMs between 2012 and 2015. The bank blamed a "coding error" for the problem.
