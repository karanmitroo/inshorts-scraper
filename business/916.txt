The Union Cabinet on Wednesday allowed 49% foreign direct investment (FDI) in state-owned Air India under the approval route. The earlier policy allowed foreign airlines to hold up to 49% stake in Indian carriers with the exception of Air India. The government added that substantial ownership and effective control of Air India will remain with Indian nationals.
