Gold price rose by ₹990 to a 10-month high of ₹31,350 per ten gram on Friday in the national capital, witnessing the biggest one-day surge this year. This rise came after the dollar fell to its weakest level since 2015. Silver also surged to ₹42,000 per kg backed by increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
