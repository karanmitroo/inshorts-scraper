Keeping its poll promise, the NDA govt allocated Rs 7,600 crore for developing 100 smart cities. “The pace of migration to the cities is increasing. Unless new cities are developed, the existing cities would soon become unlivable,” Jaitley said. Also, the allocation for urban infrastructure and governance has been raised to Rs 17,628 crore compared with Rs 7,548 in 2012-13.
