The manager of a Pizza Hut outlet in Florida posted a note threatening to punish workers who attempted to evacuate over 24 hours ahead of Hurricane Irma. "Failure to show for these shifts...will be considered a no show and documentation will be issued," the note read. "In the event of an evacuation, you MUST return within 72 HOURS," it added.
