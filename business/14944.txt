The Tata group has offered to buy out Japanese telecom firm Docomoâ€™s 26.5% stake in Tata Teleservices for Rs 23.34 a share, after the RBI rejected its application regarding a deal at Rs 58 a share. Docomo is insisting on the pre-agreed valuation, which would translate into Rs 7,200 crore for its entire stake in Tata Teleservices.
