Investment bank Goldman Sachs on Wednesday forecasted Indiaâ€™s GDP to grow at 7.9% in the next fiscal, driven by increased spending on infrastructure by the government and growth in domestic demand. Goldman, however, added that it expects "further depreciation" in the rupee. It also expressed "upside risks to inflation" due to higher growth in consumption than production.
