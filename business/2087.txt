US authorities filed fraud charges against mining giant Rio Tinto, former CEO Tom Albanese and ex-CFO Guy Elliott, claiming they inflated value of coal assets acquired in 2011. Rio had bought Mozambique assets for $3.7 billion and later sold them for $50 million. By making misleading claims, Rio was able to raise $5.5 billion from US investors, the authorities said.
