India is 'poised' to reach double-digit growth rate in the next three years despite the rise in GDP being below expectations in the first quarter of 2016-17, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said on Thursday. India can grow at the rate of around 10%, if the government continues with certain reforms and if the global economy picks up, he added.
