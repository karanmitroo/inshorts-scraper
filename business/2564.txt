Tata Sons has reportedly sought shareholders' approval to amend its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association to convert itself from a public limited company to a private limited one. Tata Sons requires 75% votes in favour of the resolution to change its corporate structure. Further, the change in status will also need approval from the National Company Law Tribunal.
