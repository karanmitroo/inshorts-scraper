A group representing workers in the IT sector has submitted a petition to the Tamil Nadu government accusing Cognizant of "illegal termination" of employees. The Forum for IT Employees (FITE) has alleged that Cognizant has been forcing employees to resign. Notably, this comes after reports said Cognizant is looking to lay off 6,000 workers in India.
