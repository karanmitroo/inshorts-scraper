Mercedes-Benz has apologised to Chinese consumers over a social media post which quoted Dalai Lama, whom China considers a separatist. The German carmaker did not mention Dalai Lama but said it was sorry for "wrong information" that "hurt the feelings of Chinese people". Mercedes also clarified that it apologised on its own and was not approached by Chinese authorities.
