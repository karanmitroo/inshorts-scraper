The Central Trade Unions (CTUs) have decided to boycott the two-day BRICS Labour and Employment Ministerial meeting which begins on Tuesday. The unions cited the government (the Labour Ministry) not formally inviting them for the summit as the reason for the boycott. The meeting will deliberate on issues including job creation and social security for workers, reports said.
