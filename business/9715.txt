Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, while warning against lower interest rates, has said that such measures by central banks cannot substitute other policy instruments and broader reforms. According to Rajan, low interest rates globally could distort markets. Further, they would be difficult to abandon as countries could become “trapped” by the fear of growth slowdown on raising rates, he added.
