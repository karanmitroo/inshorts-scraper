Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy on Tuesday said it is extremely important to spend less than what one earns. He further said, "Everybody, starting from the chairman and CEO to a janitor...will have to demonstrate simplicity, to scale up companies' growth." "Once you start doing it, then revenues will increase significantly and cost will be under control," he added.
