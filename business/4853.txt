Liquor baron and wilful defaulter Vijay Mallya used around 40 companies to siphon off more than ₹100 crore abroad, according to a report which quoted a senior Enforcement Directorate official. Notably, Mallya was on Tuesday ordered by the Supreme Court to appear in person on July 10. Mallya's now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes more than ₹9,000 crore to various banks.
