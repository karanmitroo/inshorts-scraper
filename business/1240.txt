Vijay Mallya's lawyer on Thursday told a London court that Indian jails are over-crowded and are infested with rats, cockroaches, and snakes. The lawyer further presented the court with instances of violence and ill treatment in some jails. The issue of medical assistance in the jails was also raised, after stating that Mallya suffers from diabetes and a heart disease.
