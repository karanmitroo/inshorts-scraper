Reliance Jio has alleged that incumbents are using “unfair and deceptive” methods like lining-up customised retention offers for subscribers willing to move out of their network. In a letter to TRAI, Jio asked it to take “strongest action” against three operators, namely Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea. It also asked TRAI to recommend “highest penalty” for "gross violation" of licence norms.
