The Centre’s LED bulb programme Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) will be implemented across India by 2019, Power Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said. This will ensure an annual benefit of ₹40,000 crore in electricity bills, he added. The government has distributed nine crore LED bulbs under the scheme since its launch last year, Goyal further informed.
