A study by ASSOCHAM has revealed that the Indian stock market is excessively dependent on foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and the retail investor participation is poor. Moreover, the study shows that retail investor confidence in the equity market does not see chances of restoration in near future. FIIs reportedly resulted in a net inflow of Rs.1,00,577 crore till Dec-6.
