Airtel faced backlash from customers after its official Twitter handle posted two tweets on the occasion of Diwali. One tweet read, "Join us in the fight against pollution," while another wished customers a "noise-free Diwali". Following this, users wrote, "This is terrible. Don't get into faith and feelings of we Hindus" and "I want a Airtel less Diwali".
