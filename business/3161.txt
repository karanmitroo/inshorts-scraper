Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is considering to reduce Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC), which is the fee mobile operators pay for connecting calls, from 14 paise per minute to under 10 paise per minute. The charges are usually borne by users. Notably, Airtel chief Sunil Mittal in a letter to TRAI wrote, "The current IUC regime...is already below cost."
