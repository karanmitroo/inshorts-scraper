Telecom major Airtel's Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said the merger of Vodafone and Idea Cellular, if it were to indeed materialise, would be a "perfect match". "[I]f you look at it, the match is not bad," he said. "The strength and weaknesses match very well. Rural-urban, structured portfolio...makes for a good business case and I would support it," Mittal added.
