Biocon Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said, "KFA (Kingfisher Airlines) should have shut shop much earlier and Mallya would have avoided this mess." Defending Vijay Mallya, she said entrepreneurs were in denial when it came to business failures. "I will never defend fraud but a genuine business failure should be settled fairly. If Mallya is guilty... he must pay up," Shaw added.
