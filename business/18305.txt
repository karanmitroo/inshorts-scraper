Rising for the fourth-straight day, the sensex increased by 684.48 points to close at nearly 3-year high of 20,646.64 on Thursday. The gain was related to massive buying in interest-sensitive sectors after US Fed's decision to leave economic stimulus untouched spurred hopes that RBI will ease monetary policy on Friday. Meanwhile, the rupee also gained 150-paise to close at 61.80/dollar.
