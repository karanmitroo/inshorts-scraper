Hailing PM Narendra Modi for scrapping ₹1,000 and ₹500 currency notes, Baba Ramdev on Tuesday said printing of ₹2,000 notes should also be stopped in future. "The adverse effect of high denomination currency is evident as fake ₹2,000 notes have arrived," said Ramdev. "Fake currency in high denomination is convenient for printing, transportation and difficult to trace," he added.
