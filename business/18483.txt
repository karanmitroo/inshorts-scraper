The CAG has written to the petroleum ministry seeking its intervention after the Reliance India Ltd-(RIL) refused to share some documents about purchases of its D-6 gas-fields in Krishna-Godavari basin. Last year also, CAG had to write to the ministry. The government had then put on hold all expansion plans at the D-6 till RIL agreed to provide required documents.
