Tax body Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has introduced a new mechanism under which top officers of the Income Tax department will "personally examine" a specific quota of tax-related grievances every week from their origin to resolution. This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently expressed that "high-level monitoring of public grievances is necessary".
