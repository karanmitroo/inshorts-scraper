Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) has asked Indian telecom regulator TRAI to issue an "immediate direction to BSNL for withdrawing its app-based calling service." The newly-launched Fixed Mobile Telephony service lets customers make calls while connected to a BSNL broadband modem using a smartphone app. "Such routing with an app number is not allowed under the licence," claimed COAI.
