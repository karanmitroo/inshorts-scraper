The RBI on Thursday announced a new uniform methodology to ensure better responsiveness by banks to its policy rate changes. The new rules, expected to make loans cheaper, would take effect from April 1. RBI earlier said that while it has cut its repo rate by 125 basis points in 2015, banks have reduced lending rates by only 60 points.
