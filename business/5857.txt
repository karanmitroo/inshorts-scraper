The Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) former Chairman UK Sinha said that at the start of his tenure, people would introduce him as the chairperson of SBI (State Bank of India). However, "Today, you go to a small village in India and they know SEBI," he stated. Sinha's six-year tenure as SEBI Chairman ended last week.
