United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency (FSA) gave a clean chit to Nestle India's Maggi, buoying the beleaguered Indian manufacturer's shares by 3% during intra-day trade on Thursday. Nestle's shares witnessed an upswing of 1.78% in BSE, following FSA's confirmation that "the product is well within EU permissible levels and would not be a concern to consumers."
