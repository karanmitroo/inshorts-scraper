Sahara chief Subrata Roy requested the Supreme Court Thursday to move him from the prisoners' barracks to the guest house inside Tihar Jail, to enable him to meet prospective buyers for three hotels in London and New York. Permission was also sought to install adequate communication facilities inside the guest house for the buyers, at Sahara's expense.
