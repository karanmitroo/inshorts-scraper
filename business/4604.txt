The CEO of British Airways Alex Cruz on Monday ruled out resigning after the airline saw a global IT outage over the weekend. Further, he maintained that the computer glitch had nothing to do with cutting costs or outsourcing IT services to India. Notably, the global IT glitch affected over 1,000 British Airways flights and resulted in long delays.
