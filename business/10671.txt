Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said a "sizeable dip" in Indian black money stashed abroad has been reported. The Centre's “activism” over the last two years, including a four-month compliance window for declaring undisclosed assets, has helped the matter, he said. Co-operation by the G-20 countries and technological progress will make it difficult to generate black money, Jaitley added.
