Volkswagen announced that it plans to update the engines of the 3 lakh cars that it had recalled in India. The carmaker had ordered the recall after a government probe found its diesel engines equipped with a 'defeat device' to cheat emission tests. The recall covers the cars sold between 2008 and November 2015 in India.
