The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Wednesday to cut oil output by over 2% to 32.5 million barrels per day, in the first cut since 2008, according to reports. Global crude oil prices jumped over 5% after OPEC nations agreed to cut output amid a global oversupply after sanctions against Iran were lifted last year.
