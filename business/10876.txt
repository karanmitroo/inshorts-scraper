BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said he ‘suspends’ his demand of sacking Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian if the government considers him "patriotic" despite his attempts of trying to “twist India's arm”. Swamy tweeted, "If BJP Union govt says...we know all about AS but still he is an asset, then I will…wait for events to prove [the] truth".
