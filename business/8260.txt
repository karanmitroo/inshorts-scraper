Economic think-tank NCAER has pegged India’s GDP growth at 7.6% for 2016-17, following a pick-up in rural demand and “positive signals” on the manufacturing front. NCAER said the anticipated improvement in the agricultural sector and the associated increase in rural demand will give an upward push to economic growth. Notably, the Monetary Policy Committee has also forecasted a 7.6% growth.
