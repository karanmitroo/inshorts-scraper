The Department of Posts (DoP) is planning to open 1,000 ATMs and bring all 25,000 departmental post offices under core banking system (CBS) by March this year, a DoP official said. CBS will enable customers to operate their accounts and avail banking services from any post office on the CBS network, regardless of where they maintain their account.
