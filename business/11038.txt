UK's High Court has been told that financial firm Goldman Sachs paid for prostitutes and five-star hotels while attempting to gain business from the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). Goldman Sachs reportedly executed nine trades for the LIA in 2008, in which the LIA lost almost all its investment, while Goldman Sachs ended up with profits of more than $200 million.
