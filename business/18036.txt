About 4,500 Indians have been exposed to metal poisoning and discomfort after being fitted with faulty hip-implants manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. However, unlike in the US, where 8,000 patients were compensated with $2.5 billion, in India compensation has not been discussed at all. The Maharashtra Food and Drug Association have written to the CBI to take over the case.
