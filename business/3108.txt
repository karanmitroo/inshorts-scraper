Volkswagen India on Thursday submitted a roadmap before National Green Tribunal (NGT) to recall over 3.23 lakh vehicles fitted with a 'defeat device' meant to cheat emission tests. The roadmap was submitted in pursuance to the NGT's direction passed on Wednesday. Volkswagen India had recalled these vehicles fitted with EA-189 diesel engines which were in alleged violation of emission norms.
