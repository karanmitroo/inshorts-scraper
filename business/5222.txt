American International Group board of directors declined to award CEO Peter Hancock a cash bonus for his work last year, after the company's dismal financial performance. Hancock, however, will still receive a total of nearly $9.6 million (â‚¹62 crore) in 2016 compensation, according to a filing. Notably, his total compensation fell by as much as 23% from 2015.
