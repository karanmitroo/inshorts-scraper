Telecom operator Vodafone has told the Delhi High Court that it would amend its plea to challenge telecom regulator TRAI's orders giving a clean chit to the free offers of Reliance Jio. The submission was made after Jio contended that Vodafone had not challenged decisions of TRAI, which held that its free offers did not violate any tariff norms.
