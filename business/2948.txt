Referring to Co-founder Narayana Murthy's criticism, former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka said, "When this sort of public questioning of governance, of fundamental, structural things starts...the long-timers start to wonder, who is really in charge here?" "You cannot have that. So that was the issue," he said in an interview. He further stated that he felt undermined by criticism from Murthy.
