According to a report by Mint, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will make it difficult for so-called wilful defaulters from raising fresh equity or debt from the public. Sebi will, however, allow such entities to raise funds through rights issues or share sales to institutional investors, provided the entity discloses itself as a wilful defaulter.
