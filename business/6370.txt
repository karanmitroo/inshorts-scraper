A lawsuit has been filed against Johnson & Johnson's Mentor Worldwide unit for selling defective breast implants, having leaks which harmed thousands of women. The unit failed to conduct studies mandated by government regulators, it claimed. Notably, Mentor was among the three companies authorised to sell silicone implants in US after a 14-year ban on them was lifted in 2006.
