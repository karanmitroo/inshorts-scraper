The government on Tuesday said, "At present, there is no proposal to make Aadhaar linkage mandatory in property transactions." Earlier, after PM Modi had hinted at a crackdown on Benami properties, there were reports of making Aadhaar linkage mandatory for property transactions. Recently, the government extended the deadline for linking Aadhaar to all services and government schemes to March 31.
