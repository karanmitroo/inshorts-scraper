German publishing house Axel Springer is reportedly set to buy American news website Business Insider for around $560 million. Founded by former Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget, the website had sold 7% of its stake to Axel Springer in January when it had received a funding of $25 million. The transaction is expected to close within a few weeks.
