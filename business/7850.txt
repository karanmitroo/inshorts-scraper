The Delhi government has issued strict instructions to all private hospitals to accept cheques, demand drafts and online payments from patients. The government's order came amid complaints that some hospitals were not accepting cheques and demand drafts following demonetisation, thereby causing inconvenience to patients. Notably, only state-run hospitals can accept old ₹500 and ₹1000 notes.
