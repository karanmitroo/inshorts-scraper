Petrol pumps will continue to accept credit and debit cards for fuel purchase till January 13, according to reports. Earlier, the All India Petroleum Dealers Association decided to not accept card payments at petrol pumps starting January 9 in protest against the 1% transaction fee charged by banks. After the government intervened, banks agreed to not charge the fee temporarily.
