The state-run Bank of India has extended a loan of $200 million to Air India to finance the acquisition of three Dreamliners, official sources said on Sunday. Notably, this is the first time that Indian banks have started evincing interest in financing aircraft purchase. The national carrier would use the amount to acquire three Boeing 787s.
