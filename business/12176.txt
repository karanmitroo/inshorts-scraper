The government on Sunday announced the revival of nine stranded gas-based power plants (SGPs) with an installed capacity of 5,942 MW. The plants will supply power at or below â‚¹4.70 per unit to the distribution companies between April and September, the Power Ministry said. This is the third such SGP auction as the first two were held last year.
