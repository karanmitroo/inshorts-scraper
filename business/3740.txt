The government has recently transferred 325 commissioners of the Income Tax department across the country. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which frames policy for the tax department, has brought out two lists, transferring 80 and subsequently 245 commissioner rank officials. This is reportedly the largest scale of transfers done in the department in the last few years.
