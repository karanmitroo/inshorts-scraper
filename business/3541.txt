US food chain Chipotle said that a sick employee is believed to be the cause of a Norovirus outbreak that forced the chain to briefly close a restaurant in Virginia last week. Some workers reportedly said they were forced to work while they were ill. This comes after a video showing rodents falling from a Chipotle restaurant ceiling went viral.
