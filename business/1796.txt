The Supreme Court has rejected a plea by Jaypee Associates to deposit ₹400 crore with the court registry to compensate homebuyers. The company was seeking to deposit the money in parts towards the ₹2,000 crore that it had been directed to pay. SC has asked Jaypee Group to deposit at least ₹1,000 crore by November 13 before seeking any extension.
