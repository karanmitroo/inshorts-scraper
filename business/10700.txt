Packaged food giant PepsiCo on Thursday posted a quarterly profit of $2.01 billion as against $1.98 billion last year for the quarter ended June. The company's net revenue declined by 3.3% year-on-year to $15.4 billion. The profit rose amid lowered costs and new products responding to growing interests in "craft" options, generating 9% of PepsiCo's revenue, the company said.
