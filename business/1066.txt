The presence of foreign bank ATMs in India has declined by 18% from 1,141 to 934 between September 2014 and September 2017, according to RBI data. The reason for the reduction is mainly due to banks like the UK-based Royal Bank of Scotland and South Africa-based FirstRand Bank closing their retail operations in India.
