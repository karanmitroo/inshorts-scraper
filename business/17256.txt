Nita Ambani (50), wife of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Wednesday became the first woman to be appointed on the board of the nation's largest private company. The appointment helps RIL meet a new law requiring listed companies to have at least one woman in the boardroom to boost gender diversity. Nita took the place of Mukesh's uncle Ramniklal Ambani.
