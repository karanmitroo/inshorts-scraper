Paul Romer, World Bank's Chief Economist was ousted from its research arm, Development Economics Group, after staff rebelled against demands to write concisely. Romer told staff the bankâ€™s World Development Report wouldn't be published if the use of the word "and" exceeded 2.6%. He also demanded shorter emails and cut staff off if they talked for too long during presentations.
