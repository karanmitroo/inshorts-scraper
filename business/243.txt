The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has denied reports claiming that it is implementing a 13-digit mobile number system for consumers. It clarified that a directive for 13-digit number system was issued exclusively for machine-to-machine (M2M) SIM cards used for direct communication among electronic devices. The directive will have no impact on the existing 10-digit consumer mobile numbers.
