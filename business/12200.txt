Unseasonal rains and hailstorms could cause a 14% drop in India's annual wheat produce from government estimates of 93.8 million tons, industry body ASSOCHAM said in a statement on Friday. The body further encouraged the government to slash import duty on wheat to supplement domestic shortage and keep prices stable in the world's second-largest producer of the grain.
