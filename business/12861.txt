Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha on Saturday said that the Indian economy can grow by 8% in the 2016-17 fiscal year as long as there is a favourable monsoon after two years of drought. “We should see it adding 0.5-1% to GDP growth,” he added, while speaking on the sidelines of the Economic Times Global Business Summit.
