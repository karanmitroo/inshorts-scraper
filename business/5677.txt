A parliamentary panel has sought a probe into Kingfisher Airlines' accumulation of high levels of dues to Airports Authority of India, which was in "violation of all existing rules". At the end of 2016, the airline owed dues worth nearly â‚¹295 crore to AAI, which have been written off. Notably, Kingfisher Airlines was shut in 2012 due to financial troubles.
