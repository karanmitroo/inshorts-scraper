The US Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged at the range of 0.25%-0.50% on Wednesday. It signaled that it was concerned about global growth and the recent market turbulence, but it didnâ€™t explicitly rule out an interest rate increase at its next meeting in March. US government bonds gained in price while US stocks sold off following the announcement.
