Banking services firm HSBC is planning to wind up its participatory notes (P-notes) operations in India. This comes after a committee set up by the bank suggested that incomes from P-note operations would decline in the next five years as the new norms have resulted in escalation of costs and regulatory burden. HSBC is among the top five P-notes issuers.
