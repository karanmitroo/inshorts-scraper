Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said India is ready to invest over $15.2 billion in Iran provided Tehran offers cheaper gas. He said India is seeking gas at $1.50 per million British thermal units against $2.95 quoted by Iran for building a urea plant there. Urea import would help India reduce subsidy and halve the price, he added.
