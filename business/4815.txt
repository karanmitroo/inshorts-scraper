The Enforcement Directorate will file a supplementary request to extradite Vijay Mallya from UK and will base its case on money laundering evidence, reports said. "[I]f the money laundering charge is not included in the extradition case...Mallya cannot be tried for it once he is back," an official stated. Notably, Mallya left India in 2016, owing â‚¹9,000 crore to banks.
