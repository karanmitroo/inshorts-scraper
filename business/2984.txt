Ravin Gandhi, an Indian-origin CEO in the US was racially abused after he wrote an article saying he won't defend US President Donald Trump’s economic agenda after the violence in Charlottesville. "You’re a f***ing Indian pig" and "Get your f***ing garbage and go back to India, and sell it there" were some of the comments/emails Gandhi got from Trump supporters.
