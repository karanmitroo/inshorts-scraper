PwC has settled a $3 billion (â‚¹20,000 crore) malpractice suit with the administrator of former client MF Global. PwC was the auditor of MF Global, which collapsed in 2011 after making bets on debt of Italy and other nations during the eurozone debt crisis. MF Global alleged it relied on PwC's accounting advice when it bought bonds of the countries.
