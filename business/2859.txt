Former CFO of Infosys V Balakrishnan has said the company's founders participating in the â‚¹13,000 crore buyback does not give any wrong signal to shareholders. He said their participation will ensure the economic interests of all shareholders will remain at same levels. Balakrishnan earlier said it looked "unusual" that Infosys board announced buyback offer just before Vishal Sikka's resignation.
