P2P lending is a crowdfunding model used to raise loans using an online platform that matches lenders with borrowers to provide unsecured loans. The government has said peer-to-peer lending (P2P) platforms would be treated as non-banking financial companies and regulated by RBI.  P2P lending firms hold the lenders' money before giving it out to borrowers, usually individuals and small businesses.
