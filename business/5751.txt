British pharma company GlaxoSmithKline's first woman CEO Emma Walmsley will earn less than her predecessor Andrew Witty due to lack of experience at the helm, the company said. Walmsley will be paid an annual base salary of about $1.2 million, against Witty's $1.4 million pay. Her bonus will also be capped so that it doesn't exceed her salary.
