The UK and Welsh governments on Thursday offered to part-nationalise Tata Steel UK by acquiring an equity stake of up to 25% in the company, as part of the financing measures to help it find a “credible private buyer”. They also proposed debt financing at commercial rates and grants for equipment, to make up the bulk of the financial support.
