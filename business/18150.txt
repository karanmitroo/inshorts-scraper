Infosys has agreed to pay $34 million in penalties to settle visa violations and I-9 paperwork errors that were subject to investigation from the US justice department. Infosys was accused of using B-1 visas, meant for short business visits, instead of harder-to-get and costlier H-1B work-visas to bring staffs for long term stay in US; though Infosys denied the charges.
