Reliance Communications Chairman Anil Ambani's wealth increased by $82 million (₹528 crore) this year, even as its shares plummeted 39%, wiping $513 million (₹3,300 crore) from its valuation. This is because gains at Reliance Capital and Reliance Power outstripped losses at RCom. Moreover, RCom, which is facing a ₹47,332 crore debt, said it would repay ₹25,000 crore before September 30.
