According to a study conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute, India's 2025 GDP can be increased by $700 billion-$2.9 trillion by enabling women to participate in the economy at par with men. With women constituting 23-24% of the workforce, Indian women generate 17% of the country's GDP, unlike the global average where women generate 37% of the worldâ€™s GDP.
