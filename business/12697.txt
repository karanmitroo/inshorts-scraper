Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is in talks to invest $500 million to boost the output of Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas firm Petróleos de Venezuela. The company’s overseas arm ONGC Videsh owns a 40% stake in the cash-strapped South American country’s San Cristobal field in the Orinoco Belt, which has the world’s largest deposits of petroleum.
