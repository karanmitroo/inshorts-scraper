China's fiscal revenue growth slumped to a 23-year low of 8.6% in the last year, hit by sluggish demand in the world's second largest economy and a fragile global market. The country's fiscal revenue stood at $2.3 trillion in 2014 compared to $2.11 trillion in 2013. China's economy grew 7.4% last year -- its weakest expansion in 24 years.
