The BSE Sensex plunged 363 points to 25,902.20 and Nifty declined 114 points to 7,839.60 during morning trade on Monday. Notably, the Sensex had opened about 600 points down. According to reports, JD(U)-led grand alliance's victory in Bihar Assembly elections was the primary cause of the fall as it may increase uncertainty over economic reforms by the BJP-led central government.
