American retailer Walmart on Friday said it will stop selling Egyptian cotton sheets made by Indian manufacturer Welspun India after they were unable to assure Walmart of the product's authenticity. Earlier, American retailer Target had severed ties with Welspun over allegations of selling fraudulent Egyptian cotton sheets, while another retailer ordered an external audit of Welspun's textiles.
