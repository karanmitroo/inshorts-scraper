A Tanzanian probe has claimed that the local unit of Airtel was originally transferred from the state illegally. Tanzania's Finance Minister Philip Mpango said the initial privatisation of Tanzania Telecommunications was "dirty and terrible" and Tanzania was conned and "a lot of money" was lost. Airtel earlier said it had gained all government approvals for the acquisition of the company.
