UK PM Theresa May said she will not raise the visa quota for Indians, citing that "9 out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted". She added that the UK already issues "more work visas to India than... US, Australia and China put together." This comes despite Indian professionals asking for more six-month visas for the UK.
