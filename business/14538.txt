According to media reports, Facebook has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount in an out-of-court settlement to the father of a girl, from Northern Ireland, who was allegedly "exposed to online sexual predators at the age of 11". He sued Facebook for not implementing the age restriction policy and a trial was due to begin last week after four years.
