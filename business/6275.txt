Apple's CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday said that Steve Jobs was the son of an immigrant. Cook was referring to Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs' father, Abdulfattah John Jandali, who was born and raised in Syria. Cook's statement comes a few days after he told his employees that "Apple would not exist without immigration" citing US President Donald Trump's immigration ban.
