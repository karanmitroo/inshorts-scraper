The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) will be raising ₹10,000 crore corpus for ‘Stand Up India' fund from the Reserve Bank of India. The fund will be used to refinance the loans extended by the banks to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women entrepreneurs. The 'Stand Up India' scheme was announced by the Centre earlier in January.
