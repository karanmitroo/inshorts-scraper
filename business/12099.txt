Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into companies based out of the National Capital Region (NCR) accounted for over a third of the $29.44 billion overseas investment during the April-December period this fiscal, according to RBI's regional office-wise compilations. Notably, this was twice of what was invested in Mumbai-based firms. NCR accounted for less than a quarter of the FDI during 2014-15.
