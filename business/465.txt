India's third largest telecom operator Idea Cellular on Wednesday said it has suspended interconnect services with Aircel over non-payment of dues "despite several reminders". Suspension of interconnect services means Aircel users won't be able to connect with users on Idea's network. The company didn't specify the amount but said it will restore services after Aircel makes the payment.
