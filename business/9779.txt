The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to file its response to a Federation of Indian Airlines' (FIA) plea over alleged irregularities while granting flying licence to AirAsia. FIA claimed that AirAsia had allegedly not disclosed its brand equity agreement according to which its effective control was with a foreign party, which is against stipulations.
