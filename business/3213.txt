A US court has ordered Indian-American billionaire Vinod Khosla to reopen public access to a beach that he had closed for private use. The court ruled that Co-founder of Sun Microsystems must unlock the California beach's gates following a lawsuit by a not-for-profit organisation. Earlier, Khosla's lawyers demanded $30 million (â‚¹192.5 crore) from government to open the beach to public.
