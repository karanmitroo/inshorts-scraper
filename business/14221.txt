US dollar on Thursday slipped to a two-month low after losing ground against Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. Shanghai shares advanced 2.3%, Japan Nikkei gained 1.15% and South Korea's Kospi surged 1.1%. “The dollar selling...is linked to fading expectations of Fed rate increase and not to a creation of fresh dollar short positions”, said a senior researcher at Gaitame.
