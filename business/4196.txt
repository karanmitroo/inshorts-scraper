Essar group has received approval from all 23 lenders to complete the sale of Essar Oil to Russia's state-owned oil firm Rosneft. The lenders also include LIC, to which the company owes around ₹1,200 crore. LIC had earlier refused to give its approval. The ₹86,000 crore deal, which was signed in October 2016, marks the biggest foreign acquisition in India.
