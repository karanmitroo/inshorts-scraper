State-owned carrier Air India has reduced its aircraft-related loans to ₹14,000 crore now, as against ₹20,000 crore at the end of 2015-16. The airline paid back ₹6,000 crore of its loans recently from the proceeds of sale and lease-back of nine Dreamliner aircraft. A 'sale-and-leaseback' is a transaction, where one sells an asset and leases it back for long-term.
