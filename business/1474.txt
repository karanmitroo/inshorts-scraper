Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani has said India's online retail sector has a threat from physical retail models like Big Bazaar and Easyday. He said China, which people think is the most digital driven country, has 82% and America has 89% physical retail models. He added India also has huge potential for physical retail as online share is very less.
