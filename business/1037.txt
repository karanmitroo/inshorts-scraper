Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday ruled out having a single rate for all commodities under the GST regime. He said the countries which had applied a uniform tax rate were countries whose entire population was above the poverty line. While the question of a single slab in India does not arise, the process of rationalisation would continue, he added.
