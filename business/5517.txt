Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said, "If the firewalls can be broken...hacking will take place anywhere. It is not a ground that hacking takes place only because Aadhaar is there". “The fact that technologies can be breached is no argument to not use Aadhaar,” he added. Congress leaders like P Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal raised questions on Aadhaar’s security.
