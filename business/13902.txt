Honda Motor Company has said that it would stop using air bag inflators manufactured by Japanâ€™s Takata Corp after the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration slapped a $70 million fine on the latter on Tuesday. The top US auto-safety regulator linked eight deaths to the rupture-prone air bags while ordering Takata to stop using ammonium nitrate in safety devices.
