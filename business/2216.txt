NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said it is not the states' business to decide what a tourist should eat and drink. This comes amid growing prohibition on food and alcohol by state governments. "Tourism is essentially civilisational in character...India must focus on cleanliness. It is number one. Number two, it's about seamless experience," he added.
