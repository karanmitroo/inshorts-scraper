The RBI's latest data indicates that ₹14.90 lakh crore or around 97% of the ₹15.44 lakh crore worth of demonetised currency is back into the banking system, according to reports. This suggests around ₹54,000 crore of banned notes didn't return. This figure is against the government's estimate that around ₹3.44 lakh crore of the old notes would not return.
