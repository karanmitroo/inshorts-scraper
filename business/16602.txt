Petrol and diesel prices were Thursday hiked by Rs 1.50 per litre after government raised excise duty on the two fuel to get an additional revenue of about Rs 13,000 crore. There was possibility of reduction in fuel prices this weekend due to fall in international oil prices. However, the reduction has been negated as the government needs more revenue.
