The Coal Ministry has reportedly proposed the exemption of power plants from auctions for acquiring coal. According to the proposal, only players from unregulated sectors (cement, aluminium and fertilisers) should have to participate in the bidding process. The ministry reasoned that market-driven prices in unregulated sectors prevent the passing on of the benefit of low coal prices to consumers.
