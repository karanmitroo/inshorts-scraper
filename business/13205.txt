The United States government has formally filed an environment lawsuit seeking penalties over $20 billion against Volkswagen for cheating on emission tests of nearly 600,000 vehicles. This is the first case filed against the German automaker by the US Justice Department. Volkswagen had admitted in September to using 'cheat' devices in diesel cars to clear emission tests.
