Yahoo Inc on Tuesday announced quarterly reports that showed net earnings more than double to $163 million in Q3 2016 from $76 million in the corresponding period a year ago. This comes amid Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo for $4.83 billion which came under question after Yahoo confirmed a massive data breach in 2014 that affected over 50 crore accounts.
