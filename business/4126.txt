Billionaire investor and world's fourth richest person Warren Buffett said, "If I ever get elected president, I will never claim credit for anything the market does." "Because I don't want to be blamed when it goes the other direction," he added. His statement was in response to Donald Trump tweeting in March about markets gaining $3.2 trillion since election day.
