Glaxo Smith Kline has decided to slash the price of the widely-used fever and pain-relief pill, Crocin Advance by half, to comply with the DPCO 2013. In March, the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration had issued a show-cause notice to GSK for selling the medicine at a price higher. Crocin has not been available in market over the last month.
