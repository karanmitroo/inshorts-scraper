Chinese yuan fell 0.2% to a six-year low against the dollar on Thursday after Donald Trump won the US Presidential Elections. Trump had earlier called China a "grand master" at currency manipulation and threatened tariffs of up to 45% on the country’s imports. This could cut China’s shipments to the US by 25% in the first year, as per estimates.
