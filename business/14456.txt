After nearly five years, German luxury carmaker Mercedes Benz on Friday relaunched its super luxury brand Maybach in India. The company rolled out two models, the Maybach S500 priced at Rs 1.67 crore and S600 will cost Rs 2.60 crore. Maybach will operate as a sub-brand of Mercedes instead of an independent unit as earlier.
