German hardware billionaire Reinhold Würth, known as the 'Screw King', has angered tourists by anchoring his $110 million (₹700 crore) mega-yacht right in front of the Statue of Liberty. The yacht, called Vibrant Curiosity, is 280 feet long and has an elevator and helicopter pad. Although the yacht is parked legally, people complained that it was blocking the statue's view.
