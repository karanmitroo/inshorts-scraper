Spain's flag carrier Iberia Airlines has been fined €25,000 (over ₹18 lakh) for forcing aspiring flight attendants to take pregnancy tests, which was ruled as discrimination. The company claimed the pregnancy tests were conducted on candidates who have passed the selection process so as to "not assign (expectant mothers) a task that puts their pregnancy at risk".
