The possibility of counterfeiting the new ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes is very less, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said on Thursday. This is the first time notes have been indigenously designed in-house with security features, which makes them more secure with less chance of counterfeiting, he stated. Further, over 2 lakh ATMs have already been recalibrated, he added.
