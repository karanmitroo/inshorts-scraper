Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran said Nano has been targetted for no reason, adding, "The only model (in passenger vehicles) that makes money is Indica." He said shutting down or giving Nano a life is not a billion dollar question to the company. Nano incurs just about 4% of the losses that Tata Motors' passenger cars make yearly, he added.
