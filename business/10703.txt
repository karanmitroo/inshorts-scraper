The US Internal Revenue Service has said that Facebook may have understated the value of the intellectual property it sold to its Ireland subsidiary by "billions of dollars", cutting its tax bill 'unfairly'. This comes after the US Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the social networking site. Facebook, however, denied any wrongdoing stating that it "complies with...rules and regulations".
