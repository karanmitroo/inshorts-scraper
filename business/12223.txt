The European Union on Thursday said it will give its 28 member states the option of removing a tax on tampons which feminists had denounced as unfair. This comes after 3 lakh people signed a petition demanding the same. The announcement was made during an EU meeting on proposals for giving member states increased flexibility to reduce value added tax.
