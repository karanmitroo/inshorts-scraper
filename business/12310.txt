The Supreme Court on Friday noted that its interim orders in favour of corporate groups such as Vedanta, Adani and Essar may have blocked thousands of crores that could have been used by the government for public welfare. The court also expressed its inclination to review all such orders ruled in favour of the companies in cases still under processing.
