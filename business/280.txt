PNB fraud accused Nirav Modi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has said that all bank transactions and allegations made by the CBI were completely wrong. When asked about legal strategy, he said, "When there is a chargesheet, there will be a strategy." "Agencies are making all these noises in the media...Nirav will not be found guilty. I'm certain," he added.
