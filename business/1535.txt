Infosys Co-founder Nandan Nilekani and his wife Rohini have committed to donate half of their estimated $1.7 billion wealth to charity by joining 'The Giving Pledge' initiative. The movement was pioneered by Bill Gates with wife Melinda, and Warren Buffett seven years ago. Other Indians who are a part of this initiative are Azim Premji, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, and PNC Menon.
