The Delhi high court on Friday refused to suspend the air operator's permit (AOP) granted to AirAsia for flying in India. The high court order came on a plea filed by the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA), against the decision of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday, to grant the operational permit to AirAsia.
