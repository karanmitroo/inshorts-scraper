Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said that Reliance Jio’s free offer is hitting the sector adversely and has created unfair competition in the market. “There is a problem. Any big thing if given for free or at less price...becomes very difficult to compete with," he said. Notably, Airtel filed a petition against extension of Jio's free services offer.
