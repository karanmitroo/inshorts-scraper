Coffee company Starbucks' CEO Howard Schultz has written to his employees urging them to embrace "respect and dignity" in the face of an "epic, unseemly election" and share "kindness, compassion, empathy, and love". Schultz had earlier endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. The US election will be held on November 8.
