Russia’s largest oil company Rosneft on Wednesday completed a sale of its 19.5% stake to natural resource trader Glencore International and a Qatari sovereign wealth fund for over $11 billion (over ₹74,000 crore). "That is the biggest privatisation deal, the biggest sale and acquisition in the world’s oil and gas sector in 2016,” Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.
