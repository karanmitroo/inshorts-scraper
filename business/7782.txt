Amid the cash crunch following demonetisation, the RBI on Monday said that small borrowers would get an additional 60 days to repay their credit. Borrowers with housing, car, farm, and other loans of up to â‚¹1 crore from banks and finance companies would be eligible for this. Further, this is applicable to loans payable between November 1 and December 31.
