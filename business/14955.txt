The Greek Parliament on Wednesday passed the austerity measures demanded by lenders to begin talks on a new multi-billion-euro bailout package for the country. There were 229 votes in favour of the measures, 64 votes against and six remained absent in the 300-seat chamber. PM Tsipras said that though the package would cause hardship, there was no alternative to it.
