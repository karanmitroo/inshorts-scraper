According to data published on Wednesday, Russia's economy is fast moving towards a recession under the weight of Western sanctions and a sharp decline in the price for oil, its main source of currency. The government expects GDP to shrink by 3% in 2015, the first drop since 2009; while the ruble has halved in value over the past year.
