Malaysian investor Lim Tze Cheng, whose fund has gained 51% in 2017 has said "fund management in boring". "You find, you buy and there's nothing else to do but sit and wait...busy ones are those who try to trade," he added. Lim, who donates half his salary to help the needy, said real excitement is in making money for charity.
