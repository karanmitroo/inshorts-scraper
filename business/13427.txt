RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said the central bank is prepared for any volatility in global financial markets which may be triggered by the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates after its December 15-16 meeting. “The Fed has prepared the ground and we are expecting that it will raise rates anywhere between one and 25 basis points”, he said.
