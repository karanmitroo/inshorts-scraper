Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said foreign direct investment in tobacco sector cannot be encouraged as it would be against Indiaâ€™s commitment to the World Health Organization. Stating it to be a health affecting sector, she said allowing FDI will encourage more cigarette-producing companies. The ministry had earlier proposed a complete ban on FDI in the sector.
