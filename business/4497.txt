Walt Disney’s first map of his planned Disneyland theme park is going up for sale and could fetch up to $900,000 (₹5.78 crore), auctioneers said on Friday. The 1953 map, hand-inked and hand-coloured, was created and presented to investors to secure funding to build the first Disney theme park in Anaheim. The sale will include some 1,000 other Disneyland items.
