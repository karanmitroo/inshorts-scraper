India's third biggest gold fund Reliance Gold Savings Fund will start accepting fresh investments again from Wednesday, after it suspended inflows three months ago to support government's efforts to curb down gold demand and control 'rising trade deficit'. Experts believe that 'drop in gold imports and the current account deficit could have prompted Reliance to reopen'  the fund for business.
