Sahara group Thursday expressed its inability before the Supreme Court to immediately pay Rs 10,000 crore for securing bail of its chief Subrata Roy and two others. SC asked 5,000 crore should be in bank guarantee and rest in cash but the group said that it can pay 2,500 crore immediately and rest 2,500 within three weeks after the release.
