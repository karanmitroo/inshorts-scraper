Beer company Brewdog has faced online backlash over acting like “multinational corporate machines” after forcing a pub to change its name or face action. The brewer, which earlier criticised the way major brewers operate, launched a vodka brand called Lone Wolf. The firm then threatened legal action against a pub with the same name, prompting accusations of 'bullying' and 'hypocrisy'.
