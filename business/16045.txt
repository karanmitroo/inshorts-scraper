The rupee on Thursday slid by 45 paise against the dollar, its worst singe-session drop in nearly seven weeks. The Indian unit ended lower at 61.86 against the greenback on month-end dollar demand from importers and banks. The dollar demand was robust amid speculation that US Fed is considering raising interest rates later this year.
