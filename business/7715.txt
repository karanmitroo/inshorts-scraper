Swiss watchmaker Omega's VP for product, Jean-Claude Monachon while talking about smartwatches being a threat to the industry, said, "I could imagine smartwatch as an accessory in a bracelet, but not as a replacement for mechanical watch. It has no soul." He added, "The technology becomes obsolete." Swiss watch demand saw the biggest drop in seven years in October 2016.
