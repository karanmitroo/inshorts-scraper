Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said that results of Bihar Assembly polls will not have any impact on the process of economic reforms. "I don't see it as a setback to the economy. If under Nitish Kumar, Bihar grows and grows well, we have already announced economic package for the state, certainly we are going to help," Jaitley said.
