United Airlines will not be fined for forcibly dragging a passenger off an overbooked plane in April. The US government said there was no evidence that the airline discriminated against Asian-American passenger David Dao on the basis of race, and violated his civil rights. However, it said United didn't comply with all aspects of the government's rules on overselling seats.
