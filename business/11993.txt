According to reports, United States drug maker Pfizer has decided to terminate its deal to acquire fellow company Allergan. The deal, which was worth $160 billion, was reportedly abandoned after the Obama administration earlier announced new rules to discourage such deals. The deal would have enabled Pfizer to save on taxes by acquiring Allergan, which is based in Ireland.
