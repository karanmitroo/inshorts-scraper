Vijay Mallya failed to make a personal appearance before the Supreme Court on July 10, despite being directed to do so. SC had earlier held Mallya, who is currently in UK, guilty of contempt of court over failure to furnish details of his Indian and offshore assets. It had directed Mallya to appear to argue on the quantum of punishment.
