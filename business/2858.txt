A petition has been filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the allotment of 4,500 acres of land to Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Yog Sansthan for setting up a food park in Noida. The petitioner has alleged that the proposed project would involve felling of nearly 6,000 trees which would result in huge damage to the environment.
