The 18-day stir by jewellers which ended on Saturday is estimated to have caused losses of â‚¹60,000-70,000 crore to the jewellery industry, the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) said. The jewellers had protested against the proposed 1% excise duty of non-silver jewellery. Meanwhile, a three-member committee has been set up by the government to look into the issue.
