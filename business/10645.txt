Housing finance major HDFC on Thursday raised ₹3,000 crore in the first ever issue of ‘masala bonds’, which got oversubscribed by 4.3 times. The bonds will be listed on the London Stock Exchange and cannot be traded in the local Indian market. ‘Masala bonds’ are rupee-denominated bonds through which Indian entities can raise funds by accessing overseas capital markets.
