The cryptocurrency market has lost over $100 billion in market capitalisation in less than 24 hours. From an all-time high of $835.5 billion on January 7, the market valuation of all cryptocurrencies now stands at $390 billion. All major cryptocurrencies fell about 15-30% after India's Finance Ministry announced the country wants to "eliminate" the use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities.
