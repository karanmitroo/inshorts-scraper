The Bank of England's chief economist Andrew Haldane has admitted to errors in estimating the impact of the Brexit vote. The bank had predicted a dramatic slowdown in growth if the country voted to leave the EU. However, UK's economy maintained 0.6% growth in the April-June and July-September quarters, suggesting that the economy did not slow down after Brexit referendum.
