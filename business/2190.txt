Retired SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has said the last year of her job was the most eventful because of demonetisation, merger with associate banks, and GST. She said, "We had to make rules as we went along and had to lay out the roadway as we progressed." Bhattacharya added that her one regret was not seeing the end of NPAs.
