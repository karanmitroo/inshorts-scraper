The US has told India that it is bound by legislation on the recent visa fee hike, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Saturday. Last year, the US had imposed a special fee of up to $4,500 on H-1B and L-1 visas that are popular among Indian IT companies. H-1B and L-1 visas allow US companies to recruit foreign professionals.
