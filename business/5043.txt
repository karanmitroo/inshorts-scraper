Airbus CEO Tom Enders is being investigated for suspected fraud in connection with a $2 billion Eurofighter jet order by Austria over a decade ago. Prosecutors opened criminal investigation two months ago, which for the first time named Airbus as a defendant. Notably, prosecutors have been investigating for years whether officials received bribes to chose Eurofighter jets over rival offers.
