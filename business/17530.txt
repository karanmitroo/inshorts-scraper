Cadbury India, a household name for over six decades now, will soon be rechristened Mondelez India, after its US-based parent company Mondelez International. While the name Mondelez does not have a great recall among Indian consumers, Cadbury India MD Manu Anand believes that wouldn't clash with the popularity of its household brands such as Dairy Milk, 5-Star and Gems.
