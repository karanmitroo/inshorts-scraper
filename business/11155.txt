The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has said it has received approval from the RBI to start an online bidding platform for the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme. Under the initiative, gold-denominated bonds are issued by the government as an alternative to physical holding of gold. The mock bidding session in this regard has been started from Friday, BSE said.
