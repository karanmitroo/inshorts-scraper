RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said the panic over Britain's exit from the European Union is exaggerated, adding, it will not impact the rupee as much as feared. "The rupee movement today is moderate compared with other markets," he added. Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said the markets are reacting spontaneously and will stabilise in a few days.
