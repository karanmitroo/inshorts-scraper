A preventive dengue vaccine may be available in the Indian market as French pharmaceuticals firm Sanofi is planning to bring six innovative drugs. These drugs will also include Praluent, an injectable medicine that cuts cholesterol and Toujeo, a long-acting insulin to treat diabetes. Notably, Delhi in 2015 saw over 10,000 reported dengue cases, the highest since 1996.
