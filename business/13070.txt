According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the Finance Ministry is considering setting up a ‘bad bank’, which would absorb non-performing assets (NPAs) of state-run lenders. A 'bad bank' holds bad or stressed assets until repayment is done by the borrowers, or till those assets are sold to other investors. By transferring these assets, banks clear their balance sheets.
