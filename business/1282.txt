Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe has said that the fascination with virtual currencies including Bitcoin is more like a "speculative mania". Bitcoin seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions, he added. Bitcoin's price surged past the $17,000 mark last week.
