Rubik's Cube, a three-dimensional puzzle, lost a trademark battle on Thursday after a European court said its shape was not sufficient to grant protection against those who copy it. UK-based Seven Towers, which manages Rubik's Cube intellectual property rights, registered its shape as an EU trademark in 1999. However, German toy maker Simba Toys challenged the trademark protection in 2006.
