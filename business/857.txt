The government will invite fresh applications for the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Deputy Governor post although interviews were conducted last year, according to reports. The position remained vacant after SS Mundra retired after his three-year term on July 31, 2017. Notably, the RBI has four Deputy Governorsâ€“ two from within the organisation, an economist, and a commercial banker.
