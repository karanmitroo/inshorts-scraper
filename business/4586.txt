British Airways said it would take steps to ensure there was no repeat of a computer system failure that stranded 75,000 passengers over the weekend. "[W]e will carry out an exhaustive investigation...and take measures to ensure it never happens again," it said. Notably, BA is expected to face a bill exceeding £100 million (₹830 crore) due to the outage.
