Market regulator Sebi on Wednesday complained to the Supreme Court that two Sahara companies had failed to hand over original title deeds of assets worth Rs 20,000 crore. Last month the apex court had asked Sahara to deposit the title deeds of its assets, as two group companies had failed to refund Rs 20,000 crore to its investors through Sebi.
