Reacting to reports of 97% demonetised currency notes having been returned to the banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday said that such estimates may not be correct. "We are trying to expeditiously complete the counting process and will release figures of notes tendered after that," said RBI in a statement.
