SBI Cards will soon launch a credit card with a ₹25,000 limit for the lower strata of the society, Chief Executive Officer Vijay Jasuja said. The problem is not that these people don’t have money to spend, but that they don’t have cards to use, Jasuja stated. SBI Cards will offer them secured cards in about two-three months, he added.
