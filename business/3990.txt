German carmaker Volkswagen has said it would resume exports to Iran by next month, marking its return after a 17-year absence. The aim is to reduce the carmaker's dependence on volatile markets such as China and Brazil with deliveries to China reportedly dropping 3.3% in 2017. Volkswagen suspended exports to Iran in 2000 over international sanctions against its nuclear weapons.
