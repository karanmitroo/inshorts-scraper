Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman has denied reports that she could be the next Uber CEO. "Speculation about my future and Uber has become a distraction...So let me make this as clear as I can...I plan to remain the company's CEO," she tweeted. She was touted as Uber's potential CEO after she stepped down from HP's board on Wednesday.
