Infosys Co-founder and former Unique Identification Authority of India chairman Nandan Nilekani has backed the government's decision to demonetise the ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, saying it was needed to speed up the move to a cashless economy. “There is no question that this is a very bold move—and it’s a defining point in India moving to cashless,” he added.
