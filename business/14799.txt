China’s producer prices fell to nearly a six-year low in July on a subdued consumer inflation. The National Statistics Bureau on Sunday reported that the country’s Producer Price Index (PPI) fell by 5.4% from a year earlier, against the predicted 5% decline. This was reportedly the worst reading since October 2009 and the 40th consecutive month of price falls.
