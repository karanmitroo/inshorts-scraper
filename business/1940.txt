A Rolex Daytona wristwatch once owned by late actor Paul Newman has fetched $17.8 million (nearly â‚¹116 crore) at an auction, making it the most expensive wristwatch ever auctioned. Sold for 17 times more than what was expected, the 1968 wristwatch was a gift from Newman's wife. In 1984, he gifted the watch to his daughter's then-boyfriend, who auctioned it.
