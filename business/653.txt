A certain portion of India's Union Budget was leaked in 1950 when the printing used to take place at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Later, the venue was moved to a government press on Minto Road in Delhi after the leak. The North Block basement at the capital's Secretariat Building has become the permanent place for printing Budget papers since 1980.
