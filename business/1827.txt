US' third and fourth-largest wireless carriers, T-Mobile and Sprint, have officially called off their merger talks claiming they were "unable to find mutually agreeable terms". This is the second time their merger talks have failed. The chief executives of both the companies said they still see the benefits of combining but indicated the talks ended over financial terms.
