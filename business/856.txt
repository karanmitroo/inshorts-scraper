The European Union (EU) is considering a proposal to remove eight jurisdictions including Panama, the UAE, and South Korea from the 17-member tax haven blacklist it adopted last month. The eight jurisdictions could be moved to the 'grey list' which includes nations that have committed to change rules on tax transparency and cooperation. Currently, the 'grey list' includes 47 jurisdictions.
