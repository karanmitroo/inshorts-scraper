Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej has said that people expressing concerns over GST and calling for postponement of its implementation are mainly tax evaders. He further termed suggestions about GST roll out being pushed to October as "ridiculous". "Everybody has plenty of time to prepare...I saw the statement by P Chidambaram...But I think it will be ridiculous," Godrej stated.
