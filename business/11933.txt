Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said he would soon file 16 cases against the US for giving protection to solar panel producers in violation of World Trade Organization norms. Earlier, in February, the US had won a WTO ruling against India after challenging the rules on the origin of solar cells and modules used in India's solar power programme.
