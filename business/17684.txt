Microsoft has reportedly decided to waive off license fees of Windows phone OS for the Indian phone makers - Lava and Karbonn - and is offering it to them for free. Both the companies are rumoured to be releasing their Windows phone in the next couple of months. Interestingly, Microsoft had initially denied giving the OS to Nokia for free.
