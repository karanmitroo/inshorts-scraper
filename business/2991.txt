Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan, while backing Co-founder Narayana Murthy, denounced performance of board for having "let down investors". He said Chairman R Seshasayee and Co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan should step down. Adding that no CEO would join if acrimony between founders and board continues, he said the audit committee and nominations committee chairpersons should also take responsibility.
