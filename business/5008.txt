The local pilots' body of Jet Airways has deferred its decision to not fly with foreign pilots from next month. The body had earlier issued a directive to its members not to fly with expatriate commanders after one of the foreign pilots allegedly assaulted a trainer. It had also alleged that Jet Airways treats Indian pilots in "step motherly" manner.
