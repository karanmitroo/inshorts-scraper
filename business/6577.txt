India's largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Wednesday said that predatory pricing by new entrants is hurting the Indian telecom industry. Further, the company said that free offers by telecom companies would hit all stakeholders, including lenders and government revenue. Notably, the sector is facing an escalating price war since Reliance Jio began commercial services in September.
