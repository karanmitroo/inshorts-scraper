Reliance General Insurance has released a series of digital ads featuring only dogs for its Car Insurance Campaign. Inspired by the amazing popularity of cute animal videos on the internet, the digital films aim to break the clutter in a rather uni-dimensional category like insurance. The films drive home the messages of free roadside assistance by putting dogs in different scenarios.
