Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son on Friday said, "It's actually sad to be rich...My net worth was growing at $10 million a day before the ‘dot com bubble’ burst and I started asking myself, 'What is money?'" The SoftBank Founder admitted he "started feeling the value of money again" after losing 99% of his wealth in the 'dot com bubble' burst.
