The Indian Exchequer incurred a ₹36.69 crore loss in 2014 when the Bank Note Press did not use Governor Raghuram Rajan's signature on the newly printed currency notes, according to reports. The press continued printing ₹20, ₹100 and ₹500 denomination notes with the previous RBI Governor D Subbarao's signature for nearly two months after his term had already ended.
