The Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India on why depositing old notes is not allowed till March 31. During demonetisation, RBI had said old notes can be exchanged till March 31, 2017. However, RBI is only allowing NRIs and those who were abroad during demonetisation period to deposit old notes.
