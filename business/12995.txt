Amid growing concerns about China's economic growth rate, the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, said on Tuesday it would inject over $91.22 billion into the money markets. This comes after China reported its weakest economic growth in 25 years for 2015. Further, the central bank also injected $8.36 billion into its banking system on Monday.
