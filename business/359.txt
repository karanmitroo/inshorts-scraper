The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Communications Director, Gerry Rice, has said that the tax collection assumptions in India's 2018-19 Budget are ambitious. "It assumes that the government would be able to climb higher tax revenue from the same amount of consumption and income," Rice added. However, he further said that IMF welcomes the budget targets and is supportive of them.
