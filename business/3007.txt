Coal India is in a deadlock with its workers' union over this year's salary hike. The union had earlier demanded a 50% hike, which was later brought down to 21%. However, the firm said such a large hike was not possible and that it could only manage about 15%. Reportedly, Coal India spent about â‚¹33,000 crore on salaries in 2016-17.
