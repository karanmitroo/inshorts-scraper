RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that the Indian government wasn't done with rate cuts this year and would closely monitor data coming in to 'take a further view'. The RBI kept the repo rate on hold in its latest policy review after cutting it by 0.75% this year, to ensure banks pass on the lower rates to consumers.
