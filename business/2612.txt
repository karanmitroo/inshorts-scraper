Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava said that although the company supports the government's intent to end automobiles driven by fossil fuels, it can't force customers to buy electric vehicles. “Unless the EV is good for the customer, I can’t push him to buy it,” Bhargava said. "Gadkari and the government are not going to kill this industry," he further noted.
