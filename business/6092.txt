RBI Governor Urjit Patel said that over the last few months, not just the central bank, but the wider banking system has done a "Herculean job" in managing challenges. Patel said remonetisation was done at a "very quick" pace and RBI has managed to normalise the situation. The benefits of demonetisation will take time to fully play out, Patel added.
