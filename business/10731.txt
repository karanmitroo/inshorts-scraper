Mahindra & Mahindra's Executive Director Pawan Goenka on Wednesday said that the automobile major's two-wheeler segment "has not met expectations last year" and the firm has 'right-sized' itself by giving voluntary retirement to 250 employeesâ€‹. However, Goenka added that it is "unlikely" that Mahindra will exit the segment. Notably, Mahindra's two-wheeler sales in 2015-16 had dropped by 12.7%.
