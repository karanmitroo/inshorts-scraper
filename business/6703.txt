A man mistakenly received ₹70,000 instead of ₹3,500 from a Bank of Baroda ATM in Rajasthan's Tonk town on Tuesday. Around 10 people are believed to have received extra cash from the ATM, which an official said, was malfunctioning after ₹2,000 notes were stored in ₹100 notes slot. The ATM dispensed ₹6.76 lakh cash before it was shut down.
