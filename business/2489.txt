Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said that fuel prices may come down by Diwali, which falls next month. He said the prices of refinery oil went up because the production of oil dropped by 13% in the US due to floods. When asked about bringing oil under GST, Pradhan said, "It will extend enormous benefit to customers."
