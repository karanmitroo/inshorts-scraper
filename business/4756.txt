Shilpa Shetty and her husband Raj Kundra have slapped a defamation notice of ₹100 crore on businessman Ravi Mohanlal Bhalotia. The textile firm owner earlier accused the couple of cheating him of almost ₹24 lakh by selling his firm's bedsheets but not paying him his dues. A quashing petition against Bhalotia's case has been filed in the Bombay High Court.
