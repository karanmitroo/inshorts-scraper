A 3-foot-long rabbit named Simon, which was expected to become the world's biggest rabbit, died in the cargo section of a United Airlines flight recently travelling from London to Chicago. "Something very strange has happened...I've sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before," stated Simon's breeder. The airlines stated that it is reviewing the incident.
