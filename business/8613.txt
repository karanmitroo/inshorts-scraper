Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has reconfirmed that it will not charge for voice calls made on its network. Zero-tariff on voice calls is not part of any promotional package and won't be affected by withdrawal of such packages, Jio stated. Earlier, a TRAI official observed that free voice calls are not among Jio's tariff plans approved by the telecom regulator.
