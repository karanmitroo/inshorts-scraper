The Supreme Court on Friday refused to extend Subrata Roy's parole and directed that the Sahara Group chief along with two others be sent back to jail. Sahara's lawyer had demanded a later hearing as the company couldn't arrange â‚¹300 crore for extension of his interim bail. Roy has been on parole since May, granted to him on humanitarian grounds.
