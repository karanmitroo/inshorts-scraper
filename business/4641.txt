A US court has issued an arrest warrant for Bikram Choudhury, the Indian-American "hot yoga" guru who was ordered to pay $7 million over a sexual harassment case in 2016. The millionaire founder of a global fitness business has not paid the amount and claimed he was nearly bankrupt. Authorities believe he hid his assets and left the country.
