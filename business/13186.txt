According to credit rating agency ICRA, the proposed extension of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to kerosene, if implemented nationally, could save 30-40% annually on under-recoveries. Falling crude prices are likely to further bring down under-recovery on kerosene by 50% to ₹12,500 crore in 2015-16, ICRA added. Under-recovery is the notional loss incurred by a firm on a subsidised product’s price.
