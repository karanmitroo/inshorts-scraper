Financial services organisation HSBC on Monday projected a 7.4% GDP growth for India for the financial year ending March 31, 2016. The growth for the next financial year will also remain at the same level, the bank said. Reforms like the introduction of GST and Bankruptcy code will "continue to be the main drivers of higher potential growth", HSBC added.
