NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar has said financial resources won't be a constraint for the "game-changing" healthcare scheme introduced in the Budget. The government announced it would provide health insurance cover of ₹5 lakh to 10 crore poor families. Kumar added that the proposed 1% additional cess will yield ₹11,000 crore annually, which is enough to meet funding needs.
