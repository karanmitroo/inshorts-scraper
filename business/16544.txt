The capital market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Thursday withdrew the recognition granted to Delhi Stock Exchange, after finding some "serious irregularities" in its functioning. "It is seen that the present management, even after getting to know about the irregularities committed by the erstwhile management, has not initiated any action," Sebi said.
