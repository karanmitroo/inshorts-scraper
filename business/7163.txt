Telecom major Airtel has moved the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal against telecom regulator TRAI for allowing Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio to continue its free promotional offer beyond the stipulated 90 days. Airtel charged the regulator of being a “mute spectator” to violations, which have caused “significant prejudice and day-to-day loss” to it and affected its traffic.
