International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde on Friday said the global economic body is “quite bullish about India”, while forecasting 7.5% growth for the 2016-17 fiscal. She further called India “one of the major beneficiaries of the lower oil prices” and also expressed her “hope” for the passage of “critically important” reforms like the GST and Land Acquisition bills.
