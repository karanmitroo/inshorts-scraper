The world’s largest education publisher Pearson has reported a pre-tax loss of nearly $3.3 billion (₹22,000 crore) for 2016, the biggest in its history. The publisher in January saw almost $2.5 billion (around ₹17,000 crore) wiped from its market value after issuing its fifth profit warning in two years. The loss comes after a slump in its US education operations.
