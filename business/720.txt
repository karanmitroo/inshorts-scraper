UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin must be regulated to prevent them from being used for criminal activity. She added, "It (Bitcoin) is something that has been increasingly developing. I think it's something that we do need to look at." Her Chancellor Philip Hammond said cryptocurrencies need to be regulated before they destabilise the global economy.
