Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the government has "full confidence" in Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, after BJP MP Subramanian Swamy demanded his removal for his purported 'anti-India stance'. "His (CEA's) advice is of great value," Jaitley added. Further, the BJP said the party "does not agree" with Swamy’s views and stated that this is "his personal opinion”.
