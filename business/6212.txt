UK's largest supermarket Tesco ripped off its customers by offering multi-buy deals months after they were no longer valid, an investigation revealed. The retailer's stores were still advertising expired offers, which were not applied at checkout. The investigation further found that even after the issue was pointed out to the staff, some stores didn't remove the misleading labels from shelves.
