The government on Monday proposed to impose a retirement tax on Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) at the time of final withdrawal, on 60% of the contributions made after April 1, 2016. Currently, the deposits, interest accrued and withdrawals under EPF are tax-exempt. However, Public Provident Fund (PPF) contributions will remain tax exempt, and no tax will be levied on withdrawal.
