PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said some people who are spreading rumours that political parties enjoy concessions and exemptions "are wrong". "The law applies equally to all. Whether it is an individual, an organisation, or a political party, everyone has to abide by law," he stated. People who cannot endorse corruption openly resort to searching for government's faults, Modi added.
