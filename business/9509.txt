India’s trade deficit fell by 38% in August to $7.7 billion, from $12.4 billion in the same month last year, government data revealed on Thursday. India’s exports for August dropped by 0.3% year-on-year to $21.5 billion, while imports contracted 14.09% to $29.2 billion. A larger trade deficit indicates that large amounts of Indian rupees are being held by foreign nations.
