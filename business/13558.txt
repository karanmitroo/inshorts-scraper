The Delhi High Court held Micromax guilty of contempt of its November 2014 order which restrained it from violating Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson's patents. Micromax had been sued by Ericsson in 2014 for using its patents in manufacturing without any payment. However, it was later found out that a Micromax subsidiary continued to manufacture phones again without any payment.
