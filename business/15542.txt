Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that India's ability to withstand global economic shocks was strong, owing to the "vast depth and size" of the country's market. "Even in the past, when international trends have been far more volatile, our dependence on our own domestic markets has made us relatively more stable than ever," he added.
