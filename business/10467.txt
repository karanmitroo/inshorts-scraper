The United Forum of Bank Unions, an umbrella organisation of nine bank employee unions representing 8 lakh staffers, went on a one-day strike on Friday. Services at around 80,000 bank branches across the country have been affected. The strike comes in protest against the proposed merger of SBI associates with the parent besides other issues.
