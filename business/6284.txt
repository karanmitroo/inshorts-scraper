Air India has taken its operations department head off flying duties for skipping the mandatory pre-flight medical test. The order comes after the airline requested DGCA to investigate Captain AK Kathpalia for endangering passengers' safety. Notably, crew members who test positive for alcohol test or refuse to take a breath-analyser test must be taken off flying duty for four weeks.
