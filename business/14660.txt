The preliminary Caixin China Manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest levels in six-and-a-half-years to 47.1 in August, Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit said on Friday. The reading was worse than July's 47.8, which was a two-year low in itself. Asian stocks tumbled further after the news broke, extending the worst week for global equities in nine months.
