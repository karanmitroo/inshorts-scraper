The Central Board of Direct Taxes on Tuesday asked the I-T department to ensure that there is no "threat, warning or show cause notice" to taxpayers contacted by it under 'Operation Clean Money'. It further mandated no person under verification as part of the operation is required to attend the I-T office "personally under any circumstance and at any stage".
