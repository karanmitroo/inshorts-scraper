Business conglomerate Shapoorji Pallonji Group has termed the removal of Cyrus Mistry from the post of Chairman of Tata Sons as "illegal", stating that a 15-day notice was required before replacing Mistry. The group is going to challenge the decision, according to reports. Notably, Tata Sons on Monday appointed Ratan Tata as its Interim Chairman, replacing Mistry.
