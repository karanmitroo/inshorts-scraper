Amid the hearing on Hindustan Unileverâ€™s plea against Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, the Bombay High Court suggested changes that could be made to Amul ice-cream ads in order to reach a compromise. It suggested that Amul ice-cream makers change the wording in their ad's voiceover. Notably, HUL sued GCMMF over its advertisements, saying these harmed its Kwality Wall's brand.
