Fast-food giant Burger King used horror movie 'IT' to troll its rival McDonald's at the film's premiere in Germany. Burger King's message before the movie's final credit reads, "The moral is: never trust a clown," followed by the second message that reads, "Burger King". The reference is to Ronald McDonald, the clown used as a mascot for the McDonald's brand.
