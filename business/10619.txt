China's GDP registered a 6.7% year-on-year growth in the second quarter (April-June), unchanged from the previous three-month period. The latest quarterly growth figure is slightly more than the expected 6.6% growth, according to Reuters. However, the investment in fixed assets, which includes both infrastructure and manufacturing, grew at 9% in the first six months - the slowest since 2000.
