China’s holdings of US Treasuries declined to the lowest level since 2012, as the world’s second-largest economy runs down its reserves to support the yuan. China, the biggest foreign holder of US government debt, had $1.16 trillion in bonds, notes, and bills in September, down $28.1 billion from the prior month. Japan's holdings also fell $7.6 billion to $1.14 trillion.
