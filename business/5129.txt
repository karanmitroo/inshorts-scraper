Former Infosys CFO Rajiv Bansal has invoked the arbitration clause in his severance contract asking for the rest of his allotted payout, according to reports. When Bansal was leaving the firm in 2015, Infosys agreed to pay him ₹17.38 crore, but disbursed only ₹5 crore and halted the remaining payment. This comes amid Infosys Co-founders raising concerns over executives' pay.
