SEBI's mutual fund advisory panel has reportedly recommended strict definitions for mutual fund schemes, that might halve the number of schemes offered currently. SEBI aims to ensure that an asset management company has only one product offering in each category. The move is expected to help investors cut through the clutter of 2,000 investment schemes, and take better decisions.
