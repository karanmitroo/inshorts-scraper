Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday warned that demonetisation and "hasty" implementation of GST are bound to impact GDP growth adversely. He said both the moves have impacted informal and small scale sectors, which account for about 40% of India's $2.5 trillion economy. He further said that 90% of India's employment is in the informal sector.
