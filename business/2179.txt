The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday lowered India's growth projection to 6.7% in 2017, 0.5 percentage points less than its previous two forecasts in April and July. The cut has been attributed to demonetisation and GST rollout. However, it said the structural reforms undertaken by the government are expected to help push growth above 8% in the medium term.
