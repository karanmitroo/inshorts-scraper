The government may replace the existing Five-year plan system with a medium-term fiscal framework that will project fiscal allocations for the next three years beginning 2017-18, Niti Aayog Vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya said. This comes in the backdrop of the 12th Plan period ending in 2016-17. The last two years of the current plan will be used as transition, he added.
