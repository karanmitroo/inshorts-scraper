Fake news about Wipro Chairman Azim Premji investing $515 million in a technology startup called 'RevFeed' has gone viral. The news was originally published on a fake website that looked like CNN Money but had the URL 'cnm.today' to lure subscribers to RevFeed. Though the startup has denied publishing the false articles, visiting the URL redirects to RevFeed's own website.
