India’s largest lender SBI has cut deposit rates by 25 basis points in some maturities, thereby indicating excess liquidity in the banking system. SBI has cut rates for deposits less than ₹1 crore with a maturity period of 455 days to 3 years, starting this month. SBI’s deposit rate cut will push other PSU banks to cut rates, analysts said.
