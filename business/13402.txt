Rising for the third consecutive day, the BSE Sensex on Wednesday climbed 173.93 points to close at 25,494.37 while the NSE Nifty gained 50.00 points to settle at 7,750.90. Analysts attributed the gains to buying of blue chip stocks ahead of the US Federal Reserveâ€™s rate-hike decision. Several automobile stocks declined following a Supreme Court ruling against diesel vehicles.
