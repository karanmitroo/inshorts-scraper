The government on Wednesday announced that Aadhaar number is not compulsory to register a new business. Kalraj Mishra, MSME Minister said, “There were reports that Aadhaar number was mandatory for registration of new businesses. Today I want to clarify that Aadhaar number is not mandatory.” A single-page registration form called Udyog Aadhaar was also launched for MSMEs in September.
