Six new airlines would fly the Indian skies next year, Minister of state for civil aviation Mahesh Sharma said on Tuesday. The minister, however, did not name the air carriers. It may be noted that AirAsia started its India operations in 2014, while Vistara, the Tata-SIA joint venture carrier, would start flights from January 9.
