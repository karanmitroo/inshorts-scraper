Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reportedly planning about 5,000 job cuts as a part of an effort to combat increasing competition and higher component prices. The job cuts at the company are likely to affect workers in the US and abroad, including managers. The reduction of about 10% of company's workforce of around 50,000 is expected to start before year end.
