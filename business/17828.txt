Smarting from growing losses, Taiwanese phone maker HTC Corp is all set to make cheaper smartphones in order to return to profit. The company will sell products in the $150- $300 (Rs 9,000- 19,000) price range for both emerging and developed markets along with its accustomed high-end phones which can sell for over $600 (Rs 38,000 approximately).
