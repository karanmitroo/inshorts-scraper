The Chairman of RPG Group, which owns CEAT Tyres and Zensar Technologies, Harsh Goenka said, "Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata". He added, "This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better". Tata Group companies have lost about $7 billion in market value over Mistry's removal.
