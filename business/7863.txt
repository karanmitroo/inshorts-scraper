The government has clarified that implementation cost of demonetisation will not be more than the benefits, stating this was just a myth. The parallel economy "corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country's economy" adversely affecting poor and middle classes more than others, it added. The statement was part of a series of 'Myth vs Reality' tweets on demonetisation.
