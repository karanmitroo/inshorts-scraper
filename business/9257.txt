Former IMF Chief economist Ken Rogoff has said China's economic slowdown is more than what the official figures show, and it is the biggest threat to the global economy. Earlier, a global think-tank said that China's credit-to-GDP gap stood at 30.1%. Reportedly, China's debt grew by 15.7% last year, and it has soared to about 250% of its GDP.
