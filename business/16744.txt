In the Rs.3k crore tax dispute case between Vodafone India and Indian tax authorities, the Bombay HC ruled in favour of Vodafone on Friday. The court said, Vodafone was not liable to pay further transfer pricing tax that the taxman had imposed. The taxman sought to get tax from Vodafone India, which it said had received fund from the UK-based parent.
