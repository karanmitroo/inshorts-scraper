The five-day long festive season sale, which ended on Thursday, saw the combined sales of e-commerce firms clock an amount worth around â‚¹6,500 crore, up 20% from that in a similar sale period last year. A total of nearly 350-400 lakh units across categories were sold during the sale. E-commerce firms will reportedly launch another such sale before Diwali.
