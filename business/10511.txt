The International Tribunal in The Hague has ruled against the Indian government in a 2015 case filed by Devas Multimedia for cancellation of a deal by Antrix, the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation. India could reportedly have to pay nearly $1 billion in damages. The deal, involving leasing of spectrum from two satellites, was terminated in 2011.
