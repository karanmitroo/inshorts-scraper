The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said the price of a crude basket produced by its 13 members fell to $25 per barrel on Thursday. The falling price comes in the wake of Iran expecting UN nuclear watchdog to lift its sanctions which crippled its oil exports and the US lifting its decades-old ban on its oil exports.
