Blockchain startup Tezos' Founders Kathleen and Arthur Breitman have been sued in a class action lawsuit for defrauding participants and violating the US securities law. The lawsuit alleges that the Founders sold unregistered securities and seeks a refund and damages for the plaintiffs. Tezos raised $232 million in one of the largest Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), earlier in July.
