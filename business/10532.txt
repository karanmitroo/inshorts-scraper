Internet giant Yahoo was once worth $125 billion at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Yahoo began in 1994 as “Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web,” a directory of websites. Notably, Yahoo's core internet business has been acquired by American telecommunications company, Verizon on Monday for $4.83 billion.
