A report by UK's Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has said India will overtake France and UK to become world's fifth-largest economy in 2018. CEBR Deputy Chairman Douglas McWilliams said despite temporary setbacks caused by demonetisation and GST, India will leapfrog both countries. China is likely to overtake the US as world's largest economy in 2032, CEBR added.
