Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram criticised the bullet train project saying that bullet train is not for ordinary people but an "ego trip for the high and mighty". He added that the railways should rather spend on safety, better infrastructure and not on bullet trains. This comes a day after a stampede at Mumbai's Elphinstone Railway Station claimed 22 lives.
