Estates of former financier and fraudster Bernard Madoff’s dead sons have reached an agreement with US government to hand over $23 million (₹148 crore) to victims of his Ponzi scheme. This resolves an eight-year legal battle over fortunes they amassed at Madoff's bogus securities firm. Their estates were sued for misusing $150 million of client money on their lavish lifestyles.
