After its big discounted sale day last October, e-commerce giant Flipkart has started preparing for another 'Big Billion Day' at the end of this year. "Big Billion Day this year will be many times bigger. We also want to see our mobile platform play a larger role in serving customers during this years' sale," said CEO Sachin Bansal.
