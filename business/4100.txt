NITI Aayog member Bibek Debroy has rejected the claim that GST would increase GDP growth rate by 1.5%, stating it as "total rubbish". "Such speculations are based on the assessment of the 13th Finance Commission, which gave that figure for an ideal GST. We are nowhere near an ideal GST," Debroy said. He termed multiple rates as GST's biggest problem.
