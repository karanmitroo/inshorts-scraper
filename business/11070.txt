IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday asked the Indian software exporters not to get "perturbed" by the recent visa issue over sending professionals to the US, saying the American companies cannot "survive" without their help. Further, the issue of massively hiking the Visa fee has been raised by PM Narendra Modi during his recently-concluded US visit, he added.
