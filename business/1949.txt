Indian-American billionaire John Kapoor was arrested on Thursday for bribing doctors in the US to prescribe his firm's opioid painkiller to patients who did not need it. The Amritsar-born entrepreneur is currently on the board of the pharmaceutical company Insys Therapeutics, which he founded. The indictment also alleges that Kapoor and six former executives conspired to defraud health insurers.
