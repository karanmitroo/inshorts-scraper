In a series of tweets on Sunday, US President-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose a 35% tax on products sold inside the US by businesses that moved to another country. The companies should be "forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake," he added. Reports said Trump could face a legal challenge if the tax was imposed without congressional approval.
