The RBI has kept the repo rate, the rate at which banks borrow from RBI, unchanged at 6% during its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy review on Wednesday. The status quo comes after retail inflation hit a 5-month high of 3.36% in August. In the last review policy in August, RBI reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6%.
