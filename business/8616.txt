The dollar surged to its highest level in over eight months on Friday, amid higher expectations of a US Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year and a weakening euro. This came after Microsoft shares touched an all-time high, while Time Warner's shares also hit their highest in 15 years. Notably, euro fell to a seven-month low versus the dollar.
