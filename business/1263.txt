Real-estate firm Jaypee Associates has deposited ₹150 crore in the Supreme Court registry after it was ordered to deposit the amount by December 14. The court said its "indulgence" in allowing the group to pay ₹2,000 crore in instalments is aimed at protecting the interest of homebuyers. The SC also refused to grant more time to deposit another ₹125 crore.
