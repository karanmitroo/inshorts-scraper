The Ministry of Finance on Thursday clarified that it is not considering any proposal to withdraw cheque book facility for banks. Earlier this week, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said the government might make such a move to encourage digital transactions. Currently, over 95% transactions happen via cash and cheques, according to reports.
