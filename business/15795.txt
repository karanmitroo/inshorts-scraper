India's largest private-sector crude oil producer, Cairn India said on Wednesday it would cut spending by about 60% for the fiscal year starting April 1, as falling crude oil prices hurt profitability and made project expansions unviable. Cairn is revising capital expenditure for 2015-16 to $500 million from $1.2 billion, and will only undertake projects viable at current oil prices.
