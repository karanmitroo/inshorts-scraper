Israel's central bank's Deputy Governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg has said cryptocurrencies "should be viewed as a financial asset". "There is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to...monitor the risks inherent in such activity," she added. She further said that there are compliance risks to the bank beyond the risks to the customer.
