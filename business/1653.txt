A jury has awarded $7.5 million (â‚¹49 crore) to a customer who broke his hip in 2015 while picking up a watermelon at a Walmart store in the US state of Alabama. The customer's foot got stuck after he stepped on a wooden pallet to get the fruit. His lawyer argued that the retail giant should have covered the pallet.
