Two former Wells Fargo employees have filed a class action against the company, seeking over $2.6 billion for workers. The lawsuit is on behalf of Wells Fargo's employees over the last 10 years, who tried to meet sales quotas without engaging in fraud and were demoted or fired. Wells Fargo has fired 5,300 employees for opening 2 million unauthorised accounts.
