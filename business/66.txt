Uber co-founder Garrett Camp is launching his own cryptocurrency Eco with an initial issue of one trillion tokens, of which 50% would be given away to the first one billion people that sign up. Interestingly, there will be no ICO, which means the project would not be crowdsourced. Meanwhile, Camp-founded venture fund Expa would seed the foundation with $10 million.
