LinkedIn has revealed that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff in an email said that the company was willing to go “much higher” than Microsoft's bid to acquire LinkedIn. While LinkedIn could still go with another bid, its deal with Microsoft contains a $725 million breakup fee provision. Earlier in June this year, Microsoft agreed to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.
