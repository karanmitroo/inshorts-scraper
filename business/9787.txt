A day-long nationwide strike is being held by 10 Central Trade Unions on Friday against the Centre’s alleged ‘anti-labour’ policies. This time,​ the strike will be bigger than last year as over 15 crore workers will join it, the trade unions claimed. Sectors like coal, oil and gas, transport, banking and insurance are likely to get affected, an official said.
