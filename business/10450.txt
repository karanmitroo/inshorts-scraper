Hershey Trust, which controls chocolate maker Hershey's, has reached a deal with a US Attorney General to reform management practices, ending an investigation into the nonprofit group. The trust, which faced allegations of higher spending by board members, agreed to changes including term limits and compensation caps. The trust had rejected a $23 billion takeover by Mondelez last month.
