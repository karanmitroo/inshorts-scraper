Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, has said that demand for gold was not affected by Bitcoin price gains because the two have different investor pools. Currie added that there is "no evidence of a mass exodus from gold". He further said that Bitcoin's characteristics do not attract long-term investors, who enjoy the stability of gold.
