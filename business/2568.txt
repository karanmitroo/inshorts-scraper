India's wholesale inflation, measured by Wholesale Price Index (WPI), expanded to 3.24% in August as against a year ago, marking its fastest pace in four months, according to government data. The increase was mainly driven by higher prices of food and fuel products. Notably, India's retail inflation also hit a five-month high of 3.36% in August.
