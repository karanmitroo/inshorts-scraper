Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley on Friday said that West Bengal needed to be business-friendly if it were to create jobs by attracting investments. "At present, two states in the country are having revenue deficits – they are Kerala and West Bengal… It is because of the model followed by the Left governments in these two states,” he added.
