Mumbai petrol pumps will remain closed from Friday midnight to 5:00 am on Saturday morning. This step was reportedly taken in anticipation of law and order issues as petrol pumps would not be able to accept old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes after midnight. The Petrol Dealers’ Association had already written and informed the state level coordinator about the matter.
