State-run carrier Air India “significantly” understated its losses, and couldn't meet most performance targets, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said in a report tabled on Friday. The airline incurred a book loss of ₹671 crore on selling five aircraft at lower prices, and had to pay ₹325 crore towards interest on loans availed to procure these aircraft, it added.
