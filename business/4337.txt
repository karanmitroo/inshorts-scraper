The Chinese government has provisionally approved nine trademarks for US President Donald Trump's organisation that it had previously rejected. The approval comes amid Trump fighting allegations that his businesses create potential conflicts of interest that may violate the US Constitution. Notably, the Trump Organisation now has at least 125 trademarks in China formally or provisionally approved.
