According to reports, the Indian government will most likely miss its disinvestment target for the 6th time in a row and for the 16th time in 25 years. "We will disinvest only when the government gets the right price", Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. Under the disinvestment strategy, the government will sell stake in Public Sector Undertakings to raise funds.
