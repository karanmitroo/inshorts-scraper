The government has managed to introduce about ₹5 lakh crore in new notes, according to a senior official. This is less than a third of the total value of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes (₹15.5 lakh crore) withdrawn from circulation after demonetisation. Further, the government expects that in the coming 20 days, the economy would not suffer for want of currency.
