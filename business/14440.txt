Addressing the Banks Association on Monday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government may consider reducing its stake in the state-run banks to 52%. “Public sector banks have to be given a lot of independence and an arms length distance from political decision making,” he said. He added the government is ready to unveil the draft of Bankruptcy Code soon.
