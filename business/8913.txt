The government has doubled the monetary limit in case of excise duty evasion to ₹2 crore, the Central Board of Excise and Customs said. The move aims to maintain uniformity of practice in central excise and service tax. In October 2015, the monetary limit for excise related offences was set at ₹1 crore.
