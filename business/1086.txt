McDonald's India's estranged partner Vikram Bakshi alleged that the US fast food giant follows "double standards" for food safety and supplies in India. Bakshi's statement came after McDonald's India alleged lapses in food quality and safety by "all facets of the supply chain". Bakshi said it is "indeed ironic" that McDonald's conscience has suddenly awakened on food safety in India.
