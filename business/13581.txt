BlackBerry on Monday announced to shut all its operations in Pakistan after the government left "no choice but to exit the country entirely". The Pakistan government was seeking "unfettered" access to the information of all the users of BlackBerry Enterprise Services in the country. "Remaining in Pakistan would have meant forfeiting our commitment to protect our users' privacy," BlackBerry said.
