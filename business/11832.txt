Maharashtra government has decided to ban setting up new sugar mills in all eight districts in the drought-hit Marathwada region for five years. "The government should ensure that any district with less than 700 mm rainfall should not be allowed sugarcane cultivation," a government panel had recommended. Maharashtra also plans to make drip-irrigation compulsory for sugarcane farms in the state.
