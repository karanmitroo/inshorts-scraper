Tata Sons independent director and former diplomat Ronen Sen has accused ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry of 'orchestrating leaks' of confidential and internal documents in a selective and motivated manner by sources close to him. Sen further dismissed speculation that he had complimented Mistry's performance as the group's Chairman but then later voted for his dismissal.
