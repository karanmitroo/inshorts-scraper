The Health Ministry has banned the sale and manufacture of over 300 combination drugs that are being sold in India without government approval. In 2014, the government had set up a committee to review over 6,000 combination drugs that had entered the market based only on state regulators' approval. The drugs were banned based on the assessment of these products.
