The Income Tax Department has extended the last date for filing of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the financial year 2016-17 to August 5 from the original deadline of July 31. The department cited difficulties faced by the taxpayers as the reason for extending the deadline. Notably, the department has already received over two crore returns filed electronically.
