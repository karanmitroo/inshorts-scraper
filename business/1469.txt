A vintage Patek Philippe wristwatch was sold for about $2.9 million at an auction in Hong Kong on Sunday. This is the highest price a wristwatch has ever fetched in an auction in Asia. The 18-carat gold wristwatch, consigned by an Asian collector, dates back to 1953 and features blue enamel decor and an engine-turned dial.
