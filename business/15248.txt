The Delhi Government on Wednesday rejected fresh applications for licenses by US-based cab aggregator Uber and two other taxi service providers- Ola and TaxiForSure. These companies failed to submit an affidavit giving details like number and addresses of the drivers associated with them and how they perform background checks, hence their request has been rejected, the Delhi government said.
