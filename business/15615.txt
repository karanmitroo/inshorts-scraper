India's foreign exchange reserves climbed by $1.39 bn to a record high of $341.38 billion after the week ending on March 27. The previous record of $339.99 billion had been set the week before. Gains in foreign currency are being attributed to the RBI's efforts to mop up dollar inflows in the Indian market through the state-run banks.
