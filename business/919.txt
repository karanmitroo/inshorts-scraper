At least three traders in Old Delhi were hit by hackers who encrypted files on their computers and demanded ransom in Bitcoins to release them. Police said the hackers gave the option to traders to get five encrypted files for free to show that they are in control. The traders were also given links to buy Bitcoins, the police added.
