Gold prices increased for the seventh consecutive day on Saturday to surge to a nine-month high of ₹27,700 and ₹27,550 per ten grams for gold of 99.9% and 99.5% purity respectively. Bullion traders attributed the rise to domestic wedding season-triggered jewellery demand and global cues like a sell-off in equities and signs of uneven economic growth in the US.
