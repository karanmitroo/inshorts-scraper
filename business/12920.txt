McDonald's posted its best quarterly profit in almost four years. The companyâ€™s strong quarter has been largely attributed to the launch of its 'all-day breakfast' in the US. Total sales at its restaurants globally rose almost twice the analysts' expectations. The world's biggest restaurant chain's shares rose to a record-high of $121.90 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
