Brazilian telecommunications firm Oi has filed for bankruptcy protection on a $19 billion debt, the biggest such filing in Brazil, after failing to reach an agreement with its creditors. According to reports, the company is Brazil's largest fixed-line and fourth-biggest mobile operator. This comes as the country is facing a severe recession, reportedly the biggest in nearly eight decades.
