RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that the central bank will soon issue guidelines to strengthen the protection of consumers to complement the government's financial inclusion initiative. He further added that the bank is working on a common risk-based know-your-customer (KYC) which is simple, accessible and can be used by all financial regulators for basic products.
