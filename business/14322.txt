Delhi High Court restrained Indian firm Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday from manufacturing, selling, marketing or exporting its Zita and Zita-Met anti-diabetes drugs. The court charged Glenmark of patent infringement of US-based Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp, by using active molecule sitagliptin in its drugs. The court did not rule Glenmark to pay a compensation but only the litigation costs.
