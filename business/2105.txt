India needs to invest up to $45 billion to create an additional capacity of handling 500-600 million passengers at its airports by 2030, aviation think-tank CAPA said. CAPA notes that airports at Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Kolkata will reach their maximum capacity in the next 1-5 years. Additionally, 10 other airports in India are already operating "beyond their design capacity".
