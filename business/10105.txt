Former Deutsche Bank employee Eric Ben-Artzi refused a $8.25 million award for exposing the bankâ€™s misdeeds because regulatory authorities did not do enough to punish the executives responsible for the wrongdoing. Ben-Artzi claimed that only shareholders of Deutsche Bank were penalised by the $55 million fine for overvaluing their portfolios after the 2008 global financial crisis.
