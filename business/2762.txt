The Delhi HC on Monday dismissed a petition filed by Vodafone India, that demanded regulator TRAI to hand over its cost model of Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC). Vodafone argued that not sharing the cost model amounted to a violation of principles of natural justice. While operators Vodafone, Airtel, and Idea are against lowering IUC, Jio wants it to be scrapped.
