The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, aimed at bringing transparency in the sector by creating a consumer rights protection umbrella, was passed in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. A real estate regulator will be established to monitor transactions and settle disputes between buyers and builders. Further, builders will have to pay an interest to buyers for defaults or delays.
