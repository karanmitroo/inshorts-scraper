Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani has passed an order to recover unauthorised payments made to employees. The order paves way to recover money from the salary of Chief Vigilance Officer Shobha Ohatker, who has been charged with misusing her position and mistreating public funds. She allegedly used Air India funds to stay in hotels and to fly to different destinations.
