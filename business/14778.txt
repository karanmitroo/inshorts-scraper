Delhi High Court dismissed a plea by cab operator Ola Cabs on Tuesday, which challenged a single judge order upholding the Delhi government's ban on such operators. A division bench dismissed the plea. Ola had earlier told the bench that the single judge order had overlooked the Supreme Court's decision on the kind of taxis plying on city roads.
