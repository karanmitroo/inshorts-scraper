UK-based Bitcoin exchange Exmo was hit by a Distributed Denial of Server (DDoS) cyber attack on Thursday, just days after one of Exmo's leading analysts was kidnapped. The hack, which Exmo confirmed in a post on Twitter, briefly shut down the exchange's site. However, Exmo said it is still unclear if the cyber attack had any connection to the kidnapping.
