US President-elect Donald Trump's nomination for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has urged countries to take advantage of Britain exiting the EU, saying it is a "God-given opportunity" to take businesses away from UK. Ross supports Trump's ideology according to which new trades must narrow US trade deficit, and support growth. Notably, UK has a trade surplus with the US.
