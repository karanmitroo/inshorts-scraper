The RBI will shortly issue ₹50 banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series bearing the signature of Governor Urjit Patel. The base colour of the note will be fluorescent blue, and all ₹50 banknotes issued by RBI earlier will continue to be legal tender. Further, the new denomination will have a motif of 'Hampi with Chariot', depicting India's cultural heritage.
