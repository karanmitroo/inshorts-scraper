Congress has sent legal notice to ex-CAG Vinod Rai, for his attacks on former PM Manmohan Singh, in the 2G spectrum scam and Coalgate. Rai had questioned Manmohan's integrity as the head of the Union Cabinet when major scams took place under his nose. "...in 2G and coal there is no way he (Singh) can shirk responsibility," Rai had said.
