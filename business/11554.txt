Bharti Airtel on Thursday said its Netherlands-based subsidiary has signed a definitive agreement to sell-and-leaseback nearly 950 telecommunications towers in the Democratic Republic of Congo to Helios Tower Africa. The move is part of the company's efforts to reduce its ₹83,888 crore debt. Airtel has 14,000 towers in Africa, of which it has divested 8,300 for $1.7 billion (₹11,318 crore).
