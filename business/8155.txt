The government will start issuing the new ₹500 and ₹2,000 currency notes from November 10, said Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das. While the new ₹500 notes feature the Red Fort, the new ₹2,000 notes feature ISRO's Mars orbiter Mangalyaan. The move comes after PM Narendra Modi announced that ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes will be invalid effective November 8 midnight.
