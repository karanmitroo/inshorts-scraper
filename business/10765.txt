Kingfisher Airlines' executives told the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) that the airline's accounts have been lost as an IT vendor pulled out the computer system which stored them, a report said. The airline further claimed that no backup had been maintained. The SFIO had earlier begun investigation on the now defunct airline amid allegations of financial irregularities.
