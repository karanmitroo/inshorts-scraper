The government on Friday listed the GST Bill for consideration and passage in the Rajya Sabha next week. Earlier, the Cabinet had on Wednesday approved key changes to the bill, dropping the 1% additional tax on inter-state sales. It also provided guarantee to compensate states for any revenue loss in the first five years of the tax regime's rollout.
