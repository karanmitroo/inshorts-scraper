The owners of a three-foot-long rabbit, which was expected to become the world's biggest rabbit but died on a United flight, have alleged that the airline cremated it without their consent. Their lawyer alleged the rabbit was locked in a freezer for 16 hours by mistake, and that's how it died. The owners are demanding an undisclosed payment for damages.
