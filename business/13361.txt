The World Gold Council (WGC) on Friday said that Asian markets' demand for gold is expected to sustain 2015's bullish market sentiment next year. “The pro-gold schemes introduced by the Indian government and the further internationalisation of the renminbi (Chinese currency) alongside the increasing transparency of Chinese gold reserves will continue to improve the market next year,” the WGC said.
