Indian flour millers and global trading companies have sewn up deals to import 500,000 tonnes of premium Australian wheat since March. Trade sources said these were the biggest such purchases in more than a decade despite surplus stocks at home. The orders were reportedly placed over fears of reduced output of high-protein varieties of wheat due to rains in February.
