Pakistan Finance Minister Ishaq Dar blamed miscommunication by “individuals” and institutions for the rupee’s biggest fall in nine years. Dar said rupee’s 3.1% drop on Wednesday against the dollar was “mind boggling” and there was no reason to weaken the currency. The State Bank of Pakistan’s Deputy Governor wasn’t aware of the decline, Dar said, which will be probed.
