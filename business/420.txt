A group of cryptocurrency traders plan to sue Japanese exchange Coincheck on Thursday over last month's theft of $530 million in cryptocurrency, according to reports. The lawsuit will demand Coincheck to allow withdrawals of cryptocurrencies to wallets outside the exchange. The exchange had frozen all withdrawals of yen and cryptocurrencies following the heist.
