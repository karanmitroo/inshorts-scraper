Former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta who's serving a two-year jail term, failed to get an insider trading conviction overturned on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected Gupta's arguments that his tips to Galleon Group founder and long-time friend Raj Rajaratnam about the bank's financial results and an investment were not illegal since he didn't receive anything in return.
