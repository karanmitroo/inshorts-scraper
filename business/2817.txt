The Australian government has said it is still negotiating with Adani Enterprises over details of its royalties agreement for its $16.5 billion Carmichael mine, despite the deal being officially agreed on May 30. However, an Adani spokesperson said there were "no ongoing negotiations". This comes after Adani announced it would start work on the project in October using own funds.
