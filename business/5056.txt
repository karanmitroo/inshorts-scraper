Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio will continue to pursue its pricing strategy of sharp discounts and complimentary services for the next 12-18 months, according to reports. This will allow Jio to gather 15% of India’s wireless subscribers, keeping the competition as fierce as ever, reports added. Further, Jio’s strategy will increase pressure on incumbents in terms of average revenue per user.
