PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that India's cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9% and that it was 12% before demonetisation. Defending his government on inflation, PM Modi said the inflation has dramatically reduced from 10% in 2014 to 2.5% in 2017. Some people don't get sound sleep if they don't criticise the government, he added.
