In a move aimed at combatting air pollution, Germany's Federal Administrative Court on Tuesday ruled in favour of allowing major cities to ban diesel cars. The court's ruling came after an appeal was filed by two German states against bans imposed by local courts. The campaign to impose strict measures against polluting vehicles gained strength after the Volkswagen emissions scandal.
