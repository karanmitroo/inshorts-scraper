The Reserve Bank of India has found about 200 entities in West Bengal that have been collecting deposits in an unauthorised manner, officials said. The fraudulent entities claim they have RBI registration and offer cheap, risky loans without proper documentation, RBI Regional Director Rekha Warriar said. A state-level committee is reviewing market intelligence to fight these entities, she added.
