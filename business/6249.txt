In a security breach, a passenger onboard an IndiGo flight opened the emergency exit door of the aircraft before it could take off which led to the flight being held up for nearly two hours. The passenger was offloaded and handed over to the security staff at the Mumbai airport. An FIR has been filed against the flier, IndiGo added.
