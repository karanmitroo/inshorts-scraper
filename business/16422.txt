Twitter co-founder Evan Williams has retaliated to reports saying that Instagram has more users than Twitter, by saying that he doesn't "give a s**t if Instagram has more people looking at pretty pictures." He also added that the microblogging site Twitter makes more money and has a greater impact as world leaders communicate with the world through the platform.
