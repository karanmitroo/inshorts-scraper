Reliance Jio and Competition Commission of India (CCI) have moved the Supreme Court challenging an order quashing a cartelisation probe into Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea. Bombay High Court had quashed the CCI's order to probe Jio's complaint of cartelisation against the telcos in September 2017. Jio alleged the firms denied interconnection points, causing failure of calls made by its customers.
