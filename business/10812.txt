The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared the Model Shops and Establishments Bill, which will permit movie theatres, malls, and other such business to remain open 24x7. The Bill will cover all public amusement establishments that have at least 10 employees and are not covered under the Factories Act 1948. Currently, only larger manufacturing units and service-sector firms can operate 24x7.
