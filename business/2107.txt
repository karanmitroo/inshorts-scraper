According to the Registration Act, 1908, the registration of a rent agreement is mandatory if leasing period is 12 months or more. If the agreement is registered, stamp duty and registration fee should be paid. It is to avoid paying these charges that many landlords and tenants mutually agree to sign agreement for 11 months and not get it registered.
