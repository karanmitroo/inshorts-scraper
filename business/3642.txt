UK retailer Boots has said it is "truly sorry" for the way it responded to a campaign calling for it to cut the price of emergency contraception and said it is looking for cheaper alternatives. The announcement came amid calls for boycott. Boots earlier said it wouldn't lower the morning-after pill's price because it didn't want to 'incentivise inappropriate use'.
