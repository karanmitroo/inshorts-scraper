China's foreign exchange reserves fell by $27.9 billion in May to $3.19 trillion, its lowest level since December 2011, the country's central bank data suggested. Stronger valuation of the dollar and non-intervention of China's central bank in the foreign exchange market to curtail the fall in reserves led to the drop, analysts said. China has the world's largest forex reserves.
