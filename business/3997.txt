Oil company Shell has pulled down life-sized cardboard cutouts of a female employee from all of its Malaysian petrol stations after people posted photos of themselves groping the figure. The viral images showed men kissing the cutout, holding its hand, and even touching its chest. Shell stated that it found the actions of the men "disrespectful" and "distasteful".
