Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday defended the government's decision to lower interest rates on PPF and national small savings, saying the move will make the "economy efficient rather than sluggish". Given the direction in which the economy is moving, we cannot have a situation where the banks' lending rates go down and the deposit rates are high, he added.
