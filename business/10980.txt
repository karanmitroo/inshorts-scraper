State-run telecom firm BSNL on Thursday said it has extended its free roaming service by one more year allowing customers to receive calls while roaming at no extra cost. The service was started in June last year. The decision was taken in view of the overwhelming response from customers in the mobile number portability scheme, a BSNL director said.
