Cognizant expects to "significantly" ramp up headcount in the US after criticism from President Donald Trump's administration on outsourcing firms for unfairly taking away jobs from American workers. "We are shifting our workforce rapidly in the US with more US jobs and US delivery centres," Cognizant's Rajeev Mehta said. Earlier, Infosys announced it would hire 10,000 Americans over two years.
