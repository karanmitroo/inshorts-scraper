Indiaâ€™s largest cigarette maker ITC is set to increase prices of its leading cigarette brands by 11-13%, according to retailers. Packs with the new price tags will hit retail stores this week, they added. The increase in cigarette prices was expected as the Union Budget on February 1 had proposed hiking the excise duty on cigarettes between 2.5% and 6%.
