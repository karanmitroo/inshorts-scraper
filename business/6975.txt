US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a hefty tariff on General Motors if the Detroit-based company does not manufacture its automobiles in the country. "General Motors is sending Mexican made models of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across the border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!", tweeted Trump.
