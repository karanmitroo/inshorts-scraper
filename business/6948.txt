Billionaire investor Warren Buffett had once said he consumes 750 calories a day from Coca-Cola, which implies that he drinks five cans of Coke a day on average. Buffett further joked that at this point, his body is one-quarter Coke. He made the statement to defend his company Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Coca-Cola, which is the beverage firm's largest shareholder.
