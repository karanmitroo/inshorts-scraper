Chipotle CEO Steve Ells received a bigger compensation package in 2016 of $15.7 million (over â‚¹100 crore) despite the burrito chain's poor performance. This came despite the company's stock declining 8% last year as it recovered from a fallout from food safety incidents in 2015. Earlier, Ells had criticised rivals like McDonald's over their food quality.
