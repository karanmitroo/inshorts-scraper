High street retailer Primark has issued an urgent recall over a pair of children's cat-print leggings over fears that they could present a safety hazard. The company has offered a full refund to customers who bought the leggings. Primark explained that a bow attached to the leggings could become a choking hazard if it detaches itself from the clothing item.
