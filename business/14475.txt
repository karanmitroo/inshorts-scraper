In a bid to boost its sales, German luxury carmaker Audi has started a fully functional mobile showroom called ‘Audi Mobile Terminal’. It “brings the showroom right to the customer’s doorstep, especially in tier II and tier III cities in India,” said Audi India’s Head. The company is targeting 2,000 customers across 30 cities over the next 12 months.
