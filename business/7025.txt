The annual output growth of eight infrastructure sectors including coal, crude oil, and steel slowed to 4.9% in November as against 6.6% in October. The slowdown was attributed to a decline in crude oil and natural gas production, and also to the demonetisation decision. Electricity generation, however, grew 10.2% year-on-year in November, compared to a 2.8% rise in previous month.
