Global software giant Accenture is set to abandon annual performance evaluation of its employees, as part of the company's efforts to streamline its internal functions. Accenture will put in place a "more fluid system," which will enable its employees to get "timely feedback" from their superiors on a continuous basis after an assignment is completed.
