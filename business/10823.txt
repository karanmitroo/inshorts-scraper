The National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Monday said it has decided to make its shares public for the first time and will file draft papers for domestic listing with Sebi by January 2017. It will reportedly pursue overseas listing by April 2017. The NSE board has also re-constituted a listing committee to push the process and seek support for self-listing.
