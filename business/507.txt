Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said that investors in unlisted firms with suspicious deals are under the Income Tax Department's scanner. "We will protect genuine investors in startups," he added. The government introduced "angel tax" in 2012, which is levied on investments made in unlisted firms at valuations considered higher than fair market valuation.
