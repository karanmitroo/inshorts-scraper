Airtel on Tuesday said Reliance Jio itself was responsible for network connectivity issues and call failures, saying they are due to Jio’s “under-preparedness”, insufficient testing, and acquiring large number of customers at the pre-launch stage. Enough points of interconnection have been given to Jio for 20-25 million subscribers, Airtel said, adding that Jio has failed to deploy full capacity.
