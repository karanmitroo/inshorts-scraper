The government on Monday said that billing service charge in addition to taxes at hotels and restaurants is completely discretionary and if a customer is dissatisfied with the experience he/she can choose not to pay the service charge. This comes after the government received complaints from consumers that restaurants are charging 'service charge' in the range of 5-20%.
