The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has issued new norms restricting the transfer of Participatory Notes (P-Notes). Under this, these offshore instruments can be transferred only to Sebi-authorised entities, provided a prior consent of the issuing foreign investor is obtained. P-Notes are issued for overseas entities seeking to invest in the Indian market without getting registered.
