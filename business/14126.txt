Owing to a cut in cotton imports by China, Indian government will buy cotton on a large scale from Indian farmers for the second year running, according to industry officials. The state-run Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) said it would buy as much cotton as farmers wanted to sell. Fifty procurement centres have been opened by the CCI, so far.
