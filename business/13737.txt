The Telangana government announced it is working on a policy to tax all e-commerce companies. "The proposal is to set up a common server and to see to it that no one is out of the tax purview," Telangana's commerce minister said. We need to amend the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act to widen the tax base, he added.
