Tata Sons has filed an affidavit in the Delhi High Court, objecting to the $1.17 billion London Court of International Arbitration award in favour of Japan-based NTT DoCoMo. This comes in contrast with Tata's earlier statement wherein it deposited the entire award with the court. Tata was ordered to pay a compensation to DoCoMo for breaching an agreement.
