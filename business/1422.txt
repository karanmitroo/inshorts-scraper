A McDonald's security guard in the UK asked a Muslim woman to remove her hijab while she was standing in the queue to place an order. The woman termed it a hate crime and filmed a video of the incident. The fast-food chain has apologised and stated that it doesn't have any policy preventing customers from wearing their religious attire.
