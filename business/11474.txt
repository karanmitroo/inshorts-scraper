Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm on Wednesday launched its digital wallet service 'JioMoney Digital Wallet'. The wallet app is available on both the Android and iOS platforms. It will let users make bill payments, shop online and send and receive money. The Reserve Bank of India in 2015 granted license to the Reliance Industries to set up a payments bank.
