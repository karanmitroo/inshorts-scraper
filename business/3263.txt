Former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling revealed that during a phone call in 2008, the then Chairman of Royal bank of Scotland Tom McKillop said, "We're going to run out of money in the early afternoon". This came when the Chancellor asked how long the bank would last. Notably, the government bailed out RBS in the same year.
