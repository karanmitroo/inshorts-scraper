China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce has banned companies from registering odd and long names. Names of existing companies such as "Shanghai Wife Biggest Electronic Commerce" and "Hangzhou No Trouble Looking for Trouble Internet Technology" will not be allowed under the new rules. Company names deemed offensive or racist or having religious connotations have also been banned.
