Apple on Tuesday reported a 22.5% fall in profit to $10.5 billion for the quarter ended March, as revenue declined for the first time since 2003 to $50.6 billion. The fall was attributed to the first ever drop in the sales of iPhones in the device's near-nine-year history to nearly 51.2 million units, down 10 million from the year-ago period.
