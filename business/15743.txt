Cairn India has received a $3.3 billion (Rs 204bn) demand from the Income Tax Department for failure to deduct tax on gains when selling its majority stake to Vedanta in 2011. Cairn India has decided to contest the demand, few days after its former parent Cairn Energy Plc filed a dispute against a $1.6 billion fine for the same transaction.
