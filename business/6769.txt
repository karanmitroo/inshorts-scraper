US President-elect Donald Trump has said Britain's exit from the European Union "is going to end up being a great thing". “You look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out,” he stated. Trump further said he expects other countries to leave as well.
