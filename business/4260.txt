Small businesses have been given enough time to prepare for the July 1 roll-out of GST, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said. "We have been saying for the last six months it would be July 1, nobody has any business not to be ready," Jaitley said. "Industry and trade have to prepare themselves. It's not a complicated process," he added.
