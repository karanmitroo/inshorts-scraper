US-based chocolate maker Mars Inc will invest Rs 1,005 crore (over $160 million) through Mars International India, to set up a manufacturing plant in Pune. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the company and the Maharashtra Government on Wednesday. The setting up of the plant means that the company will no longer import chocolate brands 'Snickers' and 'Galaxy'.
