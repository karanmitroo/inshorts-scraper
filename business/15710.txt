American phone company AT&T will pay a $40 million fine in a patent-infringement case. AT&T lawyers had neglected to read and compare a faulty court notice, and were unable to file an appeal within the stipulated 30 days. AT&T had later filed an appeal citing "excusable neglect" to the US court of Appeals which was rejected.
