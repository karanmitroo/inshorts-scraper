Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency comprising computer codes that are signed each time it travels from one owner to the next. The anonymous transactions are verified by "miners" who perform complex calculations to maintain a secure network called the "block chain". The miners then receive bitcoin for their services and the cycle continues to generate more of the cryptocurrency.
