Telecom regulator TRAI's Chairman RS Sharma has said customers will soon be able to check tariff plans of different operators on TRAI's website, improving transparency over rates. He further said TRAI is considering allowing 'export' of that data to enable people to build tariff-comparison apps. Notably, TRAI recently asked operators to start filing their tariffs in electronic form as well.
