Toshiba president Hisao Tanaka, vice chairman Norio Sasaki and six other high-level executives and directors of the Japanese firm resigned on Tuesday over a $1.2 billion accounting scandal. Hisao and other senior executives stepped down after an independent investigation found that the companyâ€™s top management was involved in "systematically" inflating profits over several years.
