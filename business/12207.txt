Cuba's Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodriguez has announced plans to eliminate the 10% tax imposed on US dollars entering the country. The United States had recently announced that it would ease the financial and trade restrictions it had imposed on Cuba. The tax will be eliminated only after the verification of the effectiveness of the US measures, Rodriguez added.
