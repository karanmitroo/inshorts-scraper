After conservative commentator Ann Coulter insulted Delta Air Lines staff and a fellow passenger, the airline tweeted, "your insults about our other customers and employees are unacceptable and unnecessary." Coulter claimed she was asked to change a pre-booked seat, for which she paid an extra $30 for additional legroom, to accommodate another passenger. Delta said it would refund her $30.
