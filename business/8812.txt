IT company Infosys' CEO Vishal Sikka said that there is no friction with any of the company's founders, "especially Narayana Murthy". "We may be from different generations, but the culture at Infosys remains the same. Keep taking advice from Narayana Murthy," he stated. The attrition rate of 20% was not a function of the cultural shift at Infosys, he added.
