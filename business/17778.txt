At least seven fund houses have raised a red flag over Suzuki's plan to set up a manufacturing facility in Gujarat and asked for a "rethink". On Jan-28, the company's board had announced a decision to let Suzuki Motor Corporation set up a 100% subsidiary in Gujarat. Maruti Suzuki will source products from this facility, it had said.
