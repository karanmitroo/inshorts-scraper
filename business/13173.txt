National Payments Corporation of Indiaâ€™s (NPCI) unified payments interface (UPI) is reportedly set to go live in April. UPI would allow users to integrate different bank accounts on a unified mobile application and transfer funds using a single identifier, thereby eliminating the exchange of sensitive financial information during transactions. Thirty banks have agreed to start UPI-based services.
