Union Minister Jayant Sinha on Thursday said that the Ministry of Civil Aviation has requested the Finance Ministry to include jet fuel under the ambit of GST. Jet fuel is a major cost component for airlines which constitutes between 35-40% of the overall expenses. Currently, petrochemical products like jet fuel don't come under the ambit of the GST.
