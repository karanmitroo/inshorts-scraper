The government has extended the ban on importing milk products from China till June 23, 2015.

The ban was first imposed in September 2008, due to presence of Melamine, a chemical used in plastic and fertilizer production.

India, however, doesn't import milk products from China, but as a preventive measure, it has imposed the ban, which is extended every year.
