The world's largest long-haul carrier Emirates has changed its pilot and attendant rosters on flights to the US following President Donald Trump's immigration ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. This has been done as the ban applies to pilots and flight attendants from the seven countries. Notably, Emirates employs over 23,000 flight attendants and about 4,000 pilots from around the world.
