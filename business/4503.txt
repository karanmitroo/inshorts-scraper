The government is looking at "alternatives" to make Air India and other public sector units more competitive and profitable, Union Minister Jayant Sinha said. "Our objective is to transform the public sector carrier to a great global airline and we're doing whatever possible in this regard," he added. A decision on privatisation of the airline is likely in three months.
