FICCI President Pankaj Patel has said that RBI's policies were "anti-growth" and "not industry-friendly", and posed a hurdle in the country's economic growth. Stressing that there should be a balance between growth, inflation and interest rates, he said, "We want a drop in interest rate." Notably, RBI kept the repo rate unchanged at 6% in its latest policy review.
