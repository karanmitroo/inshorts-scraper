SEBI has reportedly asked business networking service LinkedIn if it provides a platform for people or startups to raise money publicly in violation of the Companies Act. Under the Act, no entity can raise investments from more than 200 investors without making a public issue of securities offered. However, LinkedIn denied being involved in activities related to the securities market.
