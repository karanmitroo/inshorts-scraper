RBI, which has been making gold imports more difficult through many restrictions, is discussing with banks on how to convince rich temple trusts, like Tirupati and Shirdi, to deposit their hoard of jewellery that could be converted into bullion, sources said. Gold imports worth $53.6-billion last year are blamed for rupee's slide, accounting for 61% of the current account deficit(FY-2013).
