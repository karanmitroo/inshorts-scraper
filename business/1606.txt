Airbus announced its single-biggest commercial-plane deal ever, securing an order valued at $49.5 billion for 430 aircraft from its A320neo family. The deal is with US private equity firm Indigo Partners and the planes will go to four airline companies in Indigo's investment portfolio. Airbus said the deal would be finalised before the end of this year.
