Cellular network Idea on Thursday said it would move all its prepaid subscribers to per-second billing over the next 30 days. The shift was made to reportedly address the issue of call drops as customers need not pay for the entire minute in case of a call drop. Earlier, Airtel announced plans to move all prepaid users to per-second billing.
