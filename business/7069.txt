Technology major Toshiba has seen around $6.8 billion of its market value wiped off in three days since December 26, after it warned that its US nuclear business may be worth less than expected. Shares of the Tokyo-listed company fell over 40% over this period. The loss comes amid Toshiba recovering from an accounting dispute which claimed three presidents' jobs.
