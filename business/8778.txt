The New Development Bank, formed by the BRICS nations last year, is targeting to more than double its lending to $2.5 billion in 2017, President KV Kamath said on Sunday. The commitment will largely be in sustainable and green infrastructure projects, he stated. While expanding lending activities, NDB will seek to reduce the cost of borrowing for member-countries, Kamath added.
