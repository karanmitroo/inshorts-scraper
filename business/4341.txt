Sandeep Dadlani, the head of Americas and global head of manufacturing and retail for Infosys, has resigned. Dadlani, who was among the four presidents at Infosys, was managing nearly a third of the IT giant's $10.2 billion revenue. Dadlaniâ€™s departure comes amid Sikka seeking to put Infosys back on the growth path as the company's management faces criticism from founders.
