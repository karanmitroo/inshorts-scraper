Swedish defence major Saab has tied up with Indian manufacturing conglomerate Kalyani Group to form a joint venture for an air missile production contract. The company will handle the main part of production and delivery of air defence systems if it wins an ongoing tender process. Notably, the government increased the FDI limit in defence sector to 49% last year.
