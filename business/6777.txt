Prasar Bharati Chairman A Surya Prakash on Sunday said that allowing private FM stations to air news might have security implications. The government needs to keep this in mind, he added. The idea of allowing them to do so looks "simple", but given India's security concerns, which has thousands of kilometres of borders, the move has many "implications," he said.
