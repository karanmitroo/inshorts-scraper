The US has proposed fining United Airlines $435,000 (nearly â‚¹3 crore) for operating 23 flights in 2014 with a plane that allegedly wasn't in airworthy condition. United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on the plane in 2014 after an employee noted a problem. However, it reportedly didn't perform a required inspection of work before the plane flew again.
