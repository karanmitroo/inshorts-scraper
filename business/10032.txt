The appointment of Urjit Patel as the next RBI Governor signals the governmentâ€™s preference for policy continuity and commitment to low inflation, Japan-based financial services major Nomura has said. The move will be viewed as an attempt to reaffirm RBI's independence, keeping investors positive, the company added. Notably, the RBI on Saturday appointed Patel as its 24th Governor.
