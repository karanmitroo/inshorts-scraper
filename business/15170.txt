Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications is in talks with Russia's Sistema for a merger with their Indian telecom businesses, the company said. The merger could take place through a stock swap. However, Reliance said, "There is no certainty that any transaction will result." The announcement comes days after elder brother Mukesh Ambani set December deadline for launching his 4G phone services.
