Competition Commission of India (CCI) Chairman Devender Sikri, in a letter, asked telecom regulator TRAI to consult CCI on issues of market dominance and predatory pricing. He added such issues may be at the "intersection of regulation and competition". The debate on predatory pricing started after Reliance Jio launched an array of free services, drawing criticism from rivals.
