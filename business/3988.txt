The Advertising Standard Council Of India (ASCI) has upheld complaints against leading brands such as Amazon, Foodpanda, Hindustan Unilever, and Godrej. According to a list released by ASCI, as many as 130 advertisements were found misleading. One such soap advertisement read "Buy 3 Get 1 Free" but did not mention that the fourth pack is not of the same size.
