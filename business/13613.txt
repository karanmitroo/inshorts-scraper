The RBI on Thursday allowed foreign investors to buy corporate bonds and non-convertible debentures (NCDs), either fully or partially under default in repayment. Further, it raised the maturity period of such bonds/NCDs to three years or more. Reportedly, the measure is aimed at alleviating stress in the banking sector where bad assets currently amount to over â‚¹7.5 lakh crore.
