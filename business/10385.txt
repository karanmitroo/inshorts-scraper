The Turkish military coup attempt has cost the country over a $100 billion (300 billion Lira), Trade Minister Bulent Tufenkci said. Adding that the coup made Turkey look like a third world country, he said the estimate could rise. The Turkish Lira reportedly fell 8% against the US dollar following the failed coup but has recovered half its losses since.
