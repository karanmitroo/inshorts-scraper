Owing to low demand and a resultant inventory pile-up, Tata Motors has shut its manufacturing plant in Sanand, Gujarat, where the Nano is manufactured, for 35 to 40 days. Notably, the production of Nano in FY-14 was the lowest at 21k units, which is not even 10% of Sanand's annual capacity of 2.5 lakh units.
