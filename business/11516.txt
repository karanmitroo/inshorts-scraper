The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on Monday released the details of around 200 offshore companies found in the 'Panama Papers' leaked from law firm Mossack Fonseca. The 'structured data', available for download, contains details of shareholders, beneficiaries, intermediaries and addresses. However, ICIJ will not release the 11.5 million files leaked from Fonseca's database.
