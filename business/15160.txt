The BSE Sensex on Wednesday went up 146 points to 26,833 and the Nifty increased 44 points to 8,092. Cipla, HUL, Reliance, Hindalco and Tata Steel were the major gainers, while Vedanta, BHEL, Tata Power and Bajaj Auto were the major losers. The surge was reportedly due to the expectation that the US Federal Reserve would not raise rates soon.
