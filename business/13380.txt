United States Federal Reserve on Wednesday hiked the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.25-0.50%, in its first rate hike in nearly a decade. The move is being seen as an end to loose US monetary policy after the Federal Reserve cut lending rates to near-zero in response to the global financial crisis in 2008.
