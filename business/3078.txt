Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy said he voluntarily left Infosys' board in 2014, and is not seeking "any money, position for children, or power". "I am extremely anguished by the allegations, tone and tenor of the statements," he said after Infosys blamed him for Vishal Sikka's exit. He further said it was 'below his dignity' to respond to such baseless insinuations.
