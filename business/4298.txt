The Goods and Services Tax Council on Sunday relaxed rules that require companies to file tax returns online under GST for the first two months of July and August. The council gave extra time for companies to file returns to deal with any lack of preparedness. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley maintained that GST will be rolled out on July 1.
