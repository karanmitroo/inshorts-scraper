McDonald's India's estranged partner Vikram Bakshi has moved Delhi HC challenging an arbitration award made by a London court saying it was inconsistent with previous orders by Indian tribunals. In September, the London court asked Bakshi to sell his 50% stake in local joint venture to McDonald's. In August, McDonald's had terminated its franchise agreement with the Bakshi-led joint venture.
