Net investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) stood at ₹8,127 crore in equities in August so far, as per depositors' data. However, ₹2,727 crore were withdrawn by the FPIs from the debt market, taking the total inflow to ₹5,400 crore. Experts attributed the latest inflow to the Bank of England rate cut and the GST Amendment Bill's passage.
