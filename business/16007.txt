In a fresh setback to Subrata Roy, the Sahara Group filed an affidavit against Mirach Capital Group (MCG), accusing them of fraud. US-based MCG was to arrange the bail money for Roy. Instead, they allegedly cheated the Sahara Group with a forged letter of $2 billion funding through Bank of America. MCG also received crores of rupees as facility fees.
