Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who is looking to launch Paytm Payments Bank in February, said his bank will not fight interest rate war with rivals. It will compete on the basis of return on yields, and services provided to customers, Sharma said. "Payments bank is an opportunity to give a new business model to the banking world," he added.
