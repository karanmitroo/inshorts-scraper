Chinese internet giant and WeChat owner Tencent was in talks to acquire WhatsApp in early 2014, according to Bloomberg. As the agreement neared final stages, Tencent's Founder Ma Huateng had to undergo a surgery, which delayed his meeting aimed at negotiation with WhatsApp Founder Jan Koum. Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg later acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in the same year.
