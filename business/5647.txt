Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao, while responding to a question on whether the merger with Idea was due to Reliance Jio, said, "[I]t is not just about Jio." "You all talk about Jio. But the market leader is someone else," he stated. Further, Kumar Mangalam Birla, who'll be the merged entity's Chairman, said it's "business logic" that has driven this combination.
