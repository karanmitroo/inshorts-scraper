The State Bank of India has disabled the option to transfer money to Paytm wallets from its internet banking services. "We recommend using State Bank Buddy mobile (bank's own wallet) app for Android and iOS devices", SBI tweeted. When one of the bank's users tweeted that SBI Buddy's interface is poor, Paytm replied by tweeting, "Happiness is guaranteed at Paytm".
