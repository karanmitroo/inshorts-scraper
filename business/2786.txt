Low-cost airline Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, who made £3 million (nearly ₹25 crore) last fiscal, has claimed that he is "seriously underpaid". O'Leary added that shareholders opposed to his bumper pay packet should "p*** off" while adding that he feels "unloved and under appreciated". O'Leary also slammed government proposals that would force firms to publish details of executive pay.
