Kerala MP MB Rajesh has written an open letter to Arnab Goswami, saying, "You're the most unethical journalist I have ever seen." The CPI(M) MP said Goswamiâ€™s sense of history was poorer than that of a primary school child. He further asked Goswami to watch his own "performances" to realise "how disgusting it is" and search for other career options.
