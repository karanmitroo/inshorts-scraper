After SEBI barred Vijay Mallya from securities market over alleged fund diversion, the beleaguered businessman said he was getting used to these “witch hunts" with no "legal basis". Mallya termed SEBI’s charges as "baseless". “CBI alleges diversion of funds OUT of Kingfisher Air. SEBI alleges diversion of funds from USL INTO Kingfisher Air. What joke is this?,” Mallya further tweeted.
