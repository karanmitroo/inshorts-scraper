The Japanese economy, after facing two consecutive quarters of contraction, slipped into a technical recession as domestic demand declined in the country. The economy shrank at an annualized pace of 0.8% between July-September following a 0.7% contraction between April-June. This comes two years after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power and promised economic revival with his "Abenomics".
