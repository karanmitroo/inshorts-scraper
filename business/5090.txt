Eric Vallat, CEO of the House of Rémy Martin, has said "time is a very different concept" for the cognac maker. "I will probably never see today’s eaux-de-vie spirits turn into cognac and it will be for the next generation...to experience this product," he said. Vallat further believes that cognac is a luxury product like high-end jewellery and designer bags.
