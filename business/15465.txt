Days after raiding its Mumbai office, the Maharashtra's Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Friday ordered filing of FIR against e-tailer Snapdeal's CEO Kunal Bahl, in a case related to alleged online sale of medicines. The law permits the sale of drugs only by a licensed retailer based on the prescription of a doctor, FDA commissioner Harshadeep Kamble said.
