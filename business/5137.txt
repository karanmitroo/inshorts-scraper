Air India has asked Delhi Police to explain the delay in action against Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad who was accused of thrashing an airline employee. “Any delay in taking action will give a wrong impression. The morale of the staff will also be affected,” it stated. Gaikwad was taken off Air India's no-fly list following intervention from the government.
