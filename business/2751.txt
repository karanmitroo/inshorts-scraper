McDonald's is under probe by South Korean food authorities over a possible food contamination that prompted the firm to suspend sales of its 'bulgogi' burger. Last week, some customers fell ill after consuming food at a McDonald's restaurant in Jeonju. McDonald's said it was "cooperating with the government authorities' investigation to identify the cause of the illness".
