The Telecom Commission has written to the Finance Ministry requesting it to slash the telecom department’s non-tax revenue target by 38%, citing “severe financial stress”. Non-tax revenue target for the department may be revised to ₹29,524.15 crore from a projected ₹47,304.71 crore, it stated. The sector is under stress because of “rapidly declining revenues” of all major telcos, it added.
