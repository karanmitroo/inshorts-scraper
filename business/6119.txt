Shares of Japan-based Toshiba have fallen by 60% since December 2016, when the company first warned of problems at its US nuclear power unit. Toshiba, one of Japanâ€™s best-known firms, had warned of huge losses and possible accounting fraud at the nuclear arm Westinghouse Electric. Earlier this week, Chairman Shigenori Shiga quit after the unit registered a $6.3 billion loss.
