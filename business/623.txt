India's Railway Budget has been separate from the Union Budget since 1924. The 92-year-old practice was ended in 2017 when the Railway Budget was presented along with the Union Budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that the decision was taken after the budgets of several other departments grew higher than that of the Railways.
