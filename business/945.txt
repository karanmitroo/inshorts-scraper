Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' net worth reached $105 billion on Monday which is above Bill Gates' 1999 high of $100 billion. Gates would have a net worth of more than $150 billion had he not given away his assets largely for charity. Amazon's market capitalisation reached $600 billion for the first time after its shares gained 6.6% this year.
