British Petroleum (BP) on Tuesday announced it would not go ahead with plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight. BP said the decision was purely commercial and they would instead focus on projects they can exploit in the short-to-medium term. This comes after BP's environment plan for the region had been rejected twice by the Australian government.
