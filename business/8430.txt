After his removal as Tata Group Chairman, sources said that Cyrus Mistry was given an opportunity to resign but he chose not to. The board felt Mistry was not "cut out for the job" as he did not have what it takes to be a leader, they added. Earlier, Mistry said in his letter, he was "shocked" about Tata's decision.
