The Centre has constituted a panel to frame a “tentative policy” for the disposal of low-grade coal rejects from washeries at thermal power plants. The five-member panel has been asked to submit the same in 15 days, an official said. The panel's terms of reference also include listing out amendments in the draft policy as formulated by the Coal Ministry.
