Union Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar has said that the government never talked of going 100% cashless, but even if the country achieves 15-20% success in going cashless it will be a big achievement. Cashless transactions will be an effective way to attain transparency, even if one-fifth of transactions were to take place without cash, he stated.
