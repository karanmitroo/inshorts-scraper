A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS, meant to help companies in trouble, mistreated its clients, a leaked report by Financial Conduct Authority has revealed. The report found that some "inappropriate action" like hiked interest charges or unnecessary fees, was experienced by 92% of the firms that RBS' Global Restructuring Group dealt with. However, RBS denied systematic abuse of customers.
