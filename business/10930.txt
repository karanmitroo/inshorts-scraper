Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly directed the Home Ministry to initiate a probe into the alleged tapping of phone conversations by Mumbai-based Essar Group. This comes after a Supreme Court lawyer filed a complaint with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) alleging the firm had tapped telephonic conversations of several top government officials and industrialists between 2001-2006.
