Fitch Ratings on Friday said that the 23.55% salary hike proposed by the seventh Pay Commission “would increase the central government’s wage bill by... 0.5% of GDP”. Fitch added that implementing the proposal could delay the plan of “achieving a (fiscal) deficit of 3% of GDP… targeted for 2017-18” which would “underscore a longstanding weakness for the sovereign credit profile”.
