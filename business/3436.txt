The Delhi High Court has directed Income Tax Department to not take any coercive step against NDTV over an around ₹430 crore penalty demand. The court noted the time given for deposit was "immediately now", which appeared "on the face of it illegal". The I-T department alleged that NDTV tried to evade tax on ₹642 crore investment by NBC Universal.
