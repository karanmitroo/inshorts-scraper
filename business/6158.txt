Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani recollected that he asked his father Dhirubhai Ambani, “What would I do?" to which Dhirubhai replied, “I won't tell you anything. Figure out what you want to do.” Further, Ambani said that Dhirubhai told him, "[I]f you are in a job, you are a manager. If you are an entrepreneur, you will figure it out."
