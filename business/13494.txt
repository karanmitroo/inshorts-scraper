Infrastructure company GMR Group is planning to raise at least $1 billion over the next two years, the company's Chief Financial Officer Madhu Terdal told on Monday. The funds will "partly be used to repay debt" and to "grow into renewable spaces" and expand the existing energy business, he added. The company's current net debt stands at $6.15 billion.
