SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son in a recent interview while talking about his $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000 said, Alibaba Founder Jack Ma had no business plan and zero revenue. He added that while Ma's business model was wrong, he had leadership skills. Notably, Ma became Asia's richest person in August and is currently the world's 17th richest man.
