The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has penalised 9-companies including Ranbaxy, Dr Reddy's Labs and Cipla, with a penalty of Rs 2500 crore for allegedly selling anti-asthma drug Doxofylline without prior price approval. The move comes in the wake of a recent Supreme Court order that brought the asthma drug being sold between Rs 80-110 per strip under price control.
