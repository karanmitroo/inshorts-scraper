Infosys has asked the West Bengal government to either give a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) status to its proposed software development centre at Rajarhat or repay the money it has given in advance for the land. Infosys was promised the SEZ status for the facility by the previous Left Front government, but the present government is unwilling to do so.
