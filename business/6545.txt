Nobel laureate Amartya Sen on Saturday termed note ban as an unguided "missile" fired "unilaterally" by the government without adhering to the democratic conventions. Sen further said that demonetisation "one fine morning" is of course just a missile where there are reports coming in of hardships and suffering. However, it isn't quite clear where the missile has landed, he added.
