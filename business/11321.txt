India is auctioning 46 oil and gas fields (26 on land, 18 offshore in shallow water and two in deep water), the Oil Ministry said in a newspaper advertisement on Tuesday. This is the first such sale since 2010. This comes after the government, in March, approved a new hydrocarbon policy for exploring energy reserves valued at â‚¹2.61 lakh crore.
