Air India has decided to tighten security for its flights starting from Mumbai and Pune after Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt them. Shiv Sena MPs threatened that unless the ban on MP Ravindra Gaikwad is lifted, they “won’t allow the airlines to fly from Mumbai". Gaikwad has been banned by airlines after he beat up an Air India employee.
