Amidst a boom in its oil industry, the United States on Friday lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports. The ban had been imposed in 1975, following a 1973-74 embargo on oil exports to the US by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countriesâ€™ (OPEC) Arab members, in response to US support of Israel in the Arab-Israeli war.
