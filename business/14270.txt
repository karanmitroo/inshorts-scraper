The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has lodged a complaint with the Commerce Ministry, alleging that e-commerce companies like Flipkart and Amazon are flouting FDI norms by offering discounts to users. CAIT claimed that since these companies are only marketplaces, they don't have ownership of the inventory and hence "cannot offer 'sale' or 'discount' in totality on their portal".
