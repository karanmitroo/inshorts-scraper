Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is planning to raise $500 million through a bond issue or an external commercial borrowing shortly, as per reports. The state-run refiner will use the money to refinance a bridge loan it took to buy stakes in Tass-Yuryakh and Vankor, two oil fields operated by Rosneft OAO, a Russian government-owned energy giant.
