Amid attempts to deal with its diesel emissions scandal, Volkswagen's CEO Matthias MÃ¼ller said that savings will be heavy and won't be done "without pain", a German newspaper reported. "The effects of this crisis...will go to the limits of what we can bear," he added. The German carmaker is facing a $15.3 billion settlement for rigging emission tests since 2009.
