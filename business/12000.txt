A US Federal court has granted final approval to an estimated $20 billion settlement by BP (formerly called British Petroleum) over the firm's 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The settlement was first announced in July 2015. Reportedly, this is the largest environmental settlement in US history and the largest ever civil settlement with a single entity.
