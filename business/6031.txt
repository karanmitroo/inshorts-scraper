After reports of 'churan lable' â‚¹2,000 notes allegedly dispensed from SBI's ATM in Delhi surfaced, the bank claimed that it "suspects the involvement of some miscreants with mischievous intent". The SBI added that any such possibility is "very remote" as their ATM's are equipped with systems that separate any note not conforming to the security features for further manual scrutiny.
