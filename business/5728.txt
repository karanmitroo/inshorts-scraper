Telecom tribunal TDSAT has allowed Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio to continue with its free promotional offer, but asked regulator TRAI to "re-examine" issues relating to its approval granted for the same. TDSAT asked TRAI to inform it about the "findings of the examination" within two weeks. Earlier, incumbent operators criticised TRAI for being a "mute spectator" to Jio's alleged violations.
