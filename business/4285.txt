Former CFO at Citi, Sallie Krawcheck, in a post on LinkedIn said that, "[A]t Citi, I was literally told to 'sit down and shut up'." This happened when Krawcheck was fighting to reimburse client funds for losses in the downturn of 2008. She further noted she doesn't know a single professional woman who doesn't have a story of being "shushed".
