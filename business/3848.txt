Qatar Airways' CEO Akbar Al Baker has been criticised for referring to US airlines' flight attendants as "grandmothers". He said "the average age of my cabin crew is only 26 years". "So there is no need for you to travel on these crap American carriers," he stated, adding, "You know you're always being served by grandmothers on American carriers."
