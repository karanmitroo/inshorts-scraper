Thirty pilots of the low-cost carrier GoAir have resigned within weeks of the CEO Giorgio De Roni's exit. This directly means a 15% reduction in the pilot strength which stands at 200 of the 19-aircraft airline. The reason for leaving of pilots is said to be 'low flying hours' which directly affects the major share of the pay package.
