Surpassing the estimates, Infosys Ltd, India's second largest IT services exporter, on Tuesday reported a 25% increase in quarterly net profit. The net profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Mar-31 was $497 million. Notably, Infosys, which had been continuously losing market share, brought back its founder NR Narayana Murthy in June last year to revive the company's fortune.
