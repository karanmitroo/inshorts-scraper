India on Tuesday imposed an anti-dumping duty on the import of some flat steel products from China and the European Union to curb the influx of cheaper imports and help local producers. The duty will be valid for 5 years. India had earlier imposed an additional 18.95% import tax on certain stainless steel products from China.
