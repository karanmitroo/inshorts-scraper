Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has said the work on the General Electric's (GE) Marhaura diesel locomotive project in Bihar is on track. His comments came after GE said any decision to scrap the project would have a "serious impact on job creation...and cause the government to incur substantial costs". Goyal said the government would abide by its contract with GE.
