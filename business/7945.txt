NCR Corporation India, India's largest ATM maker with over a lakh ATM machines across the country, has said that it will take at least 45 days to physically recalibrate all the machines. During recalibration, the ATMs are physically adjusted to dispense the new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes. Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said recalibration of ATMs will take 2-3 weeks.
