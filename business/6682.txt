Billionaire investor George Soros said that UK PM Theresa May will not remain in power for long as Brexit cripples her government, while US President-elect Donald Trump is a “would-be dictator” who's “going to fail”. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as President, Soros further said Trump was an “impostor and con-man” and was “gearing up for a trade war”.
