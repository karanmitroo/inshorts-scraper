Vodafone India on Thursday said it has decided to increase interconnection points with Reliance Jio Network by three times. Interconnection points enable telecom users to make calls to customers of other networks. Earlier, Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular had also offered interconnection points to Jio, after Reliance accused telecom operators of not releasing sufficient interconnection ports.
