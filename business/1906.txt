Former RBI Governor YV Reddy has said the government's â‚¹2.11 lakh crore recapitalisation plan will only help banks from choking, so they could keep functioning. "It is de-choking, but the structural problem is still there and it needs time to resolve," he said. Talking about the bad loans, he said, "It is not today's problem, the problem has been accumulated."
