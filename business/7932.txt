Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank is cancelling the bonus payments of six former top executives, a German newspaper said on Thursday. The move would target three former CEOs as well as three one-time board members. This comes amid Deutsche undergoing a revamp,  including plans of cutting units and slashing 9,000 jobs in a bid to improve profitability.
