Flyers who exhibit life-threatening behaviour will be barred from flying for over two years, Civil Aviation Secretary RN Choubey announced in the draft rules for the proposed "No-Fly List" today. Passengers will be barred for three months for disruptive behaviour and six months for physically abusive behaviour and sexual harassment. The suspension will apply to domestic carriers.
