A petition has been filed in Supreme Court seeking removal of the current RBI Board of Directors for recommending demonetisation of ₹1,000 and ₹500 notes on the advice of the Centre, reports said. Adding that RBI failed to follow its mandate, the petition alleged that the central bank failed to "prepare a plan, and feasibility and impact assessment of note-banning."
