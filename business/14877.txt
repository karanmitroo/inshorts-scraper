Automobiles manufacturer Hyundai Motor on Saturday announced an increase in the prices of its products across India by up to Rs 30,000. The revised cost will be effective from August 1. However, the price hike will not be applicable on the recently-launched SUV Creta. "The price increase has been necessitated by an increase in input costs," a company official said.
