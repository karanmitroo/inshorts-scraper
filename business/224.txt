Ford has announced its North America division's President, Raj Nair, is departing following an internal investigation that found his behaviour was "inconsistent with the company's code of conduct". Nair, who worked at Ford since 1987, became the President of Ford North America in June 2017. Ford reportedly began the investigation after a recent anonymous complaint from within the company.
