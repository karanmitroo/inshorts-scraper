Nuclear reactor builder Areva said Thursday that it plans to trim labour cost by 18% by 2017 which translate to about 6000 jobs, after bearing financial losses running in billions of euros as France restructure its struggling nuclear energy industry. The partly state-owned company posted a loss of $5.3 billion in 2014 which is more than its entire market value.
