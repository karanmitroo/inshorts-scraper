Mining major Vedanta on Friday reported a 30.4% year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to ₹615 crore for the quarter ended June. Net sales dropped 15% to ₹14,437 crore. The company attributed the decline to a fall in oil and metal prices, a weaker power market and lower zinc volumes, partially offset by ramped-up iron ore, power and aluminium production.
