The state-owned Punjab Energy Development Agency on Sunday invited investors to set up solar power projects of 500 MW, allowing bids between 50-150 MW in a power purchase agreement of 25 years. The state, which gets more than 300 days of sunshine in a year, had reportedly identified 6,000 acres of land to harness its solar potential.
