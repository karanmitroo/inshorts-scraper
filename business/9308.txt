Idea Cellular on Friday said it has more than tripled the interconnection points to new entrant Reliance Jio by offering 1,865 points. This would improve service quality and resolve asymmetry in traffic between the two operators. However, Jio said the proposed capacity is less than 40% of its demand, adding that 4 crore calls are failing between the two operators.
