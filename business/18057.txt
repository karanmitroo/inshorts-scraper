Despite a 10% revenue growth (when measured in Rupee), Tata group's combined turnover has slipped below $100-billion mark, due to rupee fall. Tatas have, however, emerged as the country's first business house to record an annual turnover of more than Rs.5 lakh-crore in 2012-13. Last year, Tatas had become the country's first and only company to cross the $100-billion mark.
