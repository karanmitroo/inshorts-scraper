A hedge fund manager says the British tax collection agency cannot investigate his 2009 finances because of a typo in the letter warning him about the probe. Michael Mabbutt's lawyers said, "Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs have only themselves to blame." Mabbutt's disputed tax amounts to $836,000 (â‚¹5.4 crore), according to an earlier legal ruling in favour of Mabbutt.
