Microsoft has reportedly agreed to invest $100 million in taxi aggregator Uber as part of the company’s latest funding round. If the deal is finalized, Uber will become one of the most richly valued private companies in the world at $51 billion. Uber recently acquired a portion of Microsoft’s mapping-technology assets and extended employment to more than 100 Microsoft employees.
