Microsoft on Monday confirmed that it will close its mobile phone unit in Finland and cut up to 1,350 jobs in the country. Reportedly, Windows-powered smartphones accounted for less than 1% of global smartphone sales in May. The news came months after Microsoft sold Finnish firm Nokia's feature phone business, which it had bought in 2014 for $7.2 billion.
