Reliance Jio on Tuesday said that over 1.6 crore calls are "still failing" every day between Airtel and Jio. This comes after Airtel alleged that Jio itself was responsible for the call failures due to the latter's 'under-preparedness'. â€œIt may be noted that there are no call failures in Jio-to-Jio calls," the new entrant into the telecom sector further added.
