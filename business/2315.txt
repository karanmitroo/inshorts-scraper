NITI Aayog member and Economic Advisory Council Chairman Bibek Debroy on Thursday took a dig at Yashwant Sinha, claiming that what Sinha termed as a "serious emergency" in his critique of the economy, was actually a "minor cold". Debroy added that though were a few problems with the Indian economy following major decisions, there was nothing to be worried about.
