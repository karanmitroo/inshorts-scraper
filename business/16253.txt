As per figures released Thursday, users of iPhones, iPads and iPods spent nearly $500 million on applications during the first week of 2015. This is the highest weekly volume recorded by Apple since it opened its App Store 7 years ago. If sales continue at the same pace, Apple and the app-makers would split up about $25 billion in revenue.
