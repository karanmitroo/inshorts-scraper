State-owned Bank of India will shut 400 ATMs to cut costs as part of a turnaround plan. The bank said it will take a decision on shutting another 300 more ATMs by the end of February. The RBI has put Bank of India under "prompt corrective action" as bad loans soared and return on assets turned negative at the bank.
