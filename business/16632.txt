The govt has modified the selection process for the appointment of heads of state-run banks, which will be held on Nov 13 and 14. Three sub-committees will evaluate each candidate, provide score to them and will submit the score to appointment board. The scores will be then sent to the appointments committee of the cabinet after the finance ministerâ€™s approval.
