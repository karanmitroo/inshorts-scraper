Flipkart has joined hands with the Indian government to train people from semiurban and rural areas, and possibly employ them at the company or its business partners. This is part of Flipkart's attempt to get MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) and traditional artisans to sell their wares on its platform in the next couple of years.
