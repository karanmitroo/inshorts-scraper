The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday said the growth in natural gas demand will slow to an average 1.5% a year globally through 2021, as against an average 2.5% growth in last six years. The global growth will be affected by rising LNG exports by Russia, growing Indian demand, falling production in Europe and US, and slowing Japanese demand.
