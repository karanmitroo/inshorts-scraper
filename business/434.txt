Billionaire promoters of Fortis Healthcare, Malvinder and brother Shivinder Singh, have resigned from the company's board. This comes after the Delhi High Court allowed the enforcement of a â‚¹3,500-crore arbitration award that Japanese drugmaker Daiichi had won. Daiichi argued that the Singh brothers, former Ranbaxy promoters, had concealed important information while selling Ranbaxy in 2008.
