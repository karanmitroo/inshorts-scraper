SBI chief Arundhati Bhattacharya has said that the new ₹2,000 banknote is not a “good mode of exchange” as it constrains people from transacting freely. Further, the cash situation may normalise by February end, as the number of ₹500 notes would exceed ₹2,000 notes by then, the chairperson stated. Moreover, ATMs are being filled up with ₹500 notes, she added.
