Cheng Wei, Co-founder and CEO of Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing has been named Forbes Asia's 2016 Businessman of the Year. Led by the 33-year-old entrepreneur, Didi Chuxing acquired its rival Uber's China business earlier this year. The service, which lets users hail taxis, private cars, limousines and commuter buses, reportedly commands 85% of China's ride-sharing market.
