South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics on Monday posted a record profit of $10 billion for September quarter, a 148% increase from the same quarter last year. The third-quarter sales also surged 29.8% to a quarterly record of $55.5 billion. The results come only two weeks after its CEO Kwon Oh-hyun resigned, saying the firm was facing an "unprecedented crisis".
