Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Sunday said the Modi government must have “consulted some RSS pracharak” before taking the demonetisation decision. "The Finance Secretary, the banking secretary and the Chief Economic Adviser were not consulted, so who was consulted?" Chidambaram had said. He further said the move from demonetisation to ‘remonetisation’ was not “notebandi” but “notebadli”.
