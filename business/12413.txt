Credit rating firm Moody's on Thursday said that the Budget for 2016-17 is "credit negative" for the PSU banks as the allotted capital infusion of ₹25,000 crore falls short of the required ₹1.45 lakh crore. The PSU banks, given their low valuations, will have to turn to the government capital injection at least over the next 18 months, Moody's added.
