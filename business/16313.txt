Brent oil fell to a 5-1/2-year low on Tuesday to hit below $57 per barrel, weighed down by persistent worries about a global supply glut. The concerns over the oil glut offset fears about output disruptions in Libya. Brent for February delivery fell 98 cents to $56.90 as of 1402 IST after hitting $56.74 in the early trade.
