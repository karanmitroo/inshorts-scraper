A reading of Tata Sonsâ€™s articles of association reportedly shows that Tata Trusts, the group's largest shareholder, gave itself special powers in nominating, approving and removing Chairmen in late 2012. Cyrus Mistry took over as Tata Son's Chairman in December 2012. In a decision made by the Board, Mistry was removed from his post on Monday.
