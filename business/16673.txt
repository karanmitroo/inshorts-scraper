Maharashtra has ordered to clear 370-acre of forest land in Gondia (Maharashtra) for the construction of a 1980 megawatt coal-based thermal power plant run by the Adani Group. Gautam Adani identified the area for the project in 2008, but the central govt cleared this project on Aug-28 this year. Following this, the state forest department issued the order on Oct-20.
