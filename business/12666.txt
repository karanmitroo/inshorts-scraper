UK's Competition and Markets Authority has imposed a fine of $54.7 million on pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, over its pay-for-delay deals from 2001 to 2004. The regulator found that Glaxo got paid around $72 million to delay the sale of cheaper, generic version of its anti-depressant Seroxat. However, Glaxo claimed the deals were to "settle costly, complex and uncertain patent disputes".
