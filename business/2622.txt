RBI has said it is using sophisticated Currency Verification and Processing Systems (CVPS) for checking numerical accuracy and genuineness of the currency notes, including the demonetised notes. The clarification came after RBI, in a reply to an RTI application, said 'counting machines' were not being used. "These machines (CVPS) are way superior to the note counting machines," RBI said.
