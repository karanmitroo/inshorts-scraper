Japan has launched the 'Premium Friday' campaign, which urges firms to let employees leave the workplace early, at 3 pm on the last Friday of each month. The initiative aims to encourage workers to spend money on shopping and leisure. Notably, the campaign is part of the government's initiative to check excessive working hours in the country.
