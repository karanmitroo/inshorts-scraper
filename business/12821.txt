HSBC Holdings Plc has imposed a pay and hiring freeze this year as a part of its aim to cut almost $5 billion in costs by 2017. The bank also plans to scale down the number of employees by around 22,000-25,000 (10%). It has already closed down operations in Brazil, and is reviewing its operations in India and the Middle-East.
