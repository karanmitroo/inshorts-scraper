Cryptocurrency Bitcoin's underlying software code was split in two on Tuesday, generating a new clone called 'Bitcoin Cash'. The split was led by a group of mostly China-based Bitcoin miners, who decided to implement a new version that governs the Bitcoin blockchain. The new currency was trading at over $200 (₹12,700) while Bitcoin was trading at around $2,750 (₹1.75 lakh).
