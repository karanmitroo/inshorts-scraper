The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has suspended the licence of budget carrier IndiGo's aviation security training facility for alleged lapses in its examination system. IndiGo would now have to outsource the training programme, which would result in additional cost, as per reports. Notably, it is mandatory for all scheduled airlines to impart aviation security training to its staff.
