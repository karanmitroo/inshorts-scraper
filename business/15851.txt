Facing a multi-nation probe for allegedly abetting tax evasion, HSBC Monday said it has been served summons by the Indian tax department. The bank is also fearing "significant" amounts of fines, penalties and/or forfeitures imposed on it. HSBC is being probed by tax authorities in many other countries as well with regard to alleged irregularities by its Swiss banking unit.
