Iran will reportedly reduce the time it gives to Indian refiners to pay for oil they buy from it from 90 to 60 days as a retaliatory measure to India's decision to reduce Iranian oil imports. Iran will also lower discounts on crude oil shipping to 60% from 80%. The measures will make Iranian purchases costlier and less competitive.
