Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that he will push for the passing of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy bill in the Parliament in the next three days before the winter session ends on Wednesday. The proposed bill will reportedly create a consolidated framework for bankrupt companies to shut down their business and methods for its investors to exit.
