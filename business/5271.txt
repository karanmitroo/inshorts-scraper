United Arab Emirates-based firm Alpha Paint has issued a termination order against an Indian employee for sending sexually explicit and abusive messages to journalist Rana Ayyub on Facebook. The firm apologised to Ayyub, after a probe against the man proved that the allegations were true. The man's visa was cancelled and a deportation order has also been issued.
