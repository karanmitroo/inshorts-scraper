The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will share FDI-related data with the country's intelligence agencies, Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), to check the black money entering India. The FDI to India comes either through the automatic route, or through government body Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) which processes FDI-proposals, both of which get recorded by RBI.
