Telecom regulator TRAI has refused to reconsider its 2016 order imposing fines adding up to â‚¹3,050 crore on telcos Airtel, Idea, and Vodafone. TRAI cited wilful violation of quality of service norms by the telcos, possibly with the "ulterior motive to stifle competition". It stated that incumbents deliberately delayed in providing sufficient interconnection points as requested by Reliance Jio.
