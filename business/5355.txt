Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox secured EU antitrust approval on Friday for its $14.5 billion takeover of pay-TV group Sky. The European Commission said the deal did not raise any competition concerns as the companies are active in different markets in Europe. However, regulators are still examining whether the deal would result in Murdoch controlling too much of UK's media.
