Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal on Wednesday came in support of its rival Snapdeal over the ongoing controversy surrounding its ambassador Aamir Khan's remarks on intolerance. "Brands don't buy into brand ambassadors personal opinions", Bansal said. Further, distancing itself from the controversy, Snapdeal said the company plays no role in comments made by the actor in his personal capacity.
