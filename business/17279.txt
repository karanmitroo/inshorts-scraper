As part of an exercise intended to improve efficiency, ICICI Bank - the country's largest private sector lender by assets - has let go 1,200 of its staffers, sources said. "Every organisation should periodically renew itself and let go of people periodically. Otherwise, the organisation will decay," said K Ramkumar, executive director at ICICI Bank.
