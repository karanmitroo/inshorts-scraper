American health insurance company Cigna on Tuesday ended $48 billion worth of merger with the larger insurer Anthem and sued it for $13 billion. Cigna accused Anthem of "fatally compromising the path for regulatory approval of the transaction". The merger was blocked by a federal judge last week, however, Anthem said it would seek an expedited appeal of the ruling.
