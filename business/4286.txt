A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free 'Choco' spread by supermarket chain Delhaize were illegal. The case by Nutella manufacturer Ferrero argued that Delhaize's campaign unfairly damaged its iconic brand. Delhaize has now been ordered not to repeat claims about its spread being better for the planet or health.
