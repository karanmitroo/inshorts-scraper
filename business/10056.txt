The first Reserve Bank of India Governor, Sir Osborne Smith, is the only apex bank Governor who did not sign any Indian currency notes. The notes signed by Smith could not be put in circulation as the then King of England, Edward VII, had just stepped down. Notably, Urjit Patel was appointed the 24th Governer of the RBI on Saturday.
