After United Airlines' shares fell by nearly $1 billion on Tuesday, United CEO Oscar Munoz issued a public apology to the passenger physically dragged off a flight. Munoz said, "No one should ever be mistreated this way," offering his "deepest apologies" and calling the incident "truly horrific". In a previous statement, Munoz had publicly apologised only for re-accommodating passengers.
