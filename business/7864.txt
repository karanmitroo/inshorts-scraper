Newspaper publishers in Imphal, Manipur have decided to stop publications after the government’s move to scrap high-value currencies. “We’re compelled to take the step in view of the non-acceptance of the ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes and also non-availability of currency notes of smaller denomination,” officials said. "We also apologise for the public inconvenience in this regard,” they added.
