The Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to redefine micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), based on their annual turnover. The move, which replaces earlier classification based on investment in plant and machinery, is expected to improve ease of doing business. Notably, the government announced a cut in the tax rate for MSMEs from 30% to 25% in the Budget.
