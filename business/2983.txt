Former Infosys board member, Omkar Goswami, in an open letter to Co-founder Narayana Murthy said, "Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal." Goswami wrote that Murthy's actions created a crisis that forced Sikka's exit. Stating that "enough is enough", he further asked Murthy not to "mortally wound" Infosys by persisting in his actions.
