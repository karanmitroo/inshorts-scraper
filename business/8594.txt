Brazilian prosecutors have filed homicide charges against 21 people, including current and former top executives of mining majors Vale and BHP Billiton over a mining dam collapse a year ago. According to the prosecutors, the companies were aware of a risk of collapse but ignored it. Notably, the November 2015 collapse killed 19 people and polluted miles of Brazil's waterways.
