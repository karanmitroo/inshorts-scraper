Nestlé India Chairman Suresh Narayanan on Monday said the company met a loss of ₹100 crore due to demonetisation. "In November we took a hit and December was much better. January has been even better and February is also running fairly good,” Narayanan said. Overall, the sector will take another six months to overcome demonetisation's impact, he added.
