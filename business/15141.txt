Suzuki Motor Corporation has signed a deal with Malaysia's carmaker Proton for the assembly and sale of an entry-level car in the latter's domestic market. Suzuki will export completely knocked down (CKD) kits of cars, which will later be assembled and sold by Proton. The move is expected to boost export of Suzuki's Indian subsidiary, Maruti Suzuki.
