Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the states are not in favour of including petrol and diesel under GST at the moment. Petroleum products currently attract duties like central excise and Value-Added Tax (VAT). Jaitley added that rationalisation of tax rates will continue as revenues rise and eventually the 28% tax slab would be restricted to demerit and luxury goods.
