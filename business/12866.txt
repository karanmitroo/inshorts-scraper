The Indian rupee slipped to a fresh 29-month low of 68.20 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, after hitting 68.05 the day before. Analysts attributed the fall to strong month-end demand for the US dollar from importers and banks. Further, forex dealers said that a lower opening in the domestic equity market kept pressure on the rupee.
