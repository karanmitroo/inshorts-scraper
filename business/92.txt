The Union Cabinet has cleared a bill allowing authorities to confiscate all assets of economic defaulters who flee the country, even if they aren't convicted. It provides for selling the assets to recover the defaulters' dues. Announced in Budget 2017, the bill was reportedly hastened after PNB scam accused Nirav Modi fled the country and refused to cooperate with investigations.
