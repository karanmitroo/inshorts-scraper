Royal Bank of Scotland needs to cut 15,000 jobs in a bid to cut over $1 billion (₹6,700 crore) of costs by eliminating jobs and closing branches, according to reports. This comes as the bank is expected to post its ninth year of consecutive losses. Notably, the bank has lost $63 billion (₹4 lakh crore) since the 2008 financial crisis.
