India's oil consumption in August shrank 6.1%, most since April 2003, as floods affected several parts of the country curbing demand for petrol and diesel. India, the world's fastest growing oil consumer, used 15.75 million tonnes of fuels in August, according to the Oil Ministry. Demand for diesel, which accounts for nearly 40% of total oil product sales, fell 3.7%.
