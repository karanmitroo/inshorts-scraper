Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Friday said hotels and restaurants should not decide the amount of service charge and that it should be left to the customer's discretion. The government has framed new guidelines on service charge, which make it totally voluntary, he added. Paswan further said these guidelines are being sent to the states for necessary action.
