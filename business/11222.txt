China's central bank on Monday set the daily Yuan-fixing rate against the US Dollar at 6.5784, the lowest level since February 2011. This follows US Federal Reserveâ€‹ Chairman Janet Yellen's comments on Friday that a rate hike in the coming months "would be appropriate". The Yuan is allowed to trade 2% on either side of the daily fix.
