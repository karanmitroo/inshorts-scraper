A senior Motorola official said on Wednesday that Motorola would continue its exclusive tie-up with e-commerce giant Flipkart. He further added that the company has no plans to sell its mobile phones through other e-commerce portals like Snapdeal or Amazon or foraying into a brick and mortar model. Motorola's rival Xiaomi had started selling its phones via physical outlets also.
