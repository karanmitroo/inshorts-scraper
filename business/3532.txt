E-commerce giant Amazon on Thursday reported a 77% fall in quarterly income to $197 million for the quarter ended June 30 from $857 million a year ago. The plunge was attributed to the company's investment in video content and fast-growing economies such as India. However, Amazon's revenue grew by 25% to $38 billion in the same period.
