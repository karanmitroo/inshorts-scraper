The Civil Aviation Ministry has reportedly dropped the proposal of auctioning unused bilateral air traffic rights on international routes. Further, the existing rule of domestic airlines having a five-year experience and 20 aircraft to fly on international routes is proposed to be replaced with only the 20 aircraft requirement and a minimum of 20% aircraft being deployed domestically.
