Billionaire investor Warren Buffett made $32.2 million (over â‚¹219 crore) a day on average, gaining as much as $11.8 billion in 2016. This made him the biggest gainer among the world's wealthiest people in 2016. The gain came after his firm Berkshire Hathaway's holdings surged following Donald Trump's victory, post which Buffett reclaimed his spot as the world's second-richest person.
