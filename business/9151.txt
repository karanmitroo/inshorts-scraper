The Indian Railways on Thursday introduced a sub-quota of 33% for women in the allotment of each of the reserved catering units to ensure women's participation and to extend economic empowerment to them. This will ensure allotment of a minimum 8% stalls to women at major stations and a minimum 17% at lesser crowded stations.
