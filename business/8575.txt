Talks on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between EU and Canada have ended, after Canada's trade minister Chrystia Freeland walked out midway. Freeland announced she is ending the talks claiming that EU's parliament has been blocking the deal. Notably, CETA would eliminate tariffs on most goods trading between the EU and Canada.
