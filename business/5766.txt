Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has launched a new feature that lets users digitally suspend their own SIM cards in case they lose their phones or Jio SIMs. The feature, available on the companyâ€™s official website, also offers a 'resume' option, choosing which will restart the services. As of now, Jio is the only operator offering this feature to its users.
