The RBI on Thursday amended the Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS) to permit proprietorship and partnership firms to make gold deposits under a joint deposit account in the name of the depositors. Under the GMS that was introduced last year, resident Indians and trusts registered under the SEBI can earn interests on the gold deposited in the banks.
