Laying the foundation for the offline space, online mobile wallet platform Paytm entered into a partnership with some Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) including Cafe Coffee Day and Domino's. Through a mobile wallet, users are able to store money digitally and use it for transactions, giving them a secure payment platform. The offline service will be available by mid of June.
