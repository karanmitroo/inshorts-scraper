Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry was on Tuesday removed as the Director of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) after 93.11% shareholders voted in favour of Mistry's removal. However, 43% of institutional investors and 78% of retail investors voted against Mistry's removal. As Tata Sons has a 73% stake in TCS, these minority investor votes could not impact Mistry's removal.
