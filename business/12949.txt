ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of ONGC, has been offered three more oil and gas blocks by Sudan for exploration and production. Sudan has also invited Indian firms to set up a coastal refinery. The offer was made by Sudan's Oil Minister Mohamed Zayed Awad. ONGC Videsh already controls 25% stake in Sudan's Greater Nile Oil Project.
