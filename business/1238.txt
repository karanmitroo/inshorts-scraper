Several high-profile CEOs left their jobs in 2017, including General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, who ended his nearly 16-year tenure at the conglomerate that he reshaped after the financial crisis. The year also saw the ouster of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and exit of Ford Motor's Mark Fields. Further, Irene Rosenfeld stepped down as CEO of Cadbury products maker Mondelez.
