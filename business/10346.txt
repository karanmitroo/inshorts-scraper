Pizza restaurant chain Dominos India is no longer a 'Unicorn' company after its shares plummeted from ₹2,000 in Aug'15 to ₹1,000 in June'16, resulting in a valuation of under $1 billion. According to a study, customers looking for more healthy options and the rise of other Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) have contributed to the fall in Dominos' valuation.
