Beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya has said he was being made a “poster boy" of loan defaulters and denied rights, which even the 'most dreaded criminals get to avail' under the law. Mallya's lawyer further pointed out that banks themselves had non-performing assets worth over ₹7 lakh crore. Notably, Mallya owes over ₹9,000 crore to the banks.
