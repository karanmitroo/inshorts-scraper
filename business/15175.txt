The International Monetary fund (IMF) on Friday announced putting its decision on raising emerging countriesâ€™ voting rights on hold for three months. The IMF had agreed, among other things, in 2010 to give more voting power to countries like China and India, but the decision has been stalled reportedly as the US Congress is still to pass necessary funding changes.
