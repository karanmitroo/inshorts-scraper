RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty  said banks have written off 1 lakh crore in advances in the past 13 years and criticized the lenders because around 95% of these write-offs were for large borrowers.  He was critical of the "technical write-off" system and also asked the bankers to be economical with rearrangements, if not abolish the system as a whole.
