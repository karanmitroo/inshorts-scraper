E-commerce giant Flipkart is reportedly closing down its payment gateway PayZippy (launched in July 2013) as the service failed to perform well. According to reports, Flipkart has made "strategic investment" in ngpay, which pioneers in mobile payments in India. Though the company phases out PayZippy, it says, nothing will change for its existing customers.
