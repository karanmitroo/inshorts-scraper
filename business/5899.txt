HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank will now charge a minimum ₹150 per transaction for cash deposits and withdrawals beyond four free transactions monthly. The banks will calculate the fee at a rate of ₹5 per ₹1,000 transacted or ₹150, whichever is higher, after the free transactions. Further, these charges are for transactions in branches and not ATMs.
