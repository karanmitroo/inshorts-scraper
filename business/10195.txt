The largest German airline Lufthansa and Germany's pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit on Saturday said that they have 'broken off' talks over pay and early retirement terms. Lufthansa has been in talks with the pilots union for four years in a long-running dispute that has resulted in over a dozen strikes, which have reportedly cost the airlines around $560 million.
