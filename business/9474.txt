US presidential nominee Donald Trump said that if elected President, he would label China as a "currency manipulator" and would apply "countervailing duties" until China ceased illegal activities. This comes after reports that said the US has a $500 billion trade deficit with China. Trump claimed that he will set a 4% annual growth target, and create 25 million jobs.
