UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that company bosses who "line their own pockets" while failing to protect employees' pension schemes will be hit with huge fines. May's statement comes after UK construction firm Carillion collapsed with a pension deficit of up to $1.2 billion. Around 28,000 members relying on the company's 13 pension schemes have been affected.
