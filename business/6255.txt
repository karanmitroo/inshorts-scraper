Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande has confirmed that the Centre has slapped notices on Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio and Paytm for using Prime Minister Narendra Modi's photograph in their advertisements. Reliance Jio, through its ads, had dedicated the Jio 4G service to the Modi government's Digital India project. Paytm had released ads after the demonetisation decision was announced.
