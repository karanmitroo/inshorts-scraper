The country’s external debt as on December 31, 2013, stood at $426 billion, an increase of 5.2%, or $21.1 billion, over end-March 2013, the finance ministry said on Monday. This led to an external debt to GDP ratio of 23.3% at end-December 2013. “The rise in external debt was due to long-term debt particularly NRI deposits,” the release stated.
