Former Allahabad Bank Director Dinesh Dubey has said that he had opposed granting a ₹50-crore loan to Gitanjali Gems owned by Mehul Choksi unless he repaid an earlier loan of ₹1,500 crore. He had also urged to take preventive action against companies linked to Choksi's firm. Dubey added that he had resigned after being pressurised to approve the loan.
