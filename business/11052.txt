Petroleum major BP has sold its Norwegian oil fields to billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke for $1.3 billion. The deal comes as the worldâ€™s largest oil companies try new structures to adapt to lower oil prices. Major producers are reportedly seeking to sharpen their portfolios, cut spending and reduce debt by offloading decades-old fields, with less buyers available in the market.
