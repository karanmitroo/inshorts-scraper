Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi on Tuesday said the 12% GST on sanitary napkins benefits small indigenous manufacturers as businesses with less than â‚¹20-lakh turnover are not taxed. Stating that GST on the product blocks large MNCs from laterally expanding, Gandhi said the taxation policy allows NGOs and women groups to establish businesses by selling sanitary napkins.
