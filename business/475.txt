The Mahindra Group and the Piramal Group have expressed interest in buying Sahara Group's Aamby Valley resort town, according to the official liquidator. The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the sale of the property in parcels after lawyers said selling the property as a whole was difficult. This comes after Sahara failed to deposit dues to refund its investors.
