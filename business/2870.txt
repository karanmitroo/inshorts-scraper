Infosys Co-founder NR Narayana Murthy on Tuesday defended his role in the dispute with Infosys board, saying his actions were in the interest of shareholders. Murthy added he is confident the management would rally behind Nandan Nilekani, the new Non-Executive Chairman. Earlier, Infosys board had blamed Murthy's 'continuous assault' as the primary reason for Vishal Sikka's resignation as CEO.
