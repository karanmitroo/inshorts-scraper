The government on Thursday imposed anti-dumping duty on TMT steel bars from China to reduce overseas purchases of the alloy and shield local mills. The anti-dumping duty has been levied for six months, reports said. Steelmakers such as SAIL, JSW Steel and Tata Steel had reportedly lobbied to prevent cheap overseas purchases that were squeezing their margins.
