The RBI on Monday released a report on financial inclusion in which it suggested to link all credit accounts to a unique biometric identifier, such as Aadhar, to identify multiple credit-accounts and mitigate indebtedness by multiple borrowings. The panel also proposed phasing out of short-term interest rate subvention scheme, and replacing it by crop insurance schemes for small farmers.
