UK supermarket chain Waitrose has announced it will cut the price of women's sanitary products and pay 5% "tampon tax" on behalf of its customers. "[We] are confident it will make a difference to our customers," a Waitrose executive said. Notably, a similar move was announced by supermarket chain Tesco last week to cut prices of nearly 100 such products.
