HSBC's technical analysis head Murray Gunn has issued a red alert for US stocks stating that the possibility of a "severe" market crash is now "very high". His statement followed "aggressive" sell offs in the US market earlier. Notably, the recent stock market moves seem similar to those before 1987’s ‘Black Monday’, the biggest one-day crash in history, analysts said.
