Idea Cellular CEO Himanshu Kapania has said TRAI's decision to cut Interconnection Usage Charge (IUC) will eliminate all telecom technologies other than 4G. Kapania said the government has to decide if it wants only forward-looking technologies or a coexistence of 2G with 4G. Kapania added voice calls' prices have come down by 50% in a year, which are below cost.
