Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on Tuesday launched ‘SmartShift’, an online portal for connecting transporters and cargo owners. The platform “can bring significant efficiencies” in India’s "fragmented" goods transport industry, said M&M Group President Anish Shah. Inefficiencies in logistics infrastructure cost the Indian economy an extra $45 billion (4.3% of GDP) annually, according to McKinsey.
