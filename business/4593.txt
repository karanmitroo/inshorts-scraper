After Shashi Tharoor filed a defamation suit against Arnab Goswami, the Delhi High Court has issued a notice to Goswami and Republic TV. "Bring down the rhetoric. You can put out your story, you can put out the facts. You cannot call him names," the court told Goswami. Notably, Republic claimed Tharoor was linked to his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death.
