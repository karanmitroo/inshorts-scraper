Lufthansa-owned low-cost airline Eurowings has mocked Ryanair after it cancelled 2,100 flights, with a full-page German newspaper advert depicting Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary under the headline "O'Deary!" Eurowings invited affected customers to travel with the airline, and asked them on Twitter and Facebook if their bookings had been a "Ryanfall," a play on words relating to German for "flop."
