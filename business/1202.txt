Cryptocurrency Litecoin's founder Charlie Lee has said in a Reddit post that he sold and donated all of his holdings in Litecoin. He said the disposal is aimed at preventing a "conflict of interest" when he makes comments on social media that could influence Litecoin's price. Notably, Litecoin has surged over 7,800% this year to over $340.
