American Airlines has slammed Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker for his comments on US airlines, saying his remarks were "sexist and ageist". The dispute was triggered after Al Baker said the average age of his cabin crew is 26 and that "you are always being served by grandmothers on American carriers". The remarks were "incredibly offensive", American Airlines stated.
