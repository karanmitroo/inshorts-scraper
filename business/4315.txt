Tourists have complained against Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler for parking his mega-yacht in front of the Statue of Liberty for over two months. Although the yacht is parked legally, locals say boats normally move after two days. The 370-feet Le Grand Bleu is the length of a football field and is among world's largest private yachts.
