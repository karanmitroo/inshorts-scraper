Aviva Investors is opposing billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd’s $2.3 billion takeover of Cairn India claiming that the deal does not give value to minority shareholders. The company holds 4.3% stake in the Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy, owner of the India branch of the oil producer. Aviva sees a risk of misallocation of Cairn’s capital to pay off its huge debt.
