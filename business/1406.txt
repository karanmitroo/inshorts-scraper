Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Friday said the "fourth industrial revolution is upon us" and its foundation is Artificial Intelligence (AI), data connectivity and computing. Those who don't adapt to technology will become irrelevant, he added. "We are in the age of super intelligence. What manufacturing was for China, super intelligence can be for India," he further said.
