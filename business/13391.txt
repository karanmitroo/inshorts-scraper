Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said that India is “well prepared” to handle the impact of the US Federal Reserve’s decision to hike its interest rate the previous night. "End of uncertainty and accommodative outlook for future will help policy makers in emerging economies… US Fed confidence on recovery is good news for our exports," Das added.
