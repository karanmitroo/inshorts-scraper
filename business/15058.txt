Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis on Thursday suggested that the government may resign if it doesn't receive a favourable verdict in Sunday's referendum. He added that he expected an agreement with Europe and the 'No' campaign to win. Varoufakis also said he wouldn't sign any deal without reference to restructuring of debt, adding "I prefer to cut my arm off."
