A rare 1931 pencil portrait of Mahatma Gandhi and collection of his handwritten letters, that were auctioned, have been bought by Cyrus Poonawalla, popularly known as the 'vaccine billionaire'. Poonawalla, who founded the Serum Institute of India in 1966, bought the works for £32,500 (₹27 lakh). Poonawalla said he wanted to bring the historic and rare works back to India.
