Reliance Communications and Aircel have reportedly begun talks to merge their wireless operations. The combined entity will be the country's second-biggest mobile phone operator by subscriber numbers overtaking Vodafone. Reliance has also entered into a 90-day exclusivity period for the talks. However, the merger will reportedly exclude the tower and optical fibre assets of Reliance.
