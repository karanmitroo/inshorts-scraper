Axis Bank, Indiaâ€™s third-largest private sector bank, has appointed search firm Egon Zehnder to look for a new CEO to succeed Shikha Sharma, who is set to step down next year, reports said. Axis is seeking to choose the new CEO by December. However, it's possible that Sharma, who was named the bank's head in 2009, might get an extension.
