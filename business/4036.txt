British pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline has entered into a $43 million (over â‚¹277 crore) deal with Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven drug discovery startup Exscientia. The AI system could deliver drug candidates in roughly one-quarter of the time and at one-quarter of the cost of traditional approaches, said Exscientia's CEO. Notably, Exscientia also struck a deal with drugmaker Sanofi in May.
