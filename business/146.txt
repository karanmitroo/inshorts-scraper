Iran is planning to launch its own national cryptocurrency with officials saying that a test model for a "cloud-based digital currency" is being developed for submission to the Iranian banking system. As per reports, the cryptocurrency would help Iran evade the potential US sanctions. This comes after Venezuela, also hit by US sanctions, launched its own oil-backed cryptocurrency 'Petro'.
