Tata Motors CEO Guenter Butschek took home over ₹22.55 crore last fiscal, while other key officials saw their remunerations cut amid mounting losses. Executive Director Satish Borwankar, who has taken over as COO, saw a cut of 12% to ₹2.14 crore. However, most independent directors, except Nusli Wadia, who was removed from the board last year, saw their remunerations grow.
