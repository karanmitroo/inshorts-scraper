Jio Payments Bank, a 70:30 joint venture between Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries and SBI, will begin operations in December, according to reports. It had initially planned its launch to coincide with the delivery of its JioPhone in October. Reportedly, the delay is because RBI had asked the bank to demonstrate its capabilities to ensure it's ready for a glitch-free launch.
