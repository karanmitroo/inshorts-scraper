Simon Property Group, one of the largest US mall operators, is suing Starbucks over its plans to close 78 Teavana stores in the group's centres. It has filed a lawsuit against Starbucks claiming the coffee giant hadn't fulfilled its lease obligations. Starbucks earlier said it will close all 379 Teavana stores because the mall-based chain's "underperformance" was likely to continue.
