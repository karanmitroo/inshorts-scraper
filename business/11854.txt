The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has decided against scrapping the Pensions Act, 1871 which exempts pension from being attached by a court or confiscated. Earlier, the DoPT had asked the Law Ministry to include the 145-year-old law in the repealing bill so that it can be removed. Currently, the bill is pending in the Rajya Sabha.
