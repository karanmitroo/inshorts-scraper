India's richest banker Uday Kotak has said allowing 100% foreign investment in Indian banks is "not a great idea". "We should be getting foreign investment as a strength and not as a weakness," he added. The government reportedly plans to raise foreign investment limit in private sector banks to 100% from 74%, and to 49% from 20% in state-run banks.
