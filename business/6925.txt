Donald Trump's new Washington hotel owes electricians, wood workers and a plumbing and heating business more than $5 million (over â‚¹34 crore) for unpaid labour, according to liens filed against the property. Trump has acknowledged he hasn't always paid all his bills, saying it's a negotiating tactic when work is subpar. Trump's companies have earlier been sued over unpaid work.
