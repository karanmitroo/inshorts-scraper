Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) Director General Vishnu Mathur on Friday dismissed the NGT’s ban on registration of any more diesel vehicles in Delhi as a “ridiculous… knee-jerk reaction”. “[O]nly 2.5% of pollution is accounted by cars, both petrol and diesel cars. So... it is not going to help reduce pollution in Delhi,” Mathur said.
