The Orissa High Court on Friday allowed Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) to move iron ore stockpiles from Odisha's Sarda Mines. JSPL had been using ores from the mine until two years ago when the Supreme Court ordered the closure of nearly half of Odisha's mines over non-renewal of long-term leases. Following the announcement, JSPLâ€™s shares rose by over 10%.
