Hanergy Thin Film Power Group's Founder and former Chairman, Li Hejun, has been barred from serving as a director on the board of any company in Hong Kong for eight years. This came after a Hong Kong court ruled he was involved in misconduct related to running of the company. Four other directors were also issued bans of varying lengths.
