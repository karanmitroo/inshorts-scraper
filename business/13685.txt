Taxi aggregator Ola said on Friday that it had entered into a licensing deal with MapMyIndia and would begin using its digital maps and location data. Ola said the partnership would provide it with consistent map updates and help improve 'estimated time' efficiency for drivers and prospective passengers. Ola will also continue to use Apple Inc and Google Inc maps.
