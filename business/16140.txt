Pradip Burman, one of the Dabur India promoters, whose name was in the list given by the Centre to the Supreme Court on the black money issue, was on Tuesday denied permission to go abroad. The court dismissed Burmanâ€™s application seeking permission to go to Hong Kong for family function, saying there was no justifiable ground for it.
