RBI Deputy Governor SS Mundra has said banks that do not adapt in the age of financial technology companies would “run the risk of becoming history”. "The age of fin-techs is here and for the incumbent banks there is no time to lose," Mundra stated. He further asked banks not to treat fin-tech companies as 'threats' but as an 'opportunity'.
