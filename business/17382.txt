In a setback to DLF, the competition appellate tribunal Monday upheld the CCI (Competition Commission of India) order imposing Rs 630 crore penalty on the realty major for unfair business practices. In August 2011, the CCI had found DLF violating fair trade norms and imposed the fine on it, following a complaint by a Belaire Owners' Association in Gurgaon.
