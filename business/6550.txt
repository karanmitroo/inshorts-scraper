Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley has warned that the slump in the value of pound since Brexit could cost the automaker around $600 million (over â‚¹4,000 crore) this year. Ford makes 20 lakh engines in the UK and employs 15,000 staff, Farley said. In this regard, the company will have a lot of work to do in 2017, he added.
