UK tobacco company British American Tobacco (BAT) is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over allegations about involvement in bribery and corruption in Africa. BAT has denied allegations of a whistleblower who handed over multiple documents to SFO. However, BAT has said it is cooperating with UK authorities as campaigners are now urging US government to act.
