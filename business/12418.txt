Tata Motors on Tuesday increased prices of its passenger vehicles by ₹2,000-35,000 with immediate effect. The step has been taken to offset the impact of the 1-4% infrastructure cess proposed for different categories of cars in the Budget 2016-17. Further, Hyundai Motor India and Honda Cars are also planning price hikes of up to ₹80,000.
