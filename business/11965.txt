Global trade declined 13% in 2015 to $16.5 trillion in value terms, due to “strong fluctuations in commodity prices and exchange rates”, the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday said. In volume terms, global trade remained flat in 2015 and is expected to grow by 2.8% this year and 3.6% in 2017, subject to several downside risks, the WTO added.
