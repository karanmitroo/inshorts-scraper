Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the national food regulator, on Friday asked all the states and Union Territories to appoint trained 'food safety supervisors' for all food businesses with 25 or more people handling food. These supervisors would be responsible for ensuring that food quality is maintained, however, legally the owners would be responsible for lapses.
