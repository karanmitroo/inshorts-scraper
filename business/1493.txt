Mitsubishi Materials has admitted that its three subsidiaries manipulated inspection data of parts used in aircraft, automobiles and industrial machinery. Data was falsified for around 270 million units sold between April 2015 and September 2017 to a total of 229 customers. Following this, the company's shares plunged as much as 11% during intraday trade in Tokyo.
