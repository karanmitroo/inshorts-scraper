A French court on Friday ordered German safety body TUV to pay $64 million (over â‚¹435 crore) to compensate 20,000 women who received defective breast implants. TUV had certified France-based Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which made implants using substandard industrial-grade silicone. PIP implants were found to have double the rupture rate of others, with an added risk of medical problems.
