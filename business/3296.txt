The government on Tuesday said that the new ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes have 'single unique dimension'. The size of new ₹500 note is 66mm x 150mm and that of ₹2,000 note is 66mm x 166mm. This came in response to allegations by opposition parties that the new notes have different sizes, calling it the "biggest scam of this century".
