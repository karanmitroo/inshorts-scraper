After failing to find an amicable solution with the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), PSU bank unions have decided to go on a day-long strike on Wednesday, to press for wage revision and other demands. Although, IBA had offered a 5% raise but the Unions were not satisfied with it. The wage revision of bank employees is due from Nov 2012.
