US President-elect Donald Trump said he was recently offered $2 billion (over ₹13,600 crore) to make a deal in Dubai with a property developer but he turned it down. "I didn’t have to turn it down," he stated. “I have no conflict of interest situation because I’m President,” Trump said, adding, “But I don’t want to take advantage of something.”
