Alphabet replaced Google as a publicly traded company after the US markets closed on Friday. The company would start trading on the Nasdaq on Monday. Google’s Class A shares and Class C shares would convert into an equal number of respective Alphabet shares. The structural overhaul was announced in August to separate Google’s core business from its other ventures.
