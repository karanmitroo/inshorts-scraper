The Government is keeping a "close watch" on the developments relating to the Tata-Mistry case, but does not want to "interfere" at present, MoS for Corporate Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal has said. He added that the Centre hasn't received any representation from regulatory authorities like SEBI and would "take note" when asked to look into the matter in the future.
