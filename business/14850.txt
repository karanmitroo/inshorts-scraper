The Hong Kong central bank on Friday imposed a penalty of $1 million (Hong Kong dollar 7.5 million) on the State Bank of India’s Hong Kong branch for allegedly violating the local anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing laws. This is the first such action since the Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance came into effect in 2012.
