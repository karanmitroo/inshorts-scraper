SpicJet may see a change of guard if investors, currently evaluating the cash-strapped budget carrier, are convinced about investing Rs 1,200 crore and buying considerable stake in it. The potential acquirers may take 4-6 weeks to complete the evaluation. Sources said if the investment goes through, the control of SpiceJet may shift from Kalanithi Maran's hands to the potential investors.
