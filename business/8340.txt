Ratan Tata, Tata Sons interim Chairman, has reportedly written a letter to employees reassuring them about the future of the group and its companies. Further, he said that the decision to change the leadership at Tata Sons was a well-deliberated one taken to maintain the Tata culture. The letter comes a week after Tata chairman Cyrus Mistry was sacked.
