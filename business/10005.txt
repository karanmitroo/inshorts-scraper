The National Green Tribunal on Tuesday imposed a ₹100 crore and ₹5 crore fine on Qatar-based Delta Navigation and Adani Enterprises respectively, over environmental damages in a 2011 oil spill case. The Delta-owned ship, carrying fuel and coal for the latter, had sunk off the Mumbai coast, following which the oil had spread about seven nautical miles around the vessel.
