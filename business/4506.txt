Meat processor Beef Products Inc has claimed that it was defamed by media firm ABC News, which characterised its beef product as "pink slime". The firm, which sued ABC for $5.7 billion (â‚¹37,000 crore), argued that it ruined its reputation in 2012, almost putting it out of business. Notably, while reporting, ABC's journalist used the term "pink slime" 137 times.
