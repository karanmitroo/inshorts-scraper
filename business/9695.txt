China's currency 'yuan' dropped by 0.16% on Tuesday to hit its lowest level in nearly six years at 6.68 against the dollar. This comes amid speculations that the People’s Bank of China will ease back on currency control. Notably, the yuan has dropped 0.6% versus the dollar since August on concerns over the nation’s economic health.
