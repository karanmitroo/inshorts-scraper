The Union Urban Development Ministry on Wednesday finalised the rules to make the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act operational in Delhi. The law will not only protect new homebuyers from unscrupulous developers but safeguard the interest of allottees of the ongoing projects. â€œWe will notify the rules for Delhi before November 27," said an official from the ministry.
