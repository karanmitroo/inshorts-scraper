Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has said the chain will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. The hiring will apply to stores worldwide but begin in America, where Starbucks will focus on recruiting immigrants who have served with American troops as support personnel. This comes after US President Donald Trumpâ€™s travel bans that apply to 7 Muslim-majority nations.
