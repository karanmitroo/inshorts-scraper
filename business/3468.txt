HDFC Standard Life Insurance and Max Life Insurance have called off their proposed merger after failing to win regulatory approval for a union that would've created an insurance giant with â‚¹1.1 lakh crore in assets. The potential merger would have created India's largest private sector life insurer, surpassing ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, and would've been second only to state-run LIC.
