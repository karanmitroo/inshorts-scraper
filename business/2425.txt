Tobias Reiss-Schmidt, President and CEO of watchmaker Timex, has said Indian consumers prefer watches with a lot of needles, multiple features, complicated big dials and different colours. He said Indians are different on design front compared to US and Western Europe, where the trend is for minimalist design. He added Timex will launch its e-commerce platform in India this month.
