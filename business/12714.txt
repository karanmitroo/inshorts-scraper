Under a draft European Union (EU) legislation, multinational companies (MNCs) like Google and Facebook will need to make their earnings and tax bills in Europe public. This will make tax arrangements between EU governments and MNCs open to public scrutiny. The proposal is scheduled to be tabled in April and will need approval from all 28 EU governments.
