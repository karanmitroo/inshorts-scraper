The Tata- Singapore Airlines joint venture airline, Vistaraâ€™s launch may get delayed by a couple of months, due to regulatory approvals, officials said Wednesday. The proposed carrier would have to complete various formalities before the aviation regulator, DGCA, gives it the flying licence or the Scheduled Operator's Permit. The airline had earlier announced plans to start operations in October.
