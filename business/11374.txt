Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the World Bank (WB) needs to have a larger capital base and expand its role in social sector projects including healthcare and education. Further, India's strong economic growth and low current account deficit despite weaker outlook globally "have projected it as an outpost of opportunity for global investors", Jaitley added.
