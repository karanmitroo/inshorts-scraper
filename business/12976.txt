Indian Oil Corporation is the only Asian company that was offered a term contract by Nigeria for selling crude oil. Nigeria overhauled all term contracts last month. A term contract provides for assured oil supplies and comparatively cheaper prices. Under the contract, Indian Oil will buy 3 million tonnes of oil per annum from Nigeria, up from 1.7 million tonnes.
