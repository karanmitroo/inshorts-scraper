The Supreme Court on Monday refused to cancel the bail granted to Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra, an accused in 2G spectrum case, for allegedly trying to "sabotage the trial". The verdict came after CBI approached the apex court for cancellation of bail as Chandra was allegedly caught on tape trying to influence a public prosecutor in the case.
