An Indonesian court has ruled that Goldman Sachs should return shares in property developer Hanson International and pay $23.7 million compensation to tycoon Benny Tjokrosaputro in a legal tussle over ownership. Tjokrosaputro sued the US bank for $1.11 billion, accusing it of making "unlawful" trades in the shares. The ruling said Tjokrosaputro was legal owner of the 425 million shares.
