Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai has said, "The e-commerce market places need to have a no-fake policy to address problems relating to selling fake products on their platforms." Pai also said that the market places should build a good review mechanism to keep a quality check on products. "They should also take down sites selling such fake products," he added.
