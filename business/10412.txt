New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley on Monday asked the central bank to be cautious of interest rate increases amid risks to the US economy. He stated it was "premature" to eliminate policy tightening in 2016. This follows speculations of Fed resisting rate changes until December, a year since it raised rates, a first in nearly a decade.
