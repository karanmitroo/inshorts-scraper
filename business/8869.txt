The benchmark indices on Thursday ended with losses with the Sensex plunging by 439.23 points to end at 27,643.11, and the broader Nifty losing 135.45 points to close at 8,573.35 amid weak Asian cues. Reports of industrial production contracting by 0.7% in August dampened market sentiment. Infosys was the day's major gainer while Adani Ports SEZ was the biggest loser.
