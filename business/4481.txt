The RBI kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.25% during its bimonthly monetary policy review on Wednesday. This is the fourth time in a row that the repo rate has been kept unchanged. The reverse repo rate also remains unchanged at 6%. This is because RBI wants to see a more sustained trend of low inflation before changing its stance.
