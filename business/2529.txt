India's foreign exchange reserves crossed $400 billion-mark for the first time last week, RBI data showed. As on September 8, the foreign exchange reserves with RBI were at $400.73 billion, up by $2.6 billion from a week ago. Notably, India's holdings are about $376 billion if stripped of gold, which is enough to pay for about a year of imports.
