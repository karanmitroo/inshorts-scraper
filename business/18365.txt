BSE-benchmark Sensex on Friday surged 290 points to end at 19,270 on the back of FII buying in banking, capital goods and refinery shares amid recovery in the rupee (jumped 77-paise to 65.24) against dollar. New RBI governor Raghuram Rajan's announcements are also being seen as a reason for the boost in investor confidence and increased buying from lower levels.
