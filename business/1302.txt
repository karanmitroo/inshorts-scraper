RBI has launched an SMS campaign and a missed-call helpline to warn people against scams promising prize money from the RBI. "Don't pay fees or charges to get large sums in return. RBI/RBI Governor/Government never sends such email/SMS/call," the central bank said in an SMS. It is also asking public to give a missed call to the helpline number, 8691960000.
