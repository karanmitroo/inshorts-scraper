Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka is assured of around $10 million (₹65 crore) in annual compensation, irrespective of the company’s performance. This is because a clause in his contract makes him eligible to earn at least 90% of his total $11 million (₹71 crore) pay. Notably, Sikka can terminate his existing employment agreement with Infosys if this is not done.
