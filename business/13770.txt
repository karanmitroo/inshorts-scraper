The International Energy Agency on Friday said that the record 3 billion barrel surplus in oil stockpiles may deepen the rout in oil prices, which have already fallen nearly 40% in the past year. The agency also predicted that oil supplies next year from countries outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will decline the most in 23 years.
