Turkish Airlines on Saturday announced that it will offer laptops to business-class passengers on US and UK-bound flights. The laptops will be secure and protect users' privacy by "automatically deleting" personal data, Turkish Airlines added. The move comes after the UK and US banned travellers from several Muslim-majority countries from carrying large electronic devices in cabins.
