Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday ruled out the rollback of the proposed 1% excise duty on non-silver jewellery, amid protests from the jewellery traders. Gold is included in the proposed Goods and Service tax and the 1% excise is a preparation towards it, he said. Notably, jewellers across India have been on strike since March 2, protesting the duty.
