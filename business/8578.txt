Mahindra's used car sales platform Mahindra First Choice Wheels on Monday launched a new platform named 'True Time Bids' that allows buyers to participate in traditional 'on-the-ground' used car auctions via the internet in real-time. Vehicle auctions are typically conducted offline while some are also done online to attract non-local bidders. Mahindra's platform combines both the auction formats.
