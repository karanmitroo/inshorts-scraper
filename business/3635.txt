High street chemist Boots is facing criticism after refusing to reduce the cost of a morning-after pill. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service had asked retailers to offer a more affordable product. Boots said it would not lower the price as it did not want to be accused of "incentivising inappropriate use", which campaigners said was insulting and sexist.
