US Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen indicated on Friday that the US central bank may begin to raise interest rates later in the year without waiting for inflation and wages to improve further. However, she added that the increase would be gradual. The Federal Reserve has kept short-term borrowing rates almost zero since December 2008.
