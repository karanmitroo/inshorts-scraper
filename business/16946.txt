In a respite to common man, the government on Saturday decided to slash petrol price by Rs 1.82 per litre. The new rate will come into effect from Saturday midnight. This is the third reduction in fuel prices in the month of August. Prior to Independence Day, the petrol prices were slashed by Rs 1.89 per litre.
