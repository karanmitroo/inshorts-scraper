Japanese carmaker Toyota has recalled all of its zero-emission Mirai cars globally over a software glitch that can shut off the car's hydrogen power system. Mirai, which means 'future' in Japanese, was launched in December 2014. The recall is expected to affect nearly 2,800 Mirai cars, software of which will be updated by the company free of cost.
