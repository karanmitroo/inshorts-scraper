The Income Tax Department has claimed ₹24,843 crore from the proceeds of the proposed sale of Sahara Group's Aamby Valley City. The official liquidator of the Bombay High Court has pegged the property's reserve price at ₹37,392 crore. The I-T Department's claim, which excludes interest, is allegedly the tax due from Aamby Valley Limited, which owns Aamby Valley City.
