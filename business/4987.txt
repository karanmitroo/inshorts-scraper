Delta Airlines defended a pilot who got involved in an altercation between two women at an airport, saying he "de-escalated" the incident. The women were fighting when the pilot appeared to intervene, grabbing one's arm and striking her. Delta "immediately removed the pilot from duty", but put him back to work after an investigation found he helped end the fight.
