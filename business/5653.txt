Kitchen gadget company KitchenAid has been accused of sexism after posting an ad for pink appliances aimed at women. The ad featured the words "KitchenAid for Women" alongside the pink products, which were part of a limited edition range to raise money for a breast cancer charity. KitchenAid, however, stated the colour had been used as "a symbol of hope".
