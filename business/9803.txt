Africa's biggest economy Nigeria slid into recession for the first time in over 20 years after Nigerian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday announced a further contraction in GDP in the June quarter. This followed a decline in the non-oil sector amid a weaker currency, and lower prices in the oil sector. Further, it said annual inflation reached 17.1% in July.
