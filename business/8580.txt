Euro-zone's business activity expanded at the fastest rate in 10 months in October, despite firms raising prices at the sharpest rate in over five years, according to data. IHS Markit's Euro-zone flash composite PMI, an overall growth indicator, rose to 53.7. This indicates a shift from a buyer's to a seller's market, a shift in the right direction, analysts said.
