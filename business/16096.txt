The government will sell a stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corp this fiscal despite falling global oil prices, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Wednesday. The government was to sell 5% of its stake in ONGC to raise Rs 17,000-18,000 crore. However, the tumbling oil prices and the rising subsidy burden has triggered a slide in the ONGC stock.
