Future Group's Founder Kishore Biyani is going to launch his Retail 3.0 e-commerce business model called 'Tathaastu'. Biyani said first there was Retail 1, which was a brick and mortar store, then Retail 2 which was e-commerce and now Retail 3.0. Tathaastu, which roughly means 'ask and you shall receive', will focus on opening retail stores in every 2-kilometer radius.
