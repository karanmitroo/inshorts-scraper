The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed liquor baron Vijay Mallya to disclose details of overseas assets held by him and his family members to the banks seeking recovery of money loaned to his company 'Kingfisher Airlines'. The direction came after the court noted the unwillingness of Mallya to return to India and personally appear before it.
