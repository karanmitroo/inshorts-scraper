The government's Common Services Centres (CSCs) will now sell Patanjali and IFFCO (Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative) products, and offer cash deposit facilities through Digi Pay, an Aadhaar linked payment system. The products would be sold through village level entrepreneurs working under CSCs. CSCs are access points in villages where a host of government services are provided.
