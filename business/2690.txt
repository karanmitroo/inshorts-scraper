Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) chief Raghuram Rajan on Thursday said that he never resigned from the post, but had to step down as his term ended. Further, talking about demonetisation, Rajan said, "We still don't have entire data to talk on demonetisation. No date was fixed for demonetisation."
