LafargeHolcim CEO Eric Olsen has resigned amid an investigation into payments the company made to armed groups in Syria to keep a plant operating. The world’s largest cement maker said measures taken to continue safe operations at the plant were “unacceptable”, and “significant errors of judgment were made”. Although cleared of wrongdoing, Olsen said he was resigning effective July 15.
