In a move to attract and retain women employees, e-commerce giant Flipkart has offered a paid leave of 24 weeks (6 months) along with four months of flexible working hours under its new maternity leave policy. Moreover, a woman can even choose to take a year-long break without pay and come back to work at available positions at that time.
