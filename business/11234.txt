The government has decided to cancel all ongoing tenders for defence equipment won by Italy's Finmeccanica as a precursor to blacklisting of the firm, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said. However, the annual maintenance of already acquired defence equipment will be continued with the firm, he added. Notably, Finmeccanica is being investigated for bribery in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal.
