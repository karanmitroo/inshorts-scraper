IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh told a parliamentary panel that those who studied in "government schools or mohalla/village areas" cannot be trained to speak fluent English within  4-5 weeks. He added that India did not have the talent required to work in a consumer-facing industry. The panel had slammed IndiGo after a video had emerged showing IndiGo staff manhandling a passenger.
