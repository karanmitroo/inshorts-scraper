US crude oil prices on Monday traded near 11-year lows before rising around 2% to $36.31 per barrel. Brent crude fell to $36.33, only 13 cents above its December 2008 low, below which it would hit its weakest level since 2004. The International Energy Agency has forecasted oil prices to plunge further next year due to excessive supply.
