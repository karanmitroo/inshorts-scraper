Following a 257 point rise, the benchmark Sensex on Wednesday closed at 21,289; its second-highest closing level. The reason behind the hike is the ease in inflation, which gave rise to expectations that the RBI will keep interest rates on hold. The sensex had achieved its all time high of 21,326 on Dec-9, 2013.
