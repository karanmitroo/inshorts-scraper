The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has accused the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of crafting certain discussion papers to "serve the interests" of new players. The COAI said the regulator showed "complete disregard" towards the existing operators' "massive investments". It also slammed TRAI over regulations on internet telephony and call drops, among others.
