The Income Tax Department on Friday published a country-wide list of registered asset valuers on its website to help people who wish to declare their untaxed funds and properties. Asset valuers assess the value of an asset in the market. The government has initiated a four-month black money compliance window starting June 1 to enable people declare their untaxed assets.
