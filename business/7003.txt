The RBI on Tuesday issued a notification asking banks to take steps to ensure at least 40% of bank-notes are supplied to rural areas. The decision was taken after observing that currency supplied to rural areas was not proportional to the requirements, RBI stated. It further asked banks to issue notes in denominations of â‚¹500 and below to these areas.
