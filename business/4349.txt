Petrol pump dealers have withdrawn their proposed strike in protest of daily revision of fuel prices after the government agreed to change the timing to 6 AM daily instead of midnight. Daily price revision will start as scheduled from June 16. Initially, the 'no purchase, no sale' protest was planned due to inadequate infrastructure to revise prices every midnight.
