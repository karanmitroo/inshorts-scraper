The government is planning to deactivate SIM cards not linked to Aadhaar number by February 2018, according to reports. The Supreme Court had passed an order in February this year asking the government to link all SIM cards with Aadhaar within a year. The practice would "remove fictitious subscribers to crackdown fraudulent activities", the Court had said.
