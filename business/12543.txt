Credit rating firm India Ratings on Thursday revised its outlook on the Indian telecom sector from stable to "stable-to-negative" for the current fiscal. The agency mentioned that the upcoming launch of Reliance Jio will intensify competition in the sector, thereby squeezing the market share and credit metrics of incumbents. It further said this might reduce data average revenue per user.
