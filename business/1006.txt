The RBI will shortly issue new â‚¹10 notes under the Mahatma Gandhi series with chocolate brown colour as the base, according to reports. The note will reportedly feature a picture of the Konark Sun Temple. The design was approved by the government last week, and the RBI has already printed around 1 billion pieces of this new note, reports claimed.
