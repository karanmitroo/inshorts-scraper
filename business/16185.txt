 Tata Consultancy Services Thursday reported a 5.1% rise in its net profit to Rs 5,444 crore for the quarter ended December 31,2014. TCS' revenue was up 15.1% on year at Rs 24,501 crore. The year-end holidays normally result into weaker third-quarter sales for IT firms, and TCS said it expected the profit to be "in line with seasonal trends".
