China's estimated capital outflows for 2015 have reportedly increased more than seven times to over $1 trillion compared to $134.3 billion in 2014. Analysts attributed the increased Yuan outflow to China's "poor communication over its shift in currency policy" announced last year. Further, China's forex reserves plunged $513 billion in 2015 to $3.33 trillion, the first annual drop since 1992.
