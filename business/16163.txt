Airports Authority Employees Union has threatened to call a strike if the govt does not halt its airports privatization plan. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) employees' fresh agitation threat comes following the NDA govt's decision to privatize four airports - Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur and Ahmedabad. Earlier the govt had said it would privatize only Ahmedabad and Jaipur airports.
