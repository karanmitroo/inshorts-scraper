The Delhi and Mumbai airport operators have disputed the demand of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) for an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). If the dispute is not settled within 60 days, the matter could be referred to an arbitration tribunal. AAI had in September demanded an audit of the operators by the CAG.
