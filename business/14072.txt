South Korean (LCD) panel maker LG Display on Thursday reported a 30% slump in profit for July-September quarter to $293 million. The average selling price for panels also declined 5.5% from last year. Weaker currencies in emerging economies and slow growth in markets like China had a negative impact on sales.
