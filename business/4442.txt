NDTV Co-founder Prannoy Roy has said he, his wife Radhika Roy, and his company have "never touched one rupee of black money" and "never bribed one person in our lives". Alleging that institutions like CBI were being abused by politicians, Roy said, â€œThis is not about NDTV." His statement comes after CBI raided his homes over a bank fraud case.
