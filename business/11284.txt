China-based technology firm Lenovo Group on Thursday reported a loss of $128 million for the 2015-16 fiscal, its first loss in six years. The company had reported a profit of $829 million in 2014-15. The loss was attributed to a drop in earnings owing to acquisition and restructuring costs along with weak sales of smartphones and personal computers.
