Turkey's Celebi, which earlier expressed interest in buying Air India's ground handling subsidiary, has said the national carrier's bid value will fall if buyers are asked to retain the employees. Air India's ground handling subsidiary has a presence across 60 destinations. Celebi said if the firm wins the bid for the subsidiary, it may take 5-10 years to integrate fully.
