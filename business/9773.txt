The Reserve Bank of India on Friday issued a new series of benchmark 10-year government bonds at 6.97%, the lowest yield since 2009. The lower yield is a consequence of easier liquidity conditions in the market which has helped push down market borrowing rates, analysts said. Notably, RBI sold â‚¹8,000 crore of these bonds as part of Friday's auctions.
