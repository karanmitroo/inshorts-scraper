World's largest entertainment company Walt Disney has stopped doing business with one Chinese toymaker and put another on notice following reports of labour violations. The violations, which include lack of compliance on accurate record-keeping, health, fire safety and human resources practices, had been flagged by China Labor Watch, a New York-based non-profit that monitors manufacturing abroad.
