The Indian government's four mints have halted coin production as of January 8 owing to excess coins at the mints. Reportedly, over 250 crore pieces of manufactured coins in the storage rooms are waiting to be picked up by the RBI. The discontinuation of minting will have no effect on the circulation as there is no shortage of coins.
