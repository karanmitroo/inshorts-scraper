Workers at an Indonesian factory that makes Ivanka Trump brand's clothing have revealed they are subjected to "verbal abuse" and receive "poverty wages". They said that management often calls them derogatory names like “moron” and “monkey”, and that they work unpaid overtime. Some employees reportedly said they're paid so little that they cannot afford to live with their own children.
