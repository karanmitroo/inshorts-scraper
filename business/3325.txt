Coffee giant Starbucks has denied rumours that it plans to give a discount on food and beverages to undocumented immigrants in US on August 11. A senior Starbucks executive said the rumour is "completely false. One hundred percent fake". The fake advertisements promised 40% discount on any menu item for undocumented immigrants on the so-called "Dreamer Day".
