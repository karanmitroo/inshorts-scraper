Farmers will be permitted to withdraw up to â‚¹25,000 per week against the crop loans sanctioned in their names by banks. The announcement comes after reports of several farmers facing difficulty in buying seeds and paying farm labourers ahead of the onset of the Rabi season. Also, time limit in crop insurance premium cases has been increased to 15 days.
