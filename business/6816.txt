German automaker Volkswagen will recall nearly 3.43 lakh diesel cars across 13 models in India as a part of a global recall to replace a software that helped vehicles fake pollution emission tests. The models to be recalled include Polo, Vento, Jetta, Audi A4 and A6 among others. Volkswagen has paid over $19 billion in fines for cheating emission tests.
