The Kerala High Court on Friday put a stay for two months on the National Green Tribunal's May 23 order asking the state to stop the registration of diesel vehicles with engine capacity of over 2000 cc. The court, however, did not interfere with the ban on diesel vehicles older than 10 years plying in six cities of the state.
