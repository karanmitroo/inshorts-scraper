Falling for the fifth straight session, the Sensex on Wednesday closed down by 71 points at 26,724.01, led by losses in auto, FMCG and pharma stocks. The 30-share index came under pressure due to continued capital outflows and weak rupee. The 50-share Nifty also fell, slipping below the 8,000-mark in the trade before closing down by 37.80 points at 8,029.80.
