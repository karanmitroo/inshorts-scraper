Hong Kong's stock exchange operator said on Saturday that the exchange would incorporate volatility controls and introduce a closing auction by 2016, amid a 28% fall in Chinese shares since June. The HKEx had delayed the reintroduction of closing auctions for several years as local brokers claimed it would facilitate market manipulation, but finally bowed to pressure from international investors.
