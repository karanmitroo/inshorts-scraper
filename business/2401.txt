Gatorade has agreed to pay $300,000 (â‚¹1.94 crore) as settlement for promoting misleading statements about water in its video game, in which players had to refuel Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt. The complaint alleged that game encouraged users to keep their performance level high and avoid water. Notably, Bolt's fuel level went down after drinking water but increased after drinking Gatorade.
