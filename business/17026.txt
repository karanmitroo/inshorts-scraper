Owing to a raw material shortage, Tata Steel Ltd has shut down one of its ferro alloys plants in Odisha. Tata Steel sourced ore for the 50k tonne-per-year Bamnipal plant from its captive chromite mine in Sukinda. The suspension of operations at Sukinda and Bamnipal would mean more than 6,000 job cuts, the company stated.
