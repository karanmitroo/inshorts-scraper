American aerospace firm Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement with Tata Advanced Systems on Monday to produce F-16 fighter planes in India. Lockheed and Tata said moving the production base to India would still retain jobs in the US. Notably, the announcement comes days before PM Narendra Modi's trip to Washington for his first meeting with US President Donald Trump.
