Rovio, the Finnish developer of "Angry Birds," said April 28 that it had earned about $37.2 million in profit in 2013, some 50% less than it had earned in 2012 (it earned $76.8 million that year). The company attributed stiff free-to-play, or freemium, competition - with games like "Clash of Clans" and "Candy Crush Saga" - for the profit drop.
