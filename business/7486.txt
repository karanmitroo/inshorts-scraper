Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that if the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not rolled out by September 16, 2017, there will be no taxation in the country. There is a constitutional compulsion to have GST in place before September, otherwise the country does not run, and the tax is "absolutely essential," he stated.
