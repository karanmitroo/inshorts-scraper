Telecom giant BT has been fined $53 million (₹345 crore) for a "serious breach" of rules, making it the largest fine imposed on a telco. BT will also have to pay $376 million (₹2,440 crore) in compensation to rivals. BT allegedly misused its contracts to cut compensation payments for delays in connecting high-speed business lines to other telcos including Vodafone.
