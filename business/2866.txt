RBI has reportedly notified commercial banks of at least 26 defaulter accounts with which it wants lenders to begin debt resolution before initiating bankruptcy proceedings. RBI said these accounts should first be resolved through any of its schemes before December 13, failing which cases should be filed against the firms under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code before December 31.
