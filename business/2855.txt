Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg in a tweet said that there is no proposal to re-introduce the ₹1,000 note. Earlier, media reports suggested that two RBI printing presses had been chosen to print new ₹1,000 notes. Notably, the government had announced the withdrawal of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes on November 8, 2016.
