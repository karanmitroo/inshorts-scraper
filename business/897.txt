Kazakhstan has overtaken Iraq as the biggest over-producer in the pact between Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies to curb oil output. Kazakhstan's output in November and December last year was about 130,000 barrels a day above the target agreed with OPEC. Notably, Kazakhstan had pledged to pump 20,000 barrels a day less under the pact.
