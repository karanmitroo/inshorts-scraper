The San Francisco-based taxi hailing service, Uber, is reportedly seeking a $1 billion credit line from banks. The company is in talks with major banks to negotiate a deal for loan where about six to seven banks are reportedly interested. This credit facility may be out by next year and is not needed for Uberâ€™s day-to-day business.
