Amid attacks on Ravi Venkatesan by some stakeholders, Infosys Independent Director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw on Monday supported him saying he was a valuable board member. She further said, "It's sad that people comment so loosely without any credible facts." Notably, former Infosys director Mohandas Pai had on Twitter said that Venkatesan was in power play and needed to be sidelined.
