PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has said, "People say multitasking isn't very good. If I didn't multitask, I have no idea how I'd survive." She said that one has to develop more skills to write lists and learn how to prioritise. "I make a list every day of 50, 60 items, and I tick off what I've doneâ€”tiny things," she added.
