World Bank's chief economist Kaushik Basu on Saturday said that India's GDP numbers are "very dependable" and that "rigging" of data is not possible. Basu’s statement came in response to questions over the Central Statistics Office’s projection of 7.6% growth for the ongoing fiscal. Notably, Basu has earlier served as the Chief Economic Advisor to the government of India.
