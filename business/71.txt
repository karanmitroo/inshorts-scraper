Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said that cryptocurrencies are failing as a form of money and "have exhibited the classic hallmarks of bubbles". Carney added "time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system" as they raise issues around "market integrity, money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion".
