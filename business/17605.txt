DGCA has suspended the flying licence of the four pilots who allowed visitors inside the cockpit mid-air, while another pilot who allowed passengers inside the cockpit of a grounded plane has been taken off flying duties. DGCA also issued directive to all airlines that action will be taken against them too, apart from the crew at fault, for this violation.
