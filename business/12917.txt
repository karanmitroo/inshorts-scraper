Federal safety regulators on Friday asked Japanese automotive parts company Takata Corporation to recall another five million vehicles containing faulty airbags including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz cars. The move comes after Takata was found responsible for the tenth death caused by its faulty airbag. Nineteen million vehicles with Takata's faulty airbags have already been recalled.
