Reeling under political pressure, the Air India (AI) management Thursday unconditionally revoked the termination of 12 hostess and a flight purser who had been sacked earlier this month for reporting late or skipping duty. The decision was taken after the Shiv Sena-backed breakaway faction of the All India Cabin Crew Association (AICCA) held a meeting with AI chairman Rohit Nandan.
