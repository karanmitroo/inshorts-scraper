The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world economy is "highly vulnerable" and called for new mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable countries. The report has asked G20 economies to prepare contingency plans, if growth keeps wilting. The IMF last month trimmed the global GDP forecast for 2016 and 2017, and said a further downgrade is likely.
