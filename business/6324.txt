German satirical website Der Postillon has created a fake ad by furniture company IKEA, offering US President Donald Trump a "Börder Wåll" to be built along the Mexican border with a 12,000-page instruction manual. The wall, which can be assembled by just two people, will cost taxpayers $10 billion, down from the $15-25 billion projected for the actual wall.
