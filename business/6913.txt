Twitter has suspended the account of Martin Shkreli, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO who was accused of raising price of an HIV drug by 5,400%, for the alleged "targeted harassment" of a journalist. Freelance reporter Lauren Duca had posted about several 'unwanted digital advances' by Shkreli including a message in which he invited her to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.
