Real estate platform MagicBricks is running a campaign where it turns its old billboard flexes into waterproof sleeping bags called 'MagicBag'. The sleeping bags are lined with warm blankets on the inside. These sleeping bags are being distributed to thousands of homeless people in the Delhi-NCR region.
