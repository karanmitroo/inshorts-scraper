The government has decided to replace pre-investment restrictions on some nations with better post-investment checks and security. The govt wants to put a clause in contracts with investors from countries like China to legally empower the former to take action, including cancellation of the contract, in cases involving spying or sabotage. Better product testing facility is also planned.
