The London-Mumbai Jet Airways flight that was escorted by German fighter jets after it lost contact over European airspace was a training flight for the pilot-in-command, according to reports. The flight lost contact with Air Traffic Control due to a "frequency goof-up" and its pilot missed contact attempts on emergency frequency "due to howling noise," the reports added.
