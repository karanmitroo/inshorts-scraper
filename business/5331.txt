Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Communications has laid off about 800 employees, including some senior executives, according to reports. The company has also reportedly not been making payments to vendors and other telecom companies on time. The cuts come as the company faces falling revenues and profits due to increased competition from new entrant Reliance Jio.
