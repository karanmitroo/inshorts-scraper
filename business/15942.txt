Falling for the third straight session, the rupee on Wednesday slipped by six paise against the dollar to close at fresh one-month low of 62.25. The Indian unit came under pressure due to persistent dollar demand from banks and importers. The Indian rupee has now fallen by 56 paise or 0.91 per cent in the three consecutive days.
