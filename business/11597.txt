The Union Cabinet on Wednesday liberalised the coal supply procedure for central, state and independent power generating firms. As per the decision, all long-term coal linkages of state power plants will be assigned to individual states or agencies nominated by it. In case of central government-owned plants, the parent organisation will be granted the allocation.
