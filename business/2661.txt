Pakistan's largest bank, Habib Bank, has been fined $225 million (over â‚¹1,400 crore) by the US for "grave" compliance failures over regulations concerning money laundering and terror financing. It has also been ordered to shut down in the US. Regulators said the bank facilitated billions of dollars in transactions with a Saudi bank, which reportedly has links to al-Qaeda.
