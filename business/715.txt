Gold price increased by ₹1,000 in last 19 days to reach a 14-month high of ₹31,450 per ten grams in the national capital. This came as the US dollar weakened to nearly three-year low against several major global currencies. Silver prices regained the ₹41,000-mark by jumping ₹1,100 on Thursday on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
