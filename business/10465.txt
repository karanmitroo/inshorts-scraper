Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked policy think-tank NITI Aayog to prepare a 15-year vision document constituting "drastic" reforms, efficient use of natural resources, innovation and technology-led governance. Stating that India cannot wait for incremental change, Modi called for "transformational" change. The document's first draft is expected to be ready before the Budget in 2017.
