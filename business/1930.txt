The Saudi government has announced $1 billion in funding for British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group space companies. The investment, which has an option for an additional $480 million, is expected to fund Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company, and Virgin Orbit. Calling this a sign of confidence, Richard Branson said they are now "months away" from taking people into space.
