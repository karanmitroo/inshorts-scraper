Any bank branch that refuses to exchange soiled or scribbled currency notes from people will have to pay a penalty of ₹10,000, the RBI has clarified. However, a bank may levy a service charge if a person exchanges more than 20 notes, or notes worth ₹5,000 per day. The RBI also clarified that such notes continue to be legal tender.
