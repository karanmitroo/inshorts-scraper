Twitter's Co-founder Biz Stone has returned to the company six years after he left it in 2011. In a blog post, Stone wrote, "My excitement at the chance to work on Twitter again is over-the-moon". Stone recently sold the company he founded, Jelly, to Pinterest, and the deal did not require him to work at the company anymore.
