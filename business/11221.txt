Suzuki Motor Corporation on Tuesday denied using wrong methods in testing the fuel economy of its cars in Japan, saying there is no universal method of calculating mileage. This comes after the automaker on May 18 admitted to using fuel economy testing methods not compliant with Japanese regulations on 2.1 million vehicles sold in the country since 2010.
