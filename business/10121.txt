The Personnel Ministry has asked all central government departments to set up committees on pay related anomalies due to the implementation of Seventh Pay Commission’s recommendations. The committees will be at two levels – National, for anomalies common to two or more departments and for common categories of employees, and Departmental, for matters pertaining exclusively to that department.
