The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has said several builders diverted nearly â‚¹1,000 crore collected from homebuyers to other projects. A YEIDA official said that adequate time was given to all builders to defend themselves. "Now, it is time to act against the builders who diverted the funds and also did not cooperate in the audit," the official added.
