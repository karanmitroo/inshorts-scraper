A US jury on Friday ordered Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to pay $119.6 million to Apple Inc, after it found the South Korean smartphone maker had infringed two Apple patents. On the other hand, Samsung has also claimed that Apple violated two patents on streaming video, and seeks to ban the iPhone 5, asserting a $6 million damages claim.
