Pharmaceutical major Cipla has announced that its UK-arm has completed a $550 million acquisition of two US-based firms InvaGen Pharmaceuticals and Exelan Pharmaceuticals. The deal was made by Cipla (EU) through a wholly owned special purpose vehicle which would merge into InvaGen. This is Cipla's second major acquisition in its 80-year history, after the takeover of Cipla Medpro, South Africa.
