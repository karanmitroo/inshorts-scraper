Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the UK is liberal enough to permit defaulters to stay in the country. Referring to loan default as a major problem, Jaitley said India was no longer willing to let defaulters escape. Notably, Jaitley's statement came in reference to Vijay Mallya, who moved to UK after banks sued him to recover over â‚¹9,000 crore.
