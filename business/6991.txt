Indonesia’s government said it has terminated all business partnerships with US banking major JPMorgan Chase. This came after JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia’s equity market in a November report as a “tactical response” to Donald Trump's election win. The Finance Ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer, a senior official said, adding, the bank's report was not "accurate or credible".
