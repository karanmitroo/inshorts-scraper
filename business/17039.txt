Korean automaker, Hyundai, has officially revealed the much-anticipated - Elite i20 - ahead of its launch on Aug-11. The most interesting part about the new model is its rear profile, that sports a new wrap-around window and 'boomerang' shaped tail-lights, thus giving the hatchback a completely fresh look. It was designed at Hyundai Motor's Design Centre Europe in Russelsheim, Germany.
