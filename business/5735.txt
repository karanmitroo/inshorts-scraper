Marks & Spencer is launching cafes designed to provide a space for people to share stories about their mental health, as an initiative to soothe stressed shoppers. The retailer is partnering with comedian Ruby Wax to launch the 'Frazzled Cafe' project in UK. It said the sessions weren't "therapy" but aimed to provide a space "where people can talk openly".
