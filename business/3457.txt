Aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney is paying compensation to IndiGo for glitches in its engines that power Airbus' new A320neo planes. President Aditya Ghosh said IndiGo was forced to ground nine such jets recently, and continues to have high number of engine removals, while sufficient spares aren't available. "The operational disruptions are quite challenging, and we're not happy," he added.
