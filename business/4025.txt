US grocery giant Whole Foods has recalled approximately 200 kilograms of chicken salad, which actually contained tuna salad. The product wrongly labeled "buffalo style chicken salad" was distributed to approximately 35 Whole Foods stores. Consumers who purchased the product have been asked to toss it out or return it to their local store.
