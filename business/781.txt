Telecom regulator TRAI has recommended allowing mobile communication and internet services for passengers during air travel in India. However, it suggested a minimum height restriction of 3,000 metres for mobile communication, to maintain compatibility with terrestrial mobile networks. It further suggested that a separate category of in-flight service providers should be created.
