The Delhi high court Friday censured the Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) and its dean Arindam Chaudhuri for misleading students. The court said that it deluded students by saying it possessed the approvals to offer MBA and BBA programmes. It held that IIPM was not entitled to run or advertise such management courses as it lacked AICTE approval.
