Chinese aviation regulator has fully opened its civilian airport market to private capital for the first time, Chinese media reported on Sunday. State-owned airports would be reduced and public-private partnerships will be encouraged to improve "quality and efficiency". Further, private investment will not need the regulator's approval to fund services and operations of civilian airports.
