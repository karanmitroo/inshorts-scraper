RBI Deputy Governor SS Mundra on Friday said no conclusion can be drawn yet on whether the offshore entities revealed by the "Panama Papers" leak are illegal. However, some “unverified assumptions” from government indicate that entities of most of the Indians associated with the leaks were opened in Panama under RBI’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) as per norms, Mundra added.
