Unilever, the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap, has rejected a $143 billion (₹9.6 lakh crore) takeover bid from food company Kraft Heinz. Unilever said the offer “fundamentally undervalues” the business, and that it “does not see the basis for any further discussions”. Notably, if a deal is agreed, it would be the third biggest takeover in history.
