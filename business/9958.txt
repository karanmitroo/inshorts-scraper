American retailer Bed Bath & Beyond said on Wednesday that it has ordered an external audit of the textiles from Mumbai-based Welspun India, one of the world's largest textile manufacturer. This comes after another US retailer Target had accused Welspun of selling fraudulent Egyptian-cotton sheets, severing its ties with the company, following which, Welspun lost 42% of its market value.
