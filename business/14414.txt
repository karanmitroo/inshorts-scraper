Germany has launched a criminal probe against Volkswagen’s former CEO Martin Winterkorn on Monday, as it was revealed that 11 million of the company’s diesel vehicles worldwide were equipped with the software that duped emissions tests. Winterkorn had resigned from his position last week and had claimed to be oblivious to the fraud.
