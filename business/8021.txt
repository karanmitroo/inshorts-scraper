The Finance Ministry on Sunday directed banks to increase the cash withdrawal limit at ATMs from the existing ₹2,000 to ₹2,500 per day in the newly recalibrated ATMs. The recalibrated ATMs are those ATMs which can dispense the new ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes. Notably, all the 2.2 lakh ATMs across India need to be recalibrated for dispensing the new notes.
