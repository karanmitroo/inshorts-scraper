US-based sports broadcaster ESPN would partner with Multi Screen Media Pvt. Ltd (MSM) which operates Sony channels in India, and launch new sports channels, a multi-sports website and a mobile app. Sony Kix would be rebranded as SONY ESPN as part of the deal. ESPN had left Indian media after the joint venture ESPN Star Sports split two years ago.
