An argument broke out on a Ryanair flight when a passenger urinated in a bottle as all of the plane's toilets were out of order. Cabin crew were filmed arguing with the man on the flight after the urine allegedly 'splashed' on an attendant's jacket. The man was reportedly ordered to pay a fine of £80 (₹6,700) by a stewardess.
