British bank, Barclays, on Wednesday ousted its CEO Antony Jenkins as it looked to accelerate strategic change and boost shareholder returns. The move came just 3 months after John McFarlane took over as the bank's chairman and announced intentions of speeding up its turnaround plan. McFarlane will assume executive responsibilities until the bank searches for a suitable successor.
