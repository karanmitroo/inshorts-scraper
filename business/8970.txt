Tata Steel's shares on Monday hit a 22-month high, gaining 2.9% in intraday trade after the European Commission imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of two steel products from China. This comes amid reports of Tata Steel moving closer to a merger of its European arm with Germany-based ThyssenKrupp. The company's stock has gained around 60.3% so far this year.
