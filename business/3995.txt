Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications has blamed "freebies" offered by a new operator for problems in the sector. "The telecom industry's current financial problem to some extent can be attributed to the entry of a new telecom operator and its strategy of freebies to gain customer and market share," RCom said. Notably, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio entered the market in 2016.
