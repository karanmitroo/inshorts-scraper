Donald Trump's firm charged his son Eric $1.2 million (â‚¹7.7 crore) for charity events at a Trump-branded golf course despite claims that these were staged for free. Moreover, Donald Trump Foundation used Eric Trump Foundation to convert $100,000 in donations into revenue for Trump Organisation. Further, $500,000 given to Eric's foundation was re-donated to charities linked to Trump family members.
