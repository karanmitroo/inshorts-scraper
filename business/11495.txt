The Delhi High Court on Monday sought the Income Tax (I-T) department's response to telecom firm Vodafone's plea challenging the department's show cause notice directing special audit of Vodafone's accounts for the assessment year 2012-13. Vodafone had alleged that the order had been passed to "buy more time". The I-T department was asked to file its reply by July 28.
