An $18.12 billion class action lawsuit against Mastercard is being revived after lawyers filed to appeal against a ruling that barred the case from heading to trial last month. The lawsuit was lodged on behalf of nearly 4.6 crore consumers. It alleged that Mastercard's interchange fees forced consumers to pay higher prices over a 16-year period, breaching EU competition law.
