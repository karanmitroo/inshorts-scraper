IT firm Infosys has clarified that it does not expect any layoffs under the fallout of the Royal Bank of Scotland project "ramp down". While 3,000 employees will be affected after RBSâ€™ decision, they will be absorbed in other projects over the next few months, the company reportedly said. This follows RBS' cancellation of a five-year contract with Infosys.
