The Gujarat government today cut the Value Added Tax (VAT) on fuel by 4%, becoming the first state to do so. After the reduction in VAT, petrol will get cheaper by ₹2.93 per litre and diesel by ₹2.72 per litre in the state. This comes after the Centre cut excise duty on fuel by ₹2/litre, asking states to cut VAT.
