Volkswagen on Friday confirmed that it will pay up to $1.21 billion to 652 US brand dealers as part of the compensation for losses suffered by them due to the German automaker's emissions scandal. In June, Volkswagen agreed to a $15.3 billion settlement involving a buyback of 4,75,000 US vehicles after admitting to have violated fuel emission tests since 2009.
