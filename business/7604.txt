Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has reportedly filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI), accusing telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea of acting as a cartel in the telecom market. The complaint was filed this month and CCI is yet to take a decision, sources said. Earlier, Jio accused incumbents of not providing enough connectivity for completing calls.
