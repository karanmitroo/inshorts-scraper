Germany's second-largest airline Air Berlin's CEO Thomas Winkelmann has blamed long delays in the opening of a new Berlin airport for the airline's insolvency. Winkelmann's comments came a day after Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy amid key shareholder Etihad Airways withdrawing funding after years of losses. The government has granted a loan of over $175 million while negotiations continue.
