The National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Monday said it has established a trade repository for Indian corporate debt in a bid to increase liquidity and transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) deals. The repository, launched on July 1, will provide consolidated information on OTC deals in corporate bonds across exchanges. Currently, about 80% of such deals occur on the NSE platform.
