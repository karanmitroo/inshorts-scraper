Taxi service provider Meru on Tuesday introduced a first-of-its-kind car pooling service which allows personal car-sharing option for people travelling in the same area. Called 'CarPool', the service has been included in the Meru Cabs mobile app and will be available across the country. "This is a pure customer to customer service", Siddhartha Pahwa, the company's chief executive, said.
