State Bank of India (SBI) Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya on Saturday said that the merger of associate banks with SBI was a strong structural reform, and results will start showing in 3-4 quarters. She said that recapitalisation of banks is necessary, but added that banks like SBI are not in need of it as they are well capitalised.
