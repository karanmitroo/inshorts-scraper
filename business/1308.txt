The government is likely to change rules to allow foreign airlines to bid for Air India, according to reports. Foreign airlines must have a local joint venture with an Indian partner if they intend to bid for the stake. Existing rules allow foreign airlines to own as much as 49% in an Indian airline, with the exception of Air India.
