Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Saturday that the government was trying to make the tax system fair. "We are trying to rationalise taxes - that is, lower taxes and introduce a non-adversarial and fair system," Jaitley said during an event organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the UK-India Business Council in London.
