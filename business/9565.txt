The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Tuesday warned that the global oil surplus that has affected prices and budgets of producer countries will persist through the next year. Demand growth is slowing and supply is rising resulting in record levels of oil stockpiles in OECD countries, it said. IEA had earlier predicted the market would return to equilibrium this year.
