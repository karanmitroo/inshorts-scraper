Aviation regulator DGCA has cancelled the flying licence of a senior pilot of SpiceJet on failing to clear the mandatory alcohol test. He reportedly failed the breath analyser test thrice. Notably, aircraft rules prohibit crew members from taking alcoholic drinks 12-hours prior to a flight and it is mandatory for them to undergo alcohol test before and after the flight.
