Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan said the company should've increased the size of its buyback plan to boost investor confidence. He also maintained the probe by US law firms will have no impact on the offer. Terming the timing of the â‚¹13,000 crore offer as "unusual", he said the board could've been more "forceful" in setting the buyback's price target.
