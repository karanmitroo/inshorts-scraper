South Korean container carrier Hanjin on Friday stated that cargo owners were withholding around $80 million in payments for completed shipments, affecting its ability to move stranded freight. "Hanjin is not the only bad guy here," the carrier stated. In August, Hanjin, the world's seventh-largest container carrier, had filed for bankruptcy, stranding nearly $14 billion worth of cargo at sea.
