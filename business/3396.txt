UK clothing retailer Next has recalled a pair of children's sandals after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission revealed the linings of the shoes contained benzidine, which could cause cancer with prolonged contact with skin. The company earlier in June had recalled another children's sandals after discovering that the shoes presented a possible choking hazard.
