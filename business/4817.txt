Stating that state-owned BSNL has successfully shed its "poor service provider" tag, Union Minister Manoj Sinha claimed BSNL's full form used to be 'Bhai Sahab Nahi Lagega'. However, in the last two years this has been replaced with 'Behtar Seva ki Nai Lagan', Sinha stated. BSNL has done so by expanding its network and investing in new technology, he added.
