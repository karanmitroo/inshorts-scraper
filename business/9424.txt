According to a Cambridge study, traders who are better at listening to the 'gut feelings' or the signals their hearts give them about market patterns, make more money and survive longer in financial markets. The 'gut feelings' provide feedback to brains to avoid loss-making gambles. The study also found that traders have stronger 'gut feelings' than the general population.
