Alibaba's e-commerce platform Tmall is launching two 'cat-shaped' car vending machines in China, the company has said. The model will allow users to scan a car and find it on Alibaba's app to schedule a test drive. Users can then visit the vending machine, which will scan their faces using facial-recognition technology for a three-day test drive of cars.
