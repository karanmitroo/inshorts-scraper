Standard & Poor downgraded Brazil's credit rating to junk to BB+ from BBB- on Wednesday. This rating will damage the market sentiment and investment in Brazil as the rating implies higher risk. Experts say that India (BBB- rating) is much better placed now in the emerging markets space (BRICS) and will outpace major economies in terms of economic growth rate.
