Customers at the supermarket chain Aldi in the UK have been charged twice for their shopping at a number of stores which the chain has blamed on a "processing error". The error was reported to have affected about 6,000 customers. While many customers have been refunded, some claimed their bank accounts had been left overdrawn due to the error.
