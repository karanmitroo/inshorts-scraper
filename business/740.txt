UBS Chairman Axel Weber has said that Bitcoin is "not an investment we would advise". He said the bank won't trade Bitcoin or offer it to retail clients as increased regulation could lead to "massive" drop in value. "We fear that...if these investments implode and the market corrects, then investors will be looking at 'who sold us this?'," he added.
