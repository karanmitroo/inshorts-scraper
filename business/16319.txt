Falling for the fourth straight session, rupee Monday declined by ten paise to hit over 13-month closing low of 63.67 against the dollar. The Indian unit came under pressure due to sustained dollar demand from importers. However, the downside in rupee was limited by firm local equities and fresh capital inflows. On Friday, the Indian currency had ended at 63.57.
