South Korean electronics major Samsung and its rival LG have been sued by a former LG sales manager over an agreement of not hiring each other's employees and conspiring to suppress wages. The former LG employee further claims that the agreement dates back to 2005 and the top management at both the companies are aware of the no cross-hiring deal.
