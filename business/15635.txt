The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday imposed penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on 16 central cooperative banks for not complying with its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering guidelines. "The lenders were issued show-cause notices and the action was taken after going through the responses," the RBI said in a notification.
