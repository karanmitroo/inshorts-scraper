A parliamentary panel has suggested the merger of state-run telecom firms Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) for their long-term survival. The committee said the merger would give both the entities a chance to compete against private sector players. The Telecom Department informed the panel that both firms are in financial losses and face declining revenues.
