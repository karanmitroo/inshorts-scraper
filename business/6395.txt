ICICI Bank has allowed its customers to process UPI transactions via Flipkart-owned digital wallet app PhonePe. "The merchant has now adhered to the NPCI guidelines on interoperability by making the necessary corrections in its app," said the bank. Transactions through PhonePe were blocked by the bank accusing it of "restrictive practice" by allowing payments only through its own UPI handle.
