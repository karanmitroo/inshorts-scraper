Patanjali CEO and primary stakeholder Acharya Balkrishna has said that Baba Ramdev does not believe in making a profit on everything. He added that some of the products are sold at par while some like the ayurvedic chai are even sold at a loss. Balkrishna added that Patanjali is running 1,500 chikitsalayas and 5,000 seva kendras across the country.
