Mass media firm Thomson Reuters, on Tuesday, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and said it would be restructuring its workforce and cutting around 2,000 jobs worldwide. The restructuring, that would affect 4% of the total workforce, would be carried out across 39 countries and 150 locations. It is about simplification, taking out layers that have slowed us down, the company said.
