Dismissing Vijay Mallyaâ€™s claim that he is unable to return to India, the government on Thursday said any citizen can apply for an 'Emergency Certificate' at an Indian Embassy to return. This facility is available to Mallya, should he wish to apply for it, the government stated. Earlier, Mallya said he was unable to return as his passport was suspended.
