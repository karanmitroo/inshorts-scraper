The Engineering Exports Promotion Council on Friday said India's engineering exports may fall by $8 billion to $62 billion this fiscal, given the slump in global commodity prices. The trade body added that despite a 7-8% depreciation in rupee against dollar in 2015, engineering exports, which account for 23% of total exports, witnessed a 14% drop during April-November against 2014.
