The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed power distribution companies (discoms) in Delhi to "remove wires twined around the trees" within the next 20 weeks. The NGT also asked the firms to cooperate with civic authorities in trimming the branches of such trees. Earlier, NGT had on March 23 given discoms an ultimatum to remove the wires within six weeks.
