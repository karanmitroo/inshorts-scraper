A clothing range launched by KA Design bearing the 'swastika' as a fashion logo, has been pulled after criticism from Jewish groups, and after social media backlash. It was launched with the aim of reclaiming the Nazi symbol as an emblem of peace and love. The company explained that this is a "new" swastika, representing love, peace and freedom.
