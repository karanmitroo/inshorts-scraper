The Karnataka High Court on Thursday summoned liquor baron Vijay Mallya to appear before it on November 24. The case pertains to Mallya allegedly violating an undertaking given by him and his companies not to transfer their equity shares in United Breweries to Diageo. The Debt Recovery Tribunal had earlier restrained the equity shares' transfer of United Breweries to anyone.
