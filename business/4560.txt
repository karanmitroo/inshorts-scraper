For the fifth time, bankers failed to auction Kingfisher House, the erstwhile headquarters of Vijay Mallya-owned and now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines, despite a 38% drop in its reserve price since it was first auctioned. The 17-lender consortium led by SBI had lowered the reserve price of the property to ₹93.50 crore. Notably, Mallya owes over ₹9,000 crore to the lenders.
