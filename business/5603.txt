German lender KfW mistakenly transferred over $5.4 billion (over â‚¹35,000 crore) to four banks because of a technical glitch. Notably, the same bank had incorrectly transferred over $320 million to US bank Lehman Brothers on the day it filed for bankruptcy following the 2008 financial crisis. The transfer turned into a scandal, with some newspapers calling KfW "Germany's dumbest bank".
