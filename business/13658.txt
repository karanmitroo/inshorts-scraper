SBI declared Vijaya Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines as 'wilful defaulters' for defaulting on a  â‚¹6,900 crore loan from 17 lenders. Kingfisher's holding company United Breweries Holdings was also declared as a wilful defaulter. The lenders have reportedly decided to e-auction the assets of the defunct airline to recover dues. However, Vijay Mallya can challenge the label in the Supreme Court.
