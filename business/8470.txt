The worldâ€™s biggest planemaker Boeing will not cut the production of its 777 jetliner by over two aircraft a month, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Wednesday. The US-based manufacturer already has plans to cut the production of 777s by 1.3 planes a month from its current production of 8.3 planes every month.
