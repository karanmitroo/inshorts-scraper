IndiGo's CFO Rohit Philip has said there was no financial impact from the grounding of Airbus A320 NEO planes following issues with Pratt and Whitney engines fitted on them. The engine has been having start-up issues and other technical glitches since last year. Philip, however, declined to comment on whether the airline would seek compensation for the engine issues.
