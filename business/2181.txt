Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said India's transition to the GST has been "fairly smooth" despite attempts by "ill-informed" opposition leaders to derail its implementation. Jaitley said under GST, government has unveiled attractive schemes to ensure that the non-compliant in India become compliant. India is now capable of taking big decisions and implementing them at large-scale, he added.
