Telecom majors Airtel, Vodafone and Idea have slammed TRAI accusing it of delay in taking action even as norms of network testing were being flouted by Reliance Jio. TRAI had issued a consultation paper on May 1, which telcos claimed was no longer relevant since the â€œdamage has already been done" by Jio. However, Jio has dismissed the charges.
