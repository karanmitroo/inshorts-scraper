Virgin Group's billionaire Founder Richard Branson on Thursday called US President Donald Trump's move to pull the US out of the Paris Climate accord "naive". He added that Trump failed to recognise that clean energy is cheaper than coal and oil and will create "massively more jobs." Branson added, "We wanted the USA to not talk selfishly".
