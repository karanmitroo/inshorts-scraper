British investigators found two firms owned by baron Vijay Mallya carried out transactions with a Liberia-registered company named in the Panama Papers, reports said. The two entities controlled by Mallya had a stake in Kingfisher Airlines before its merger with Deccan Aviation. In 2007-08, Mallya had transferred shares he held in one of those two firms to the Liberia-registered company.
