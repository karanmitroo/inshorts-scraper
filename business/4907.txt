The first Chinese-built passenger jet, C-919, completed its maiden flight on May 5. The twin-engine 158-174 seat passenger jet, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation, features several imported elements like German landing gear and an Austrian interior. Notably, China is expected to overtake the United States as the largest aviation market by 2024.
