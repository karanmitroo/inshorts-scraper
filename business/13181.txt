IDBI Bank has reportedly hired seven banks for assistance in raising ₹3,771 crore through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) issuance. HSBC, Citibank, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, SBI Capital, and IDBI Capital (IDBI’s investment banking arm) would facilitate the offer. QIPs allow India-listed firms to raise funds from domestic markets without submitting pre-issue filings.
