To reduce cost of mobile services, TRAI on Monday recommended allowing sharing of all categories of airwaves held by operators. The price of spectrum in the last auction was five times spectrum allocated under old licensing regime. Presently, operators are allowed to share passive infrastructure like mobile towers, which has helped them reducing cost, but not active infrastructure like spectrum.
