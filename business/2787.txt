Technical snags faced by A320neo aircraft, operated by IndiGo and GoAir, pose a "safety issue", Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has said. "Fuel efficiency is one thing and risking life is another," he added. Notably, at least eight A320neo planes of IndiGo and two of GoAir have been grounded due to issues related to Pratt & Whitney engines.
