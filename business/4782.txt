Barclays CEO Jes Staley was fooled by an email prankster who was pretending to be the bank's Chairman John McFarlane. The email, sent under the subject line "the fool doth think he is wise", shows Staley being told "you owe me a large Scotch". The letter also includes a poem with the first letter of each line spelling out "whistleblower".
