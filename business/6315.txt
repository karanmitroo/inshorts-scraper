The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed the Payment of Wages (Amendment) Bill, 2017 which seeks to enable employers to pay wages to workers through cheque or directly crediting to their accounts. The bill will replace the Ordinance promulgated in December last year. Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said the new law will help in check exploitation of workers in unorganised sector.
