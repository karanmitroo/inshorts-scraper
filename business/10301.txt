The Centre aims to raise as much as ₹5.63 lakh crore from the nation’s biggest ever spectrum auction which begins on September 29. This is also the first time that 700 Mhz airwaves will be put up for auction. The band, which will lower service delivery costs for the operators, can alone fetch bids worth ₹4 lakh crore, reports claimed.
