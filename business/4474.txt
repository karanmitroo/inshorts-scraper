An IT workers’ association termed ex-Infosys director Mohandas Pai's remarks that IT employees will never get jobs if they supported those wanting to forge unions in the industry as "hurting". "[I]t is an open threat to the constitutional rights of the employees,” it stated. Pai had accused people, attempting to make an IT union, of trying to “create a hype”.
