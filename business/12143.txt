State-run Chinese newspaper Global Times on Wednesday published an article dismissing reports about India becoming the “new growth engine of world economy”. The article said that though PM Narendra Modi "has boosted the morale of the Indian economy", his economic reforms have achieved “little progress”. It further asserted that the Chinese economy is five times bigger than the Indian economy.
