The Centre today told the Supreme Court that it cannot give more chances to people to deposit old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. The government reasoned that doing so would defeat the purpose of demonetisation. Earlier, SC had asked the government to consider a final window for people who had genuine reasons for not depositing the notes by end of 2016.
