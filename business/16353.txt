After rising over 150 points in the early trade, the BSE Sensex on Tuesday dipped 195 points down to end at 27,506.46 points. The index fell after poll trends indicated that the Modi-led BJP does not have a clear majority in J&K, but may form a govt in Jharkhand. Similarly, the 50-share Nifty closed 57 points down at 8,267.
