Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Saturday said, ”Money means nothing to me really." "My father used to always tell me that if you start anything just to make money, then...you are a fool," Ambani stated. "You should...know what you want to do, in what you want to be the best, and what you are passionate about," he further added.
