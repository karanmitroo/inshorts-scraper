The European Commission has raised questions over UK's assurance to Nissan about access to EU's market after the Brexit, reports said. This comes after Nissan announced its plans to build two new cars in the UK, thus safeguarding 7,000 jobs after receiving "support and assurances" from the government. Notably, UK is not allowed to provide state aid under EU rules.
