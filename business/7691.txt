Industrialist Ratan Tata has termed demonetisation as one of the most important economic reforms, adding that the "bold" move needs the nation's support. The government's fight against black money needs "support and cooperation of all like minded citizens of India," he said. Earlier, Tata raised concerns over demonetisation, asking the government to consider special relief measures for the poor.
