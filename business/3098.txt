British budget chain Poundland has claimed Toblerone's shape is no longer distinctive enough to be a valid trademark. Poundland made the remarks in legal documents defending its right to launch a copycat bar. Last month, Poundland was forced to delay the launch of its Twin Peaks bar after a legal threat from Toblerone brand's owner Mondelez.
