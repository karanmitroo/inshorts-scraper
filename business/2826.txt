The Finance Ministry on Thursday ruled out opening another window for depositing the scrapped ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. When asked if people can get a second window, Economic Affairs Secretary SC Garg said, "At this point... No way." This comes after the RBI revealed that nearly 99% of the scrapped currency notes had been brought back into the system.
