Germany's second largest airline, Air Berlin, has filed for insolvency after its main shareholder, Etihad Airways, withdrew financial support. However, Air Berlin will continue operating flights with a loan of over $175 million (nearly â‚¹1,130 crore) from the government. This would allow 7,200 employees to keep their jobs while executives try to restructure or sell the company.
