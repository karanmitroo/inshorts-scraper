Gold prices soar by Rs 840 on Tuesday, marking biggest single-day gain of this year. Gold regained the Rs 27,000 per ten gram level after a gap of about one month in the national capital. Rebounds in global markets, pick-up in domestic demand from jewelers and retailers for the wedding season also supported the sentiment.
