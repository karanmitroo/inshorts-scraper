Considering the huge impact of misleading advertisements, the Central Consumer Protection Council (CCPC) Monday decided to set up a sub-committee to suggest strategies to deal with such advertisements. The committee will have the powers to take corrective actions and impose compensation on the advertisers and the celebrities endorsing the product, in case there is a complaint about the product.
