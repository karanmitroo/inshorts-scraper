Infosys is facing flak from shareholders for offering ₹5.90 crore in severance pay to former Executive Vice President (EVP) David Kennedy, who quit on Saturday. Kennedy is the eighth EVP to quit Infosys since Vishal Sikka took over as Infosys' first non-founder CEO in 2014. Earlier in 2015, Infosys faced flak for offering ₹17.38 crore to outgoing CFO Rajiv Bansal.
