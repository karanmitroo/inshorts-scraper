Global benchmark Brent crude on Monday fell by over 2.6% to $32.66 per barrel as China's economic slowdown dented the outlook for demand and traders reportedly are losing faith in market recovery. Oil prices have slumped over 10% since the beginning of 2016 and have fallen over 70% since the downturn began in mid-2014 amid the oversupply of the commodity.
