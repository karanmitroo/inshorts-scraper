The government will engage state-run Power Grid to electrify 1,000-km of rail tracks on a pilot basis, under its plan to energise 35,000 km of unelectrified lines, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said. This will reportedly lower crude imports and ensure faster movement of trains. According to Goyal, electrification of entire rail tracks could raise power consumption by 7 billion units.
