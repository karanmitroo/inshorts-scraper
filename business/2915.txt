The 'Right to Privacy' verdict will have no bearing upon the requirement of tax payers to link their PAN with Aadhaar by this month-end, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey said on Friday. "Linking of PAN to Aadhaar is mandated by an amendment in income tax act...the linking will continue under that act and law. There is no change," said Pandey.
