CPRL administrator Justice GS Singhvi has written to Radhakrishna Foodland, the logistics partner of McDonald's in north and east India, to restore supplies. However, the logistics partner said that it's a contractual matter and doesn't fall in the ambit of administrator's powers. Radhakrishna Foodland had discontinued its services due to which over 80 McDonald's outlets faced closure this week.
