As the growth in smartphone sales faded, the top smartphone selling company Samsung has faced a bigger than expected fall. The net income for Apr-Jun quarter came down 20%, from $7.0 billion last year to $6.1 billion this year. While the sales went down by 9% to $51 billion, profit sank lower at 25% ($7.1bn) due to higher marketing expenses.
