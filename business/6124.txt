The government on Friday cut the tenure of Ajay Tyagi, the next chief of markets regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), by two years. Tyagi will now join as the SEBI Chairman for an initial period of three years, as against 5 years. This comes nearly a week after Tyagi was cleared to succeed incumbent UK Sinha.
