Apple's Japan unit has been reportedly ordered to pay $118 million in taxes to local authorities after the company underreported income. Apple, which sends part of its Japan profits to another Apple unit in Ireland, had not been paying tax on those earnings. Earlier in August, Apple was ordered by the EU to pay $14.6 billion in taxes to Ireland.
