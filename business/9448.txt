India is now the world's third-biggest importer for Scotch whisky, after France and the US, the Scotch Whisky Association stated. The country's Scotch imports rose 28% to £43 million (₹375 crore) in 2016's first six months. Further, the amount of Scotch sold overseas increased for the first time since 2013, mainly due to increasing Indian shipments.
