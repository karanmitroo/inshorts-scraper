Wipro has filed a complaint after receiving an anonymous email threatening an attack if it doesn't pay â‚¹500 crore in bitcoins. Attackers threatened to use a fatal toxin 'ricin'. "It would be used through food served at your cafeteria, disperse it using a flying drone or even on...the toilet paper with which you wipe your ar*e," the email reportedly said.
