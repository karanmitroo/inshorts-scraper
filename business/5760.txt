Walmart-owned supermarket Asda is offering its store staff a 14% rise in hourly pay, if they sign a contract requiring more flexible working. Asda will offer 1,35,000 store staff a base rate of £8.5 an hour, which is £1 above government mandated National Living Wage increase. This would require staff to work on public holidays, and breaks would be unpaid.
