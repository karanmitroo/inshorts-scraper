Former RBI Governor D Subbarao on Friday said there should not be any ‘moral code of conduct’ for the RBI Governor, adding it is not "advisable to compartmentalise" that he only talks about central banking issues. If the Governor is a public intellectual like Rajan, it would be "good, appropriate, and desirable" that he speaks about larger issues, Subbarao added.
