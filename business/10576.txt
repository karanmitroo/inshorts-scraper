Volkswagen CEO Matthias Müller was aware of engineering discussions in 2006 that led to illegal cheat software in company’s US diesel cars, claims the lawsuit filed by New York state officials. While Volkswagen blames lower-level executives, the suit accuses the CEO of involvement in the scam and claims that a 'wilful and systematic scheme of cheating' had been created.
