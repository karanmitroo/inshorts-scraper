US President-elect Donald Trump remains opposed to the $85.4 billion merger between telecom giant AT&T and cable major Time Warner, as it would concentrate too much power in the media industry, reports stated. Trump has told a friend that he still considers the merger a bad deal, reports added. In October, Trump said he would block the deal if elected.
