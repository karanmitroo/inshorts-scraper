Capital markets regulator SEBI on Friday asked the stock exchanges, including the BSE and the NSE, to keep the markets open on Budget day, despite it being a Saturday.  The trading would be conducted during normal hours from 9 AM to 3.30 PM on that day. The stock markets are generally closed on Saturdays and Sundays, except for special circumstances.
