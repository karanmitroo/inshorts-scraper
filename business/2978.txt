The Baltic nation of Estonia is reportedly considering starting its own virtual currency called 'estcoin' to boost its economy. The move is a part of an e-residency programme launched by the country in 2014, under which anyone in the world can become an Estonian digital resident. If implemented, it would be the world's first government-backed initial coin offering (ICO).
