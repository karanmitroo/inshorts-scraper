Alibaba Founder Jack Ma has warned that a retreat from globalisation will lead to trouble, stating, "Everybody is concerned about trade wars. If trade stops, war starts." “But worry doesn't solve the problem. The only thing you can do is...actively prove that trade helps people to communicate,” Ma said. "[W]e should have fair trade, transparent trade, inclusive trade,” he added.
