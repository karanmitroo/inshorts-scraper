Jet Airways has decided to freeze pay hike of its senior employees at the managerial level and above, including pilots, for this fiscal, according to reports. The airline, in an email, said the move is in line with an immediate need to stabilise employee cost. "We understand that these measures are difficult and unsettling, but are unavoidable," the airline said.
