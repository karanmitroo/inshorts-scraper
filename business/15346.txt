The Sci-fi obsessed Muti-millionaire Chinese business tycoon, Liu Dejian, has reportedly spent nearly £100 million to make his company headquarters look like the Star Trek spaceship, Enterprise. The building, whose construction began in 2008, has 30-feet-long metal slides between levels, and automatic sliding gates. Dejian is the chairman of China’s most popular internet provider, NetDragon Websoft.
