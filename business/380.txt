Remington Outdoor, the 202-year-old US gunmaker, has said it would file for bankruptcy protection amid declining sales. This will let Remington stay in business while it undergoes restructuring to pay off its creditors. The company currently employs 3,500 people and is among the largest US manufacturers of ammunition and firearms.
