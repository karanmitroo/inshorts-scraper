Deutsche Bank has banned text messages and other communication apps like WhatsApp, Google Talk and iMessage on company-issued phones. The policy, which also applies to personal phones used for work purposes, will become applicable from this quarter. The bank said the move will "ensure Deutsche Bank continues to comply with regulatory and legal requirements."
