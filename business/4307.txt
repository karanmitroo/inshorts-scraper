The Bombay High Court on Friday restrained popular brand Amul from telecasting advertisements found to be disparaging of frozen desserts of Hindustan Unilever (HUL). HUL had filed a suit in March 2017, stating that Amul's advertisements harmed its Kwality Wall's brand. HUL's suit claimed that Amul's ad was misleading and spread false and malicious information about frozen desserts.
