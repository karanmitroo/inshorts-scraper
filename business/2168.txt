Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said "there is a strong case" to bring real estate under the ambit of GST. "The one sector in India where maximum amount of tax evasion and cash generation takes place...is real estate," he said. He added the move would benefit consumers, who will only have to pay one "final tax" on the whole product.
