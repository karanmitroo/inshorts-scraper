Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has sued two vendors for $2,02,000 alleging that they used the company's online shopping website Taobao for selling fake Swarovski watches. This is the first time that a Chinese e-commerce company has taken action against sellers of counterfeit goods. The Taobao website was put on a US trade agency's fake goods blacklist last month.
