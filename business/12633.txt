Gold prices on Saturday broke their 11-day rising streak to slip from a 21-month high on weak global cues amid a fall in demand from jewellers. Prices of gold in Delhi fell by ₹600 to ₹29,050 (99.9% purity) and ₹28,900 (99.5%) per ten grams. Gold prices gained ₹2,600 in the previous 11 days, largely backed up by firming trend overseas.
