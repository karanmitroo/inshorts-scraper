Global e-commerce marketplace Groupon has laid off 39 people from its flash sale unit, Ideel. The company had acquired the fashion site, then known as Ideeli, for $43 million in a fire sale in 2014. Earlier this week, Groupon cut 20 positions inside its Breadcrumb unit, which sells software that restaurants use to accept payments and manage their businesses.
