A union representing pilots who fly products for e-commerce major Amazon ran digital advertisements on Friday that suggest delays in holiday gifts' delivery. The ads, ran on Facebook and Google, link to a site called "Can Amazon Deliver?", warning customers of staffing problems. "This holiday season, Amazon customers may want to think twice before ordering last-minute deliveries," the site said.
