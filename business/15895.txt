Hero MotoCorp Ltd promoter Brijmohan Lall Munjal Wednesday divested 4% stake in the company by selling seven million equity shares. Following the sale, the Hero Group still holds a significant stake of over 36% in the company. “The group will use the sale proceeds to fund new growth avenues available through the Government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative,” the company said.
