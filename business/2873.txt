United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz is pledging as much as $1 million of his own money to match donations to the company's employee-relief fund in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. "I will personally match your contributions dollar-for-dollar up to $1 million," Munoz told employees. At least 30 people have died after Hurricane Harvey made a landfall in United States' Texas.
