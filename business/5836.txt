The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, in a new tariff order, asked every distributor of channels to declare retail price of each pay channel and bouquet of pay channels payable by a subscriber. This has been done to bring in "transparency... consumer protection... clarity and non-discrimination," TRAI said. The regulator has also notified interconnection and service quality orders.
