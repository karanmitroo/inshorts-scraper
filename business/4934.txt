SBI has declined to share the quantum of money lying in suspended bank accounts in which interest amount of customers, who don't claim it due to religious reasons, is kept. The bank was asked to provide details of suspended accounts, and was also asked to share guidelines to deal with such interest amount. SBI said it doesn't maintain such information.
