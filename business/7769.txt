Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said that exporters have demanded an increase in the withdrawal limit from ₹50,000 a week to up to ₹5 lakh. In labour-intensive sectors like carpet and handloom, working is dependent on cash withdrawal, she said. Further, “I will definitely draw the attention of the Finance Minister on the cash withdrawal limit,” she added.
