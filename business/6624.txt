Former RBI Governor D Subbarao has said that demonetisation would be like a search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq if the tax-to-GDP ratio does not improve by at least 1%. The government and the RBI confused the people as there was inadequate communication post the note ban, he added. There could have been greater preparedness, Subbarao further stated.
