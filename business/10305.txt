State-owned ONGC "over-reported" its oil production by over 12% (6 million tonnes) leading to the spending of ₹18,787 crore in excess subsidy from 2011 to 2015, government auditor CAG said on Monday. He added that partially stabilised crude oil was reported as crude oil production for around 3 years. He said the extra money spent included performance-related pay for ONGC executives.
