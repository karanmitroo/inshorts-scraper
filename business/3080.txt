Cyrus and Shapoor Mistry-led Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group has claimed that it would not be affected by the Tata Group snapping all business ties with it. The group said it gives more business to the Tata group than it gets from the latter. Notably, Cyrus Mistry was removed as Tata Sons Chairman in October last year.
