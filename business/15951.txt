According to recent recalculations by India's statistics ministry, India has surpassed China as the country with the fastest-growing economy. India's growth in the last two quarters has been 7.5% and 8.2%. China's economic growth, on the other hand, has slowed down with a GDP expansion of 7.3% in both quarters. However, China's economy remains much larger than India's.
