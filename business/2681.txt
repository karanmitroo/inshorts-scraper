Vikram Bakshi, McDonald's India's estranged partner, has said that CPRL-run 169 outlets in north and east India will continue to operate under McDonald's brand. NCLAT has refused interim relief to Bakshi on his plea against termination of franchise agreement by McDonald's. Following this, McDonald's said it would enforce its legal right to refrain Bakshi from using its intellectual property.
