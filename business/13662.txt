Tesla Motors on Friday announced its highest-ever recall of all the 90,000 Model S cars after a report in Europe found that the "front seat belt was not properly connected". "[I]n the event of a crash, a seat belt in this condition would not provide full protection", Tesla said. The delivery of the Model S cars began in June 2012.
