NDTV on Friday reported a loophole that allowed online access to ICICI bank account monthly statements of other customers using very basic information about their accounts. Later, the bank said in a statement, "The bank has robust systems to ensure the highest standards of privacy of customers' data. We will investigate the said report and take appropriate actions if required."
