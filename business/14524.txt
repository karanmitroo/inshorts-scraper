India's Current Account Deficit narrowed to 1.2% of its Gross Domestic Product ($6.2 billion) in Quarter 1 of the current fiscal year, compared to 1.6% in the same quarter a year ago. However, the CAD rose substantially quarter-on-quarter, when compared to the previous quarter's $1.3 billion (0.2% of GDP). Analysts at ratings agency CRISIL predicted the CAD would narrow further.
