Chipmaker Broadcom plans to raise its hostile takeover offer for its rival Qualcomm to about $145 billion from $130 billion including debt, according to reports. Qualcomm had rejected the initial bid, saying it "dramatically undervalues" the company. This comes ahead of the Qualcomm shareholder meeting scheduled for March 6, where Broadcom is seeking to replace Qualcomm's board of directors.
