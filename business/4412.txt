Lupin Pharmaceuticals has recalled widely-distributed birth control pills over a packaging error that the US drug regulator warned could lead to unintended pregnancy. The Mibelas 24 Fe pills were packaged in the wrong order, meaning the first four pills were non-hormonal placebos rather than the active tablets. Pills taken out of sequence could place the user at contraceptive failure risk.
