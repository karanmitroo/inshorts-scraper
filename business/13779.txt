Japan's current account surplus widened for the 15th-straight month in September as weak global oil prices and a weak yen boosted the earnings from overseas. Japan's finance ministry on Tuesday reported a $11.9 billion excess reserve (1.5 trillion yen). Meanwhile, according to Japan National Tourism Organisation, number of foreign visitors surged 47% to 1.61 million in September from last year.
