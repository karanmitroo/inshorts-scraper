Color of Change, a non-profit racial justice group, is putting pressure on PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi to step down from US President Donald Trump's advisory council. This came after Trump was slow to condemn white-supremacist violence last week in Virginia. "Their role on this business council is that of an enabler...to Donald Trump," said the group's executive director Rashad Robinson.
