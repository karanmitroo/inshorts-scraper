Former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Raghuram Rajan has revealed that he was not "asked to make a decision on demonetisation... at [any] point during [his] term at the bank." "Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them", he revealed in his book 'I do what I do'.
