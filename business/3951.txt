Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that before GST, the nation was only politically integrated and not economically but now there is tax uniformity across states. "With the new tax regime, things will be simplified," Jaitley said. He also said that Congress, which supported the entire journey of GST, was 'nervous' towards the end.
