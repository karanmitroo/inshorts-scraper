As per Britain's office for national statistics, for the first time in 55 years, the country slipped into deflation in 2015. The consumer price index, the official measure of inflation, fell from 0% in March to -0.1% in April this year. The negative reading of the CPI was a result of falling costs of travel, particularly air and sea transport.
