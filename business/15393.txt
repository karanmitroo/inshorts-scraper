Honda Cars India will launch its third generation premium hatchback Jazz in India on July 8. The car will come with both petrol and diesel options and will have the same 1.5 litre i-DTEC and 1 litre i-VTEC engines as in Honda's Amaze sedan. It will compete with Hyundai's popular high selling car i20, which has a long waiting period.
