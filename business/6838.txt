State Bank of India Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya at an event held recently said, "While demonetisation has indeed given a huge push to the digital economy, I donâ€™t really believe that India can be a cashless economy". She added, "I always say that we will be a less-cash economy - that is a more reasonable goal to work towards".
