United Airlines has been sued by a passenger claiming she was forced out from her business-class seat to the rear of the plane without an explanation in September. The passenger is seeking $150,000 (over â‚¹96 lakh) in punitive damages "to deter such behaviour in the future". Earlier, a passenger was dragged off a United flight to make room for employees.
