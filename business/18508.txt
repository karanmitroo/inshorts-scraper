Amazon.in unveiled the Amazon Associates in India- an advertising program which lets online publishers earn a percentage-based referral fee when visitors click through a link of contextually relevant product and visit Amazon.in to make a purchase. The commission extends to all Amazon products the customer buys and not just the specific product that was advertised.
