In an attempt to curb illegal mining in the country, mines in Tamil Nadu have been digitised and mapped in a database, reports said. The Mining Surveillance System (MSS) was recently launched by the government to check the exploitation of natural resources by using remote sensing satellites. MSS generates illegal mining triggers which are automatically sent to state governments.
