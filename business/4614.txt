About 40% of ayurveda products including items from Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali, were found to be of substandard quality by Haridwar’s Ayurveda and Unani Office, an RTI reply revealed. Out of 82 samples collected between 2013-2016, 32 including Patanjali’s Divya Amla Juice and Shivlingi Beej, failed the test, Uttarakhand government's lab report said. Patanjali MD Acharya Balkrishna denied the report.
