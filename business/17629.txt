Shares of London-based King Digital Entertainment fell to $19.08 from $22.50 in their Wednesday IPO debut -the largest by a gaming company since Zynga went public in 2011. The company, valued at $6 billion in its IPO debut, offers 180 games but its two-year-old 'Candy Crush Saga' game, which has 500 million downloads, accounted for three-quarters of King's recent revenue.
