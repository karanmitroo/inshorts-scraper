Export sales from China in March fell 15% when compared to last year, the worst monthly fall in 12 months. The fall has raised concerns about China's economic growth and how the rising value of their currency Yuan has hurt demand for Chinese products in the international markets. Domestic demand in China also slowed as imports fell 12.7% in March.
