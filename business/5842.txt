Nestlé has announced plans to cut 10% of the sugar from its confectionery in the UK and Ireland by 2018. The cut, which will amount to 7,500 tonnes, follows concerns over rising obesity levels and Britain urging manufacturers to reduce sugar levels in food. Nestlé said it will replace sugar with larger quantities of existing ingredients instead of artificial sweeteners.
