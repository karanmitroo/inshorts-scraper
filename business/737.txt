Chairman of Japanese conglomerate Hitachi has called India's bullet train project a "big challenge" as the government has requested the company to make local manufacturing capabilities. He said the company's "most important project" in the South Asian region is India's first bullet train line. Notably, the foundation stone for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor was laid in September 2017.
