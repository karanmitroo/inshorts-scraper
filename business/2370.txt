In an attempt to reduce tobacco abuse, the Health Ministry has proposed to ban the sale of non-tobacco products such as candies and colas at retail shops selling tobacco products such as cigarettes and gutka. The ministry has also written to state governments asking them to develop a mechanism to authorise shops selling tobacco products through municipal authorities.
