United Airlines, which has been linked to dragging a passenger, was trolled on Twitter after it offered a free flight to a teen who won free nuggets from Wendy's after achieving the most retweets ever. "Why are you threatening?" a user posted, while another said, "They will take your nuggs to feed their victims." "It's a trap," another user posted.
