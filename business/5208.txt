Delhi Police has busted a module that sold information including bank account details and card details of over 1 crore people. Police have arrested an accused in the case, who allegedly sold this data at about 20 paisa per individual. The data was sold to fake call centres, which would use it to obtain victims' one-time passwords to steal money.
