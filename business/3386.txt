The Department of Pharmaceuticals is reportedly planning to restrict gifts and trips offered to doctors and pharmacists to â‚¹1,000. The rules would allow drugmakers to sponsor trips for doctors, pharmacists and relatives to attend medical seminars. To ensure implementation of the rules, an 'Ethics Compliance Officer' of the rank of joint secretary to the Indian government would be appointed.
