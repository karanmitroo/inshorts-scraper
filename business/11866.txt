Business conglomerate ITC on Friday said that it will "soon" resume manufacturing of cigarettes at its factories after a High court order was passed in its favour. The firm had stopped manufacturing activities on April 1 over a government notification prescribing larger pictorial warning covering 85% of tobacco product packets, saying there was a lack of clarity in the policy.
