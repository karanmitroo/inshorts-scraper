US-listed Johnson Controls and Tyco International are merging in a deal that will value the combined company at over $30 billion. The deal would result in lower costs and more opportunities for cross-selling between the companies. Johnson will assume Tycoâ€™s Irish tax domicile, which gives it a significant tax break. Tax law continues to encourage US companies to move overseas.
