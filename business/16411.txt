The Sensex as well as Nifty hit their lowest in 1-1/2 months on Monday, pulled lower by losses in shares of software providers. The IT sector came under pressure following TCSâ€™ tepid comments on its outlook and due to global risk aversion. The Sensex ended 0.11% lower at 27,319.56, while the Nifty settled 0.05% lower at 8,219.60.
