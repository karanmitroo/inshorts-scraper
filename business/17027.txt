A former Facebook employee, Noah Kagan, has reportedly claimed in his new book that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg used to threaten to behead under-performing staff with a Japanese samurai sword. Kagan, in the book 'How I Lost 170 million dollars', said that it was part of Zuckerberg's "immature" management style when he started out aged 23.
