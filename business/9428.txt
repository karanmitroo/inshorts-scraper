British car manufacturing company Rolls-Royce is cutting more than 200 management jobs as a part of its ongoing restructuring. The restructuring is a part of CEO Warren East's turnaround programme announced last year, to save $195-$260 million a year by 2017. The company in January announced cutting a few dozen senior management jobs and cut another 150 positions in March.
