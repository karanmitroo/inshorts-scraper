RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Monday that RBI's projection of GDP for the current fiscal remains unchanged at 7.4% after the economy recovered in the second quarter. Weak rural and external demand are holding back overall growth, he added. Data suggested that India overtook China as the worldâ€™s fastest growing major economy in the July-September quarter.
