The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed the Employees Compensation (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides for the payment of higher compensation of ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh to employees and their kin in an event of injury by industrial accidents, including occupational diseases. The bill also provides for a hefty penalty in case of an employer violation, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said.
