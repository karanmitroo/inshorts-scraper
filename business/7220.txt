Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry has said that he will take his fight against his sudden removal from the group to the nation's courts. Mistry, who earlier resigned as a director from Tata companies, said he is fighting for better transparency at the Tata group. "My fight will actually continue, and not only continue, it will strengthen," Mistry stated.
