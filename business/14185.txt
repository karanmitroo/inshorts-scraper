Aditya Birla Group on Friday launched an e-commerce fashion store ‘abof’ (Aditya Birla Online Fashion), equipped with India’s first-of-its-kind 3D virtual trial room. The store, offering products from external brands as well as its own private label, would be “staying away from deep discounts”. Aditya Birla Group is the country's largest fashion retailer with ₹5,290 crore in annual sales.
