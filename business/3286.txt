Sahara Group moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking to push back the publication of the sale notice for its Pune-based township Aamby Valley. The value of the property is reportedly estimated at over ₹40,000 crore. Notably, SEBI moved SC in August 2014 to recover ₹36,000 crore from Sahara to return to investors, of which ₹16,000 crore has been paid.
