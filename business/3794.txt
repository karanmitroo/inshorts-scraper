Air Zimbabwe has fired 200 employees, which is nearly half of its workforce, in order to save the airline's viability. "The organisation is over-bloated," Chairman Chipo Dyanda said. Affected workers were sent on paid leave and will receive three months' salary and compensation for loss of employment. Notably, the state-run airline has over $300 million (over â‚¹1,900 crore) in debt.
