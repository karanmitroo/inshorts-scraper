Pakistan Senate has passed a resolution seeking withdrawal of Rs 5,000 currency notes to curb the flow of black money, according to local media. The move is expected to encourage the use of bank accounts and reduce the size of unaccounted economy. This comes after India demonetised ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes to crack down on black money and tax evaders.
