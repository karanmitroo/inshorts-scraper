The US benchmark index S&P 500 on Monday surged to a record high in about 14 months. Further, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ posted a near 14-month and six-month high respectively. Investors remained buoyant following Friday's robust monthly jobs report amid the US Federal Reserve's easy-money policies and bond yields touching historic lows, analysts said.
