Greece's PM Alexis Tsipras has vowed to not pass any new austerity measures before a meeting of Euro-area Finance Ministers to unblock the country's bailout review. Tsipras said he is not going to "legislate even one euro more than what was agreed in the bailout" while adding that demand for more austerity measures is not in line with democratic norms.
