Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis described the country's 86 billion-euro bailout deal as ‘a new Versailles Treaty’, referring to the treaty which forced severe reparations on Germany after World War I. "This has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greece on the way to recovery. This is a new Versailles treaty..." Varoufakis said.
