BJP President Amit Shah Saturday said even though bringing back black money is a complex issue, the government has disclosed 700 names to the SIT. It is not alone in the hands of India to bring back black money, as several international treaties are coming in the way, Shah said. He added BJP will succeed in giving punishment to offenders.
