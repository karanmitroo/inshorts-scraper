Ex-billionaire Vijay Mallya is living on a weekly allowance of ₹4.5 lakh after a UK court's order of freezing his assets. Mallya's request to increase his weekly allowance to ₹18 lakh was adjourned by his lawyers. While Mallya's extradition trial began at London court on Monday, his lawyers are trying to overturn a $1.5 billion worldwide freezing order against him.
