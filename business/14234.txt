Oil refiner and retailer Indian Oil Corporation is planning an expenditure of almost Rs 32,500 crore on exploration and production. Half of the planned amount is to be used for acquisition of new assets. "We will participate in auctions overseas. We also intend to participate in the NELP (domestic auction of hydrocarbon blocks) when it happens," IOC's director (finance) said.
