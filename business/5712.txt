Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej has said that GST will check tax evasion and reduce unaccounted money in the system, adding that it's now "pay taxes or get out". Once the GST framework is in place, things will change for the better, he added. Commenting on demonetisation, Godrej said whenever a government has tried to control things, it has failed.
