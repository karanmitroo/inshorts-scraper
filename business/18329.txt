Rupee showed a gain of 2.76% in the last week, its best weekly-gain in the last 15-months. With a marginal hike, rupee closed at Rs.63.49/dollar on Friday, but the vulnerability of the recovery is still there as India suffers from both a large current account deficit and a fiscal gap. Also, domestic concerns persist, with growth outlook still remaining muddled.
