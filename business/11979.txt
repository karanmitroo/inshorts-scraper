The Union Cabinet on Wednesday allowed states to relax the existing cap on fiscal deficit of 3% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) by an additional 0.5%. However, only those states that have a debt-GSDP ratio of under 25% and interest payments-revenue receipts ratio of under 10% in the previous two years will be eligible to raise their fiscal deficits.
