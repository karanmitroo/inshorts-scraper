Qatar-based natural gas company 'Rasgas' has reportedly agreed to drop a $1 billion penalty on government-owned Petronet LNG Ltd levied for buying only 68% of the 7.5 million tonnes of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) contracted. State-owned companies who have agreed to buy LNG from Petronet have bought it from the open market instead owing to a fall in global prices.
