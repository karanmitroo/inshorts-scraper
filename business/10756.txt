The Ministry of Civil Aviation on Friday unveiled the draft Regional Connectivity Scheme, which was proposed in the recently approved Civil Aviation Policy. Under the scheme, airfares will be capped at â‚¹2,500 for one-hour flights on unserved and under-served routes. Funding for the scheme would be done through a "levy on certain flights", which can reportedly cause an airfare hike.
