Singapore Airlines is reviewing its policy of serving nuts onboard after a three-year-old toddler suffered a severe allergic reaction when fellow passengers opened their packets of peanuts. Marcus Daley went into a potentially life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis before he was given anti-allergy medication. Following the incident, the crew removed all packets of peanuts from the area.
