Yoga guru Baba Ramdev filed an injunction against the sale or printing of Priyanka Pathak-Narain's book 'Godman To Tycoon: The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev', alleging that its contents were defamatory. A Delhi court issued the injunction without hearing the publisher, Juggernaut. The book traces the early days and rise of Ramdev, who is now the face of Patanjali.
