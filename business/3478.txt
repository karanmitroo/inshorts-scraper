Capita, one of the UK’s largest outsourcing companies, has demanded up to £21,000 (₹17.7 lakh) from graduates who tried to leave an unpaid training scheme. Former trainees said the training lacked any on-the-job experience and called it “absolutely useless”. Capita has said participants were made fully aware that free training is provided to only those who successfully complete the course.
