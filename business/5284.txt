United Airlines sparked outrage on Monday after a passenger was physically dragged off an overbooked flight. Videos show officers yanking the passenger from his seat and dragging him while he bleeds and his body is limp. The man reportedly told the staff he is a doctor who had to reach his patients, while United claimed its employees needed extra seats.
