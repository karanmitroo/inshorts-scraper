Wipro Chairman Azim Premji was the first Indian to join 'The Giving Pledge', an initiative by Bill and Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffett to inspire wealthy people to donate their wealth for charity. Premji, who turns 71 on Sunday, donated half of his Wipro stake, worth over $7 billion. The only other resident Indian on the list is Biocon's Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.
