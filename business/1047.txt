Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra tweeted a video of a man on a bike transporting multiple packs of banana stems out of a field using a conveyor belt-type system and called it 'Kela-Konveyor'. After Mahindra called it a "commendable exercise in jugaad", Twitter users suggested that the innovation should be called 'plantrain', 'kelavator', 'kelgaadi' or "BETRO- Bike, Banana, Metro".
