Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to re-launch a scheme to encourage Dalit entrepreneurs' participation in service and manufacturing sectors. The scheme, named after BR Ambedkar, reserves 20% plots for small and medium scale industries with Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation for Dalits. The policy is only limited to industries with 100% investment from SC/ST people.
