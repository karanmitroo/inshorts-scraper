Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' net worth has dropped $8.1 billion since he briefly took over Bill Gates as world's richest man two weeks ago. The drop is attributed to Amazon's falling stock price that has plunged 10% since hitting a record high last month. Bezos is currently the world's third richest person with an estimated net worth of $82.5 billion.
