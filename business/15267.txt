Fast-food chain McDonald’s is planning a 100% expansion in its outlets in South and West India in the next 3-5 years. There are currently 209 restaurants in the regions. The first restaurant in South India reportedly opened in 2006, 10 years after Mumbai. Seeing the high demand for chicken in South India, McDonald’s will introduce chicken wings to its menu.
