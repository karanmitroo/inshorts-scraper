Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings has forecasted a "relatively high quality [and] steroid-free" GDP growth of 8% for India over the next few years. This would be backed by a broadening consumption base, the agency stated. However, inflation remains a risk, given the large weights on food, fuel, and other volatile items in the RBI's target basket, S&P added.
