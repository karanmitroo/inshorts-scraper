Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian on Thursday said that the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the "mother of all achievements". "We should aspire for a simple structure for GST with lower rates," he stated. Further, there may be the risk of missing a self-imposed deadline to launch the GST regime from April 2017, Subramanian added.
