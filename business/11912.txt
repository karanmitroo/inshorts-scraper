The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has warned that it may cut its oil demand forecast due to slowing economic expansion in emerging markets, and removal of fuel subsidies. “Economic developments in Latin America and China are of concern,” OPEC reported. This comes ahead of an OPEC meeting aimed at finalising an accord to deal with global crude surplus.
