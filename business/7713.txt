Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday said that demonetisation of high-value currency notes could cause the GDP of India to shrink by 2% because of the way it has been implemented. Calling the move a ‘monumental mismanagement’, Singh stated that it was in fact, a case of "organised loot" and "legalised plunder" of the common people.
