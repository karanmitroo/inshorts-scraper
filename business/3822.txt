Japanese carmaker Honda has recalled 12 lakh Accord midsize cars in the US over fears that a battery sensor can short out and potentially cause a fire. The recall covers cars from the 2013 through 2016 model years. The recall was made after Honda received four reports of engine compartment fires due to the problem.
