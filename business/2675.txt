Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said he would have resigned if the demonetisation decision was thrust on him. "It (demonetisation) happened in 1978. Government brought in demonetisation through an ordinance. The government can completely bypass the RBI," he said. He also revealed that he never resigned from the RBI post but had to step down as his term ended.
