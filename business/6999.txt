Steve Jobs had invested $5 million in animation film studio Pixar after he had left Apple in 1985, and became a billionaire for the first time when Pixar went public in 1995. Jobs later sold Pixar to the Walt Disney Company in 2006 for over $7 billion and became Disney's largest individual shareholder with a 7% stake.
