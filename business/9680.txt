The Telecom Department on Monday issued new guidelines on SIM upgradations from 2G to 3G or 4G, effective September 1. Telecom operators would now be allowed to upgrade a SIM only if a customer requests for it. Subscribers will have to send a request through customer care, online platforms or a firm's point of sale to get their SIM upgraded.
