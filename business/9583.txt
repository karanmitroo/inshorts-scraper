To ensure its involvement at every stage of defence manufacturing, the Indian Army has set up the Army Design Bureau (ADB). It will be an interface between the Army and the DRDO, academia, defence PSUs, and the private industry. This aims to achieve the Army's modernisation and indigenisation programme, in line with the Centre's ‘Make in India’ plan.
