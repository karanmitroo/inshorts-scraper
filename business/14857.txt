The BSE Sensex on Friday closed with a gain of 409 points at 28,114.56 as shares of banking companies posted healthy gains. The positive sentiment was helped by ICICI Bank's strong first quarter results and the government's plan to infuse Rs 70,000 crore in PSBs over four years. The broader Nifty index finished at about 8,533, gaining 111 points.
