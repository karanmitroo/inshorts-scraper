US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday warned companies that plan to leave the US that there will be "consequences" for doing so. "It's simply not going to happen," he added. This comes after air conditioning manufacturer Carrier Corp agreed to drop its plan of moving its Indianapolis plant to Mexico in exchange for tax incentives after negotiations with Trump's team.
