Hindustan Unilever, the maker of Kwality Wall's frozen desserts, said Amul cannot allege that frozen desserts use hydrogenated vegetable oil or vanaspati, unless it can show all frozen dessert manufacturers use it as an ingredient. HUL has sued Amul over its advertisements that emphasise the difference between ice-creams and frozen desserts. HUL said it "harmed" the Kwality Wall's brand.
