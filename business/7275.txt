The Finance Ministry has said double counting could have led to RBI's figure of ₹12.44 lakh crore worth of old notes deposited by December 10, indicating the actual figure could be lower. "There are lot of areas where there could be double counting. We have identified those areas and the data is being sanitised,” Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said.
