Hot Yoga founder Bikram Choudhury owned 43 luxury cars that have gone missing after he lost a sexual harassment case filed by his former legal adviser Minakshi Jafa-Bodden. A US court directed Choudhury to give up the cars, which included 13 Rolls-Royces and eight Bentleys, to Minakshi. He was also ordered to give up his income to pay for damages.
