Billionaire and founder of GoDaddy Bob Parsons announced on Friday that he plans to give $1.3 million in additional bonuses to his employees after the US passed a new tax bill. The money will go to 725 employees at YAM Worldwide, a Parsons-owned holding company. The new tax legislation permanently cuts the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
