A group of Google employees has been running an email since last October that lets other employees anonymously submit complaints against bias and harassment. Over 15,000 employees have subscribed to the email list called 'Yes, at Google', through which these complaints are brought to notice. Google management says it is aware of the email and takes the concerns raised seriously.
