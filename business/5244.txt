After videos of a passenger being dragged off a United Airlines flight for being overbooked surfaced online, CEO Oscar Munoz has admitted that the flight was not technically overbooked. The four airline employees who needed the seats, were not fare-paying passengers, therefore not "booked". Munoz has apologised for the incident, stating, "I continue to be disturbed by what happened."
