The Sensex and Nifty Friday hit record highs owing to the sharp fall in Brent crude price. The Sensex climbed over 350 points to 28,808.45, while the 50-share Nifty gained over 100 points to reach 8,614.10. Falling global crude oil prices and ease in inflation has created hopes of a rate cut by RBI at its December's monetary policy review.
