Fox News host Eric Bolling has been accused of sending 'unsolicited sex texts' to female colleagues. Women who worked with him revealed that he sent them inappropriate pictures and lewd texts. His attorney, however, said, "Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications." Earlier, former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes had resigned following sexual harassment allegations against him.
