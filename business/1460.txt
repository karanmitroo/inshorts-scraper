Microsoft Co-founder Bill Gates has said that detained Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has been an "important partner" in charitable work worldwide. "We've worked together to help stop the spread of polio, measles, and other preventable diseases. His commitment to philanthropy is inspiring," Gates added. Alwaleed was arrested as part of the Kingdom's anti-corruption drive this month.
