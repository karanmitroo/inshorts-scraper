Passenger train fares may go up after the Finance Ministry rejected a Railway Ministry proposal to completely finance a safety fund, reports said. Earlier, the Railways had sought â‚¹1.19 lakh crore from the Finance Ministry to create the fund for undertaking safety works. However, the latter agreed to provide only 25% funds and suggested the Railways to raise the rest.
