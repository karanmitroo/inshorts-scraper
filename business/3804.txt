A scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology was arrested on charges of insider trading. Fei Yan, 31, was accused of trading on inside information about Sibanye Gold's planned $2.2 billion takeover of Stillwater Mining. Yan, who made profits from Stillwater's stock using an account in his mother's name, conducted online research about insider trading shortly before the deal's announcement.
