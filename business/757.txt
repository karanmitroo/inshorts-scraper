The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said that the US is the real threat to global trade. This comes after US President Donald Trump's administration said that the country "erred" in backing China's entry to the World Trade Organisation in 2001. The Ministry further said that China has strictly adhered to the WTO's rules since it joined the trade body.
