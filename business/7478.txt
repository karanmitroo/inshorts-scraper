Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry on Monday said the government has an “inherent obligation” to “remedy and repair breakdown” in the governance of Tata Trusts, the major shareholder of Tata Sons. He alleged that there was absence of appropriate structure and ethical behaviour of trustees. "The governance of Tata Trusts has to become more accountable, transparent," he stated.
