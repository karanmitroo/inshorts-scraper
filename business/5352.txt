Over 300 passengers of a Kochi-Jeddah Air India flight staged a protest on Thursday after their flight was delayed by over 24 hours. It was scheduled to depart the previous evening but passengers were asked to deplane for the second day on Thursday. Air India said the flight, which departed later that day, was delayed due to a technical glitch.
