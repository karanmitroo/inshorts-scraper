Oil prices fell on Friday as the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 12 to 640, after 29 consecutive weeks of decline. Brent crude oil prices fell a further $1.74 cents after losing $1.58 the day before to $60.33/barrel. The Greek economic crisis and China's investigation into suspected stock market manipulation also affected investor sentiment.
