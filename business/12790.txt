Moody's Investors Service on Monday estimated green bonds (which fund projects with environmental benefits) to raise $50 billion globally in 2016, up from $42.4 billion last year. The credit ratings agency cited "momentum from the UN Conference on Climate Change" in Paris in 2015 and "regulatory encouragement" among the factors that are likely to motivate the issuance of the bonds.
