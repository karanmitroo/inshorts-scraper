The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) pulled up Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Airtel, Amazon, Dabur and others for misleading ads in August. It upheld 114 of the 193 complaints received for the month. ASCI held that Dabur's Odomos ad was misleading as its claims weren't substantiated and also pulled up HUL's Fair and Lovely ad which claimed '100% marks reduction'.
