Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved is likely to partner with eight leading e-tailers including Amazon, Flipkart, and Paytm Mall, to push the online sale of its FMCG products. These partnerships will be in addition to its online portal 'patanjaliayurved.net'. Patanjali had earlier announced that it is planning to launch 'swadeshi' line of clothing for women, men, and children by April 2018.
