Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft on Friday said its computers had been used for unauthorized mining of the cryptocurrency Monero. A company spokesperson said the software for mining was automatically downloaded from the web by a Transneft computer and then deleted. Notably, Monero is the tenth-largest virtual currency with a market capitalisation of over $5.4 billion.
