The Reserve Bank of India has appealed public not to use banknotes for making garlands, worshiping gods or for showering on personalities in social events, etc. as these deface the banknotes and shorten their life and urged the public to contribute to its efforts in pursuing a "clean note policy". In past too, the RBI had made a similar appeal.
