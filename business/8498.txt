Amid demands for the resignation of Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif over his alleged involvement in money laundering, IMF chief Christine Lagarde on Wednesday said that the "Panama Papers" leak is a matter of "honesty and transparency". Notably, this comes after various petitions were filed against Sharif after the "Panama papers" revealed that his kin owned offshore accounts in tax havens.
