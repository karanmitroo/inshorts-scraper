Japanese carmaker Honda has agreed to pay $24 million to settle claims of racial discrimination, made by US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Department of Justice. The US regulators claimed that the company charged African American and Hispanic owners higher interest rates on car loans. Regulators found that they paid on average $250 more than white customers.
