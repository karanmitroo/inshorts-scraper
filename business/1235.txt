Cellular operators' body COAI has said the extension of deadline for linking Aadhaar with mobile connections provides an immediate relief to both telecom operators and consumers. COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said the telcos were facing challenges in complying with the earlier deadline given the volume of subscribers. The SC on Friday extended all Aadhaar-linking deadlines to March 31, 2018.
