IndiGo has grounded at least nine A320 neo planes due to problems in their engines, the airline said. "Both Pratt & Whitney and Airbus are working to address the issues," IndiGo added. Notably, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had earlier asked P&W to fix the A320 neo planes' engines flown by Indian carriers within a specified period of time.
