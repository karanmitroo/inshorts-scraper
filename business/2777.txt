High-end department store John Lewis faced social media backlash after it removed 'boys' and 'girls' labels from its children's clothing range. A Facebook user wrote, "Your bowing to politically correct nonsense over children's clothes labelling is ridiculous." Notably, the chain said it was introducing new genderless labels in order to avoid 'reinforcing gender stereotypes'.
