Etihad Airways on Thursday posted a $1.87 billion (nearly â‚¹12,000 crore) loss for 2016, citing "one-off" impairments on aircraft and investments in Alitalia and airberlin. The loss was equivalent to nearly 40% of Etihad's passenger revenue and over 20% of its overall revenue of $8.36 billion. "A culmination of factors contributed to the disappointing results for 2016," Etihad said.
