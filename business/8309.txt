The government has issued a $1.55 billion penalty on private explorer Reliance Industries and its foreign partners BP and Niko Resources for taking natural gas that belonged to state-run ONGC. The Petroleum Ministry reportedly issued a notice to Reliance, asking it to respond within 30 days. Earlier, reports claimed natural gas worth ₹11,000 crore migrated to RIL from ONGC’s fields.
