Shares of Snapchat's parent company Snap fell over 6% on Thursday, wiping out $1.3 billion in market value after Kylie Jenner tweeted she doesn't use the photo-sharing app anymore. This comes amid users' criticism over the redesign of Snapchat's layout.  Jenner, who has 24.5 million followers on Twitter earlier said, "I don't know how i feel about" the "new Snapchat".
