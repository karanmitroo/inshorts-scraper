A PIL seeking a court-monitored CBI probe, into various land deals allegedly by Robert Vadra's firms, was dismissed by the Delhi high court Tuesday. Earlier, the court had reserved its order on the PIL filed by advocate ML Sharma. He had said that the cause of action partially had arisen in Delhi, as various offices and constitutional bodies were there.
