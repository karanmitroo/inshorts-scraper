RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Saturday called for a system for assessing the wider impact of monetary policies of global central banks. He suggested a colour-coded system for grading policies green, orange or red, based on their spillover effect. Rajan added a group of "eminent academics with reasonable representation across the globe" should be formed for such grading and analysis.
