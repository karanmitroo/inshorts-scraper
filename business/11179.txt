Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said that India is expected to see a "strong" GDP growth of 7.4% in the current fiscal and a 7.5% growth in 2017-18. It said the country's private consumption would be boosted by increasing public wages and decreasing inflation. Further, investments will pick up as corporate deleveraging continues and infrastructure projects mature.
