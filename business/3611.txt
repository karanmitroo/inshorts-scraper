Employees of state-owned telecom firm Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) have called a nationwide strike on 27 July for not being given wage hike by the Third Pay Revision Committee. The hike was recommended on the basis of performance of public sector firms. The employee union said that BSNL became a loss-making entity because of anti-BSNL policies by government.
