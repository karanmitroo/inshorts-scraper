A 26-year-old woman is suing GlaxoSmithKline after its drug burned 90% of her skin, nearly blinded her, and forced her into medically-induced coma. The student, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed the medication in 2013, claimed blisters broke out over her body leaving her “in excruciating pain”. She, along with others, is claiming $3.45 million (₹22 crore) in medical costs.
