Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told a Parliamentary Committee that former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan was on board with demonetisation, which was finalised in May 2016. Das reportedly added that discussion on demonetisation between the government and RBI began in January-February. Earlier, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said demonetisation was one of the reasons why Rajan left.
