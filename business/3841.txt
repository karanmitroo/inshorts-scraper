The government has rejected reports suggesting that GST applies to free food served at religious institutions and added that GST is not applicable on such free food. It further clarified that 'prasadam' supplied by temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras won't attract CGST and SGST or IGST. However, inputs required for making 'prasadam', like sugar and ghee, would attract GST.
