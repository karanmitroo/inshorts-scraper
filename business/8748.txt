IT major Infosys has split its four large industry verticals into 15 smaller units amid attempts to make the company agile and improve client focus. The move aims to establish a structure where smaller ‘companies’ run within the parent firm Infosys. Each of these units, with $500-$700 million in revenue, will have a separate head, and profit & loss responsibilities.
