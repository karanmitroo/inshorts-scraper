Private sector lender HDFC Bank on Tuesday reported its lowest-ever quarterly profit growth of 15% at â‚¹3,865 crore for the December quarter. The slow growth was attributed to the government's decision to demonetise high-value currency. Notably, the lender had consistently delivered 30% profit growth for more than 32 quarters without a break till about two years ago.
