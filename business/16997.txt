The media giant - Network18 Media and Investments Ltd - which got acquired in May by Mukesh Ambani’s RIL, Tuesday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 1k crore for the quarter ended Jun-30. “The overall consolidated numbers are lower than our expectations, likely due to the entertainment operations or non-news operations having under-performed,” said an analyst.
