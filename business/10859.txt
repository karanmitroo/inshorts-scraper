The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said its oil revenue has plunged to a ten-year low in 2015 to $518.2 billion, 46% lower than that in 2014. The fall in revenue was attributed to a collapse in oil prices despite OPEC's oil exports rising 1.7% during 2015 and its share in global oil production rising by 0.2% to 43%.
