Ruling BJP legislator from Rajasthan, Bhawani Singh Rajawat has alleged that billionaire industrialists Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani were already aware of PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation decision. "They were given hints of demonetisation after which they converted their money", said Rajawat. However, when his statement was broadcast on a news channel, he denied making any such remark.
