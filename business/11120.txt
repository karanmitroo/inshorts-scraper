German automaker Volkswagen on Saturday said it will recall 1.9 lakh cars in India starting July to fix the emission software. However, the recall is voluntary as the carmaker did not face any charges regarding violating emission norms in India, it added. This marks the beginning of the recall of 3.23 lakh vehicles announced by Volkswagen earlier.
