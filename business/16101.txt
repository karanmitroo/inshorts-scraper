Snapping its five-day rising streak, gold slipped from five-month highs by falling Rs 150 to Rs 28,350 per ten gram  Thursday. Gold prices came down as demand eased at existing levels amidst a weak overseas trend. Tracking gold, silver also dropped by Rs 450 to Rs 39,700 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
