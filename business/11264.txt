Financial ratings agency Fitch on Thursday projected India’s economic growth to accelerate to 8% by 2018-19, from 7.9% in 2017-18 and 7.7% in 2016-17. “Gradual implementation of the structural reform agenda, which continues to broaden, is expected to contribute to higher growth,” Fitch said. In comparison, it estimated global growth to remain at around 3% in 2018.
