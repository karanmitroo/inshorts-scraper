Banks have started issuing new currency notes of ₹500 denomination from Sunday in some parts of the country, following the demonetisation of the older ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. The notes were reportedly issued by banks in Delhi, Bhopal, and Mumbai. Notably, the first consignment of 50 lakh pieces of the new notes was dispatched to the RBI earlier on Sunday.
