BBC has announced cutting over 1,000 jobs as it expects a deficit of $234 million in its licence-fee forecast for the next financial year owing to the much cheaper availability of programmes on the internet. Every UK household pays about $227 a year to the media house as licence-fee. Only 50% of British 16 to 24-year-olds reportedly watch live TV.
