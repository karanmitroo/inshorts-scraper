The US-based IT firm HP Inc has said it will cut 3,000-4,000 jobs over the next three years as it faces continued challenges in the market for personal computers and printers. The cuts are in addition to 3,000 jobs that HP previously said it was trimming this fiscal year. The company has about 50,000 employees worldwide, said a spokesperson.
