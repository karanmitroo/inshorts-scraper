A manager at a retail store in China forced underperforming employees to tear up their 100 yuan (over â‚¹940) notes as punishment for not meeting daily targets of handing out 100 flyers. The manager claimed she wanted to teach her employees not to waste company resources. The manager was fined 1,000 yuan, as deliberate destruction of yuan is an offence.
