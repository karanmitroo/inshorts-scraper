Telecom regulator TRAI has cut the Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC) by 57% to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise, with effect from October 1. It also said the fee will be scrapped from January, 2020. Notably, IUC is payable by a service provider, whose subscriber originates the call, to the service provider in whose network the call terminates.
