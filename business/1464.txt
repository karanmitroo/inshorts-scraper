Nestle India has been slapped with a fine of â‚¹45 lakh after Maggi samples allegedly failed to pass a lab test. The district authorities in Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh had collected the samples in 2015 and tests found ash content above the permissible limits. However, Nestle India said it appeared to be a case of application of incorrect standards.
