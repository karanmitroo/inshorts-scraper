The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday launched a mobile-based payments solution ‘mVisa’. The application will enable users to make payments from their smartphones by scanning a unique QR (Quick Response) code at merchant outlets. In its first phase, the service has been introduced in Bangalore and will be rolled out in other cities gradually.
