Mahindra Chairman Anand Mahindra on Thursday called taxi-service provider Ola and Uber the biggest potential threat to the automotive industry. "Since these apps operators have made transporation a commodity, (auto) sales could be hit", he said. Further, he added, "A lot of youngsters who can own vehicles today don't want to own one, but only need access to transportation."
