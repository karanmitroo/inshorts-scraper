An Uber driver was attacked in San Jose, capital of Costa Rica, by taxi drivers who smashed his car with a baseball bat and threatened him. Meanwhile at least two of Uber's cars were taken out of circulation during the company's first weekend of business after the government said that the service was operating illegally.
