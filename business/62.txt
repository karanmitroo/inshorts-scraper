Fraud-accused Gitanjali Gems owner Mehul Choksi has said he will return to India if his passport cancellation is revoked, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the Prevention of Money Laundering Act court on Thursday. ED counsel Hiten Vengaokar made this submission as he sought to obtain a non-bailable warrant against Choksi. Vengaokar said "reversal of the revocation" isn't required for return.
