Canadian telecom firm BlackBerry has been denied an Indian patent on the company's claimed invention regarding a method of verifying digital signatures, especially in smaller devices like the mobile phone. The patent office denied the company's claim citing a section of the Patent Act 1970 which stated that computer programs or algorithms are categorised as non-patentable subject matter.
