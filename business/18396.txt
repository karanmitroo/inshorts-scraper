The Sensex closed at 17,968.08 on Tuesday, down 590.05 points (3.18%) compared to Monday's close, while the Rupee tumbled further to touch a new historic low of 66.24 against the dollar. The rupee declined amid weak local equities and demand for the dollar from importers and banks. Gold hit an all-time high of Rs.33,000 per ten-grams in the national capital.
