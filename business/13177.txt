Indian stock markets witnessed a sharp decline on Thursday, with the BSE Sensex dropping over 300 points and the NSE Nifty losing over 100 points within the first 30 minutes of trading. The slump in the Indian markets was triggered by negative cues from the Chinese markets, which halted trading for the second time this week after plunging over 7%.
