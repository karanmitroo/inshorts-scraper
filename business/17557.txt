Google Inc's Internet business revenue grew 19% (to $15.42 billion) in the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street targets as the price of its online ads continued to decline. Due to this, shares of the search giant went down 5.7% to $525 on Wednesday. The net income for the three months ended March 31 stands at $3.45 billion.
