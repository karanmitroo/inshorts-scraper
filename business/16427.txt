Former PM Manmohan Singh said that India can achieve a growth rate of 8-9% provided there is a "national consensus" on policies to take advantage of globalisation. India posted a growth rate of below 5% in the last two fiscals--2012-13 and 2013-14. In the current fiscal, the government estimates the growth rate to be between 5.4-5.9%.
