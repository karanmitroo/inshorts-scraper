Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said it is "great" to be back in Chicago. “Taking my bike out and riding the bike path along Lake Shore Drive, that’s one of the great experiences in my life...I hope to do it as long as I can," he stated. Rajan returned to the University of Chicago in September after his term ended.
