Tata Motors is reportedly planning to change the name of its latest hatchback, the 'Zica', as it sounds similar to 'Zika' virus, which the WHO declared a 'global health emergency'. Extensive marketing for the car featuring footballer Lionel Messi had been going on for two weeks. Notably, the car will be showcased at the upcoming Auto Expo in New Delhi.
