The Finance Ministry on Friday said that non-resident Indians (NRIs) can exchange and deposit scrapped ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes at specified RBI offices till June 30. This comes after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared an ordinance criminalising possession of demonetised notes worth over ₹10,000. Under the ordinance, holding, transferring, and receiving old notes is illegal and a punishable offence.
