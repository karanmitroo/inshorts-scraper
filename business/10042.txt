Public sector lender Punjab National Bank has allowed its locker holders to make any number of visits at lockers in a year without paying any additional cost, against 12 free yearly visits permitted earlier. The rule has been put in place since August 1. The "customer-friendly" move makes PNB the first public sector bank to do so, an official said.
