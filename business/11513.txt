The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty on Monday gained 460.36 and 132.60 points to settle at 25,688.86 and 7,866.05 respectively. Market sentiment reportedly remained buoyant amid positive corporate results that raised hopes about domestic economy, and a weaker-than-expected US jobs report on Friday that led economists to anticipate only one interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year.
