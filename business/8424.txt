Tata Sons Interim Chairman Ratan Tata is reportedly looking for a partner who could buy the company's stake held by ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry and his family. The Tatas are said to have approached sovereign wealth funds and a few other long-term investors regarding the same. Mistry's family holds about 18% of Tata Sons stake.
