Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said that passing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill in the Parliament’s next session is “certainly” doable. “I am in continuous touch with [the Congress]... After all, it was a bill brought by them. For political reasons, they have done a volte-face but they should not be doing it indefinitely,” Jaitley added.
