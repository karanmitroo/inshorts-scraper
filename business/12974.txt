After plunging by 617.34 points in intra-day trade on Wednesday to breach the 24,000-mark for the first time since May 2014, the Sensex recovered slightly to end 417.80 points down at 24,062.04. Meanwhile, the Nifty closed 125.80 points down at 7,309.30. Analysts attributed the slump to heavy selling of Asian stock triggered by IMF, which slashed 2016's global growth forecast.
