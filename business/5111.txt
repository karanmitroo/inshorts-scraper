A special Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) court on Friday quashed a non-bailable warrant issued against Sahara chief Subrata Roy when he appeared before the court. The warrant was also revoked on grounds that Roy will appear in all hearings now and the court asked him to submit an undertaking for the same.
