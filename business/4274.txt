Amazon has been granted a temporary restraining order to prevent former Amazon Web Services Vice President Gene Farrell from joining Smartsheet, which Amazon considers a competitor. In a lawsuit, Amazon said that by joining Smartsheet, Farrell would violate the non-compete agreement as he "cannot possibly forget everything he knows" about Amazon's plans while developing products for a competitor.
