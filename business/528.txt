The Australian government on Sunday confirmed it won't provide financing for Adani Enterprises to build a rail line for its proposed Carmichael coal project. Adani had sought a $713 million concessional loan for the rail link connecting the mine to a port. The long-delayed $16.5 billion project faces oppostion from environmentalists, who claim it will harm the Great Barrier Reef.
