The offices of Japan's largest advertising agency Dentsu were raided by the Labour Ministry on Monday over suspicion that several workers had been forced to work long hours in violation of labour laws. The raid comes after the suicide of a female employee in December 2015, which the Ministry had ruled as "death by overwork".
