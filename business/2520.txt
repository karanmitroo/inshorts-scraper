Airbus has launched an internal probe into possible corruption after it was alleged that two firms it secretly controlled engaged in transactions worth €19 million (₹146 crore), which resulted in unexplained payments. The largest aerospace multinational in Europe, Airbus said it was probing "improper practices" to ensure they are not repeated. It is already being probed for corruption in Britain.
