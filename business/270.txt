The central government has cleared a proposal to allow private firms to mine coal for commercial use, ending the monopoly of state-owned Coal India. It is the most ambitious coal sector reform since the nationalisation of this sector in 1973, Union Minister Piyush Goyal said. Till now, the private sector was allowed to mine coal only for their own consumption.
