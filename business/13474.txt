Global airlines body International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Thursday revised its estimate for net profit by airlines in 2015 to $33 billion, from $29.3 billion forecasted in June, due to low fuel prices. IATA further predicted passenger capacity in the Asia-Pacific region to grow at 8.4% in 2016, compared to 6% in 2015.
