In India's costliest apartment deal, a sea-facing duplex in the tony Darshan Apartments on Mount Pleasant Road, Mumbai was sold last month for Rs 57-crore or roughly Rs 1.35-lakh/sq. ft. The flat was sold by relatives of Vikram Sarabhai, the founder of India's space programme, to the Bulchandanis, a prominent business family with interests in software, aluminium and real estate.
