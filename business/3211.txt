US payroll services company ADP's (Automatic Data Processing) CEO Carlos Rodriguez reportedly called investor Bill Ackman, a "spoiled brat" and said he "doesn't know what he's talking about". This came after Ackman reportedly sought 5 seats on ADP's 10-member board after he revealed his new stake of 8%, and asked for repeated extensions to submit nominations for replacements.
