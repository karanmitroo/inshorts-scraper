Billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili has sued Credit Suisse Group in Singapore, New Zealand, and Bermuda. He alleged that the bank must have known about the actions of a former employee who forged trades to cover losses from other customersâ€™ accounts. Credit Suisse earlier said that to the best of its knowledge, the former employee acted alone.
