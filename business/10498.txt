Multilateral funding agency Asian Development Bank on Thursday stated that it has raised around ₹500 crore by issuing five-year offshore Indian rupee-linked bonds. The transaction, with the longest maturity and the largest size of any ADB rupee bond, demonstrates "investor interest" in India, an official said. The proceeds from the bonds are meant to support private sector lending in India.
