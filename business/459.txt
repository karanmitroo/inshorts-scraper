The Finance Ministry has informed the Central Information Commission that it doesn't have information regarding loans given to Vijay Mallya. While hearing the matter of an RTI applicant, Chief Information Commissioner RK Mathur said the Ministry's response was "vague and not sustainable as per law". He directed the ministry to transfer the application to the authority that held the information.
