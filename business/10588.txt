Gold imports declined by about 48% to $3.90 billion in the first quarter of 2016-17 against $7.51 billion in April-June 2015, according to the Commerce Ministry's data. The sliding prices of the metal in both global and domestic markets contributed to the fall, analysts said. The trade deficit narrowed to $8.11 billion against $10.82 billion in June 2015.
