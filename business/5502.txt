The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday exempted banks dealing in government businesses from remaining open on April 1 in view of the annual closing business. This reverses RBI's earlier order where it asked the banks to mandatorily remain open on all days from March 25 to April 1, including Saturday, Sunday and all holidays.
