The rupee on Wednesday slipped 19 paise to Rs 64.16 per US dollar in intra-day trade. The rupee has fallen for the third straight day on fresh demand for the US dollar from banks and importers. Experts have mixed views whether or not the RBI should intervene to arrest rupee's decline as it has fallen 10% during last one year.
