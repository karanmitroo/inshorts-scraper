The Railways Ministry is rethinking the current flexi-fare system and is considering introducing a dynamic pricing system for train tickets, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has said. Under dynamic pricing system, fares will be decided as per the season and demand. Fares will be automatically adjusted via artificial intelligence, algorithms or technology, to help trains have more occupancy, he added.
