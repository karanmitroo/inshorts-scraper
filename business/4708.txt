Fox News has revealed that its former Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes died on Thursday at the age of 77. He joined the network in 1996 and helped create it with billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Ailes resigned last year following allegations of sexual harassment, marking an end to his 20-year reign at the most-watched cable channel in the US.
