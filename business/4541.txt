The government is considering to privatise Air India, which has a debt of over â‚¹50,000 crore and is surviving on a taxpayer bailout. The government wants to sell the money-losing carrier as its market share has shrunk to 12.9% from 35% a decade ago. Moreover, it has been facing aggressive competition from rivals and has been unprofitable for a decade.
