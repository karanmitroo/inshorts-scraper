Bharti Airtel is reportedly set to make its 2G and 3G mobile internet packs sold online costlier for its pre-paid customers across the country. The company is withdrawing discounts that it was offering online to bring the prices at par with the plans sold by retailers offline. It has also raised prices of 10 of its data packs.
