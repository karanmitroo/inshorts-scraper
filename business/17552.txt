According to Bloomberg's Matthew Klein, Yahoo's core business, search and advertising, is worth negative-$10 billion. The math: Yahoo's total market cap is $37-billion. Its 24% stake in Alibaba is worth $37-billion, and 35% stake in Yahoo Japan is worth $10-billion. The paradox is explained as "conglomerate discount", a business can be worth less than zero, but a company can't be.
