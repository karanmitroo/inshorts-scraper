RBI wants India's public sector banks to opt for private sector candidates for the top jobs. However, this can be a challenge when the salary is 10-25 times lower than what private-sector bank bosses earn, e.g., the total remuneration for the CEO and MD of ICICI Bank in 2012-13 was around Rs.5 crore, while itâ€™s Rs.23 lakh for SBI's chairman.
