US confectionery conglomerate Mars Inc has recalled chocolate bars and other products including Mars, Snickers and Milky Way bars, over risks of choking, after a piece of plastic was found in a Snickers bar in Germany. All of the recalled products were manufactured at a factory at Veghel, Netherlands and mostly covered countries in Europe, media reports said.
