General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR) will override bilateral tax treaties like Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said on Wednesday. GAAR was introduced in the 2012-13 budget but will come into force from April 1, 2017. Earlier on Tuesday, India signed a pact with Mauritius to amend the DTAA to tax capital gains from alienation of assets.
