Shares of US-based cable company Time Warner rose as much as 8% on Friday to touch their highest level in nearly 15 years. This followed reports of an acquisition by telecom major AT&T worth about $85 billion. The purchase of Time Warner, which owns HBO and Cartoon Network, among others, by AT&T could be the world's biggest deal this year.
