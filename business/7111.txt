Citing health reasons, employees of West Bengal's Salboni currency printing press have stopped working overtime, which is likely to reduce daily printing of currency notes by 60 lakh. The staff had been working 12-hour shifts instead of the regular 9-hour ones for the past fortnight to put more money into circulation. It had been printing 4.6 crore notes per day.
