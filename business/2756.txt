Over 2 lakh directors on boards of companies will be barred from holding any board position in new ventures, according to reports. This comes after names of 2.1 lakh companies were struck off by the government for not filing returns and not completing other formalities. They will, however, be allowed to hold on to their current board positions, reports added.
