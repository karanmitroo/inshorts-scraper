World's second-biggest economy China could face a possible debt crisis in the next three years amid excessive credit growth in the banking sector, international watchdog Bank for International Settlements said. It added that China's credit-to-GDP gap has hit a record high of 30.1% in 2016's first quarter. Last year, China's total debt hit $25 trillion, about 249% of its GDP.
