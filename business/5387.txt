Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan has said, “The present Infosys’ Board has let down its founders and lost credibility to continue." "Its members should be replaced with new people,” he added. Further, backing Co-founder Narayana Murthy's opposition to pay hike of COO UB Pravin Rao, Balakrishnan said the present Board had lost moral courage by favouring executives and ignoring employees.
