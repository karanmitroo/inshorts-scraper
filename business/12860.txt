US-based 110-year-old firm Xerox on Friday announced its plans to split into two independent companiesâ€“ hardware business and services business. As part of the move, activist investor Carl Icahn will be given several seats on the company's board. The company made this announcement alongside its December quarter results, that saw a fourth-straight year of declining profits and sales.
