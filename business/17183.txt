In an unprecedented step, the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday decided to shut stock markets as the Sensex stopped updating just 15 minutes into continuous trade, due to a network outage. "Network service vendor HCL team is working to resolve the market. Once the network issue is resolved, the markets will restart," a BSE spokesperson said.
