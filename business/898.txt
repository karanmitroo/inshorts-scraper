The Delhi High Court on Thursday declined Reckitt Benckiser's plea to pass an interim order restraining Patanjali from airing its toilet cleaner advertisements. The UK-based company alleged that Patanjali copied the shape, pattern, and labelling of its Harpic bottle as well as "mocking" it in the advertisement. The court has asked Patanjali to respond to the allegations within 10 days.
