Tata Motors Chairman N Chandrasekaran has said turning around the company's domestic business is "the need of the hour". This came after the company's market share in commercial vehicles segment fell to 44.4% in 2016-17 from a high of 59.4% 2011-12. Delays in new product launches and lack of adequate response to competition have contributed to this performance, said Chandrasekaran.
