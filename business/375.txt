India's second-largest public lender Punjab National Bank has said it has detected fraudulent transactions worth $1.77 billion (over â‚¹11,360 crore) at a Mumbai branch. The bank said the transactions were "for the benefit of a few select account holders with their apparent connivance". Without naming those involved, PNB said other banks appeared to have advanced money to these customers abroad.
