European steel giant ArcelorMittal has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that its coke plant in the US emitted large amounts of pollution. PennEnvironment, which sued ArcelorMittal, also alleged that a key pollution control device wasn't functioning. The advocacy group said this is likely the largest citizen suit penalty of its kind in Pennsylvania's history.
