US tech giant Apple on Wednesday was slapped a fine of 20 million Taiwanese dollar (USD 667,000) for violating a fair trade law over local iPhone pricing in Taiwan. According to Fair Trade Commission, Apple had interfered in the pricing and mobile phone payment rates of three local telecom service providers, despite selling them the distribution rights to the phones.
