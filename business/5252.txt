India's retail inflation rose to a five-month high of 3.81% in the month of March, compared with Februaryâ€™s 3.65%, government data released on Wednesday stated. The rise was due to costlier protein items, edible oils, and non-food products like fuel and light. Further, food inflation was at 1.85% as against 2.01% in February.
