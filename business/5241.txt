Infosys on Thursday named Ravi Venkatesan, former chairman of Microsoft India, as Co-chairman of its board, where he was already an independent director. The appointment comes after a public disagreement with Co-founder Narayana Murthy, who had raised concerns about the company's governance, and pay hikes of top executives. Notably, Venkatesan has been on the Infosys board since 2011.
