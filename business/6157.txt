The Chairman and Managing Director of Nestlé India Suresh Narayanan has admitted that managing the Maggi noodles crisis was the toughest assignment of his career. Further, he said that the "Nestlé we are building is for another 100 years". Notably, Maggi had been banned after it was declared "unsafe" for consumption due to presence of lead content beyond permissible limits.
