The US WTI crude on Wednesday climbed to $49.02 and Brent crude jumped to $49.21 a barrel after the crude inventories fell more than US Energy Information Administration's expectations. The recent rise in crude prices is also attributed to Canadian wildfires, a near economic meltdown in Venezuela and a spate of violent attacks against the Libyan and Nigerian energy industries.
