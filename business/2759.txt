Tata Motors on Monday said its President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Timothy Leverton has resigned. Leverton has decided to disengage from his services in the organisation as he wishes to relocate back to the UK for personal reasons, Tata Motors said. Leverton has been associated with Tata Motors since 2010, working out of the company's Pune-based engineering research centre.
