UK-based British American Tobacco (BAT) has offered to buy US tobacco firm Reynolds American in a $47 billion deal, which would create the worldâ€™s largest listed tobacco company. The deal will bring together brands such as BAT's Lucky Strike and Reynolds' Camel. Notably, the acquisition would be the biggest by a UK firm since the 'Brexit' vote.
