Continuing its free fall, the rupee on Monday breached 63-mark a dollar to end at record low of 63.13, recording the decade's worst single-day fall of 148 paise, heightening fears that more capital control steps could be in the offing. Weighed down by heavy dollar demand and fall in stocks markets, the rupee fell to historic intra-day low of 63.30.
