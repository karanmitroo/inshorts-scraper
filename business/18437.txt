New York-based Omnicom Group and Paris-based Publicis Groupe SA, the second- and third-biggest ad companies respectively by revenue, are combining in a "merger of equals" to create the world's largest advertising firm worth over $30-billion, overtaking current market leader WPP PLC. The move is made to encourage their focus on growing Asian and Latin American markets like China and Brazil.
