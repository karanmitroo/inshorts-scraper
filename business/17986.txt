The second edition of Gogle's Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF), held from 10th-14th December, witnessed overwhelming response from shoppers. The website, gosf.in, saw over 2 million unique visitors, twice of what it got last year. Though, apparels and electronics saw the biggest jump, offbeat categories such as cars and housing also reported great traction.
