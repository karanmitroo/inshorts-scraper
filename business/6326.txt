The I-T department on Monday clarified that no questions will be asked about cash deposits of up to ₹2.5 lakh made after the demonetisation decision. Only those accounts will be probed that do not match the tax returns, it stated. "We will ensure there is no harassment to genuine person,” Central Board of Direct Taxes Chairman Sushil Chandra said.
