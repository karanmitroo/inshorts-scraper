SpiceJet Friday submitted a revival plan to the government with a proposed investment of $200 million from founding promoter Ajay Singh and US-based JP Morgan Chase. "It was a constructive meeting," the airline's COO Sanjiv Kapoor said. He maintained there was "no outstanding" as of now with any oil marketing company, adding that SpiceJet was currently flying 230 flights a day.
