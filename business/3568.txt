The Opposition in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday asked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to clarify whether the government has decided to scrap the new ₹2,000 note and introduce a ₹1,000 coin. However, Jaitley did not respond even as Opposition members insisted for clarification from him on the issue. This comes after reports said RBI stopped printing ₹2,000 notes 5 months ago.
