The Security Printing and Minting Corp of India has printed only 1.5 crore pieces of new ₹500 note against a target of 40 crore pieces by November, as per reports. This has led to the government 'struggling' to meet replacement demand. Further, nearly 150 crore pieces of ₹2,000 notes have been printed, against an order of 350 crore pieces.
