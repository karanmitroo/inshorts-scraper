American stock markets plummeted on Monday amid a global selloff frenzy triggered by the Chinese economy. The Dow Jones index slipped over 1000 points before entering a correction, with both the DJIA and S&P 500 losing nearly 3% at 11.30 am EDT. The NYSE announced that it will suspend trading for 15 minutes if the S&P plunges over 7 percent.
