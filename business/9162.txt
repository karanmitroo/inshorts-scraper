The Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD), an office under the Commerce Ministry, has recommended against the imposition of anti-dumping duty on batteries imported from China and Vietnam. The imports have not caused any "material injury" to the domestic industry, the DGAD said. Anti-dumping duties are imposed to check the surge in below-cost imports and ensure fair trade.
