A US court on Tuesday ruled that Dell CEO Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners underpriced the computer maker's $24.9 billion buyout in 2013 by 22%. Pronouncing the ruling, which applies to 5.5 million shares, the court said the fair share price was $17.62, not the $13.75 deal price. With interest, investors who sought appraisal will get $20.84 per share.
