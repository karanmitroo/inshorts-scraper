Warning that the global economy may be slipping into problems similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has asked central banks from across the world to define 'new rules of the game'. "I think it's a problem for the world. It's not just a problem for the industrial countries or emerging markets", Rajan said.
