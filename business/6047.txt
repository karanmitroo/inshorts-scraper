Israeli drinks company SodaStream has recalled more than 58,000 soda bottles across the US and Canada over the fear that they could potentially explode under pressure. Affected bottles were sold at stores including Target, Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond and online through Amazon. The company has asked customers to immediately stop using the bottles and is offering a full refund.
