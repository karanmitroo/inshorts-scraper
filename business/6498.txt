KC Neogy and HN Bahuguna have been the only two Finance Ministers who did not present India's Union Budget. This was because they held office for such short durations in between two budget days that they had no occasion to present a budget. Notably, Neogy, who was India's second Finance Minister, held the office for just 35 days.
