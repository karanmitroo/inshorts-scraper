Reliance Communications Chairman Anil Ambani on Tuesday said the company has accomplished a "virtual merger" with his brother Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio to share spectrum services needed to offer better telecom services. Reportedly, the brothers have started collaborating recently, following a period of competition after the split of Reliance, founded by their late father Dhirubhai Ambani.
