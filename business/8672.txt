Oil prices surged over 2% on Wednesday, with US crude prices reaching their highest in 15 months after the government reported an unexpected fall in inventories. This also followed Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister stating that many nations are willing to join OPEC's production cuts. Notably, an OPEC meet later this month will discuss the first output cut in eight years.
