A Muslim man has sued Virgin Atlantic airlines after he was ordered off a flight for "innocently" mentioning the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Mohammad Khan alleged that airline staff "racially and religiously profiled" him over a "harmless" conversation with a flight stewardess. Khan was denied a refund on his $720 ticket, and had to spend $1,060 on another flight.
