Infosys has cut around 500 jobs at its Hyderabad and Bengaluru campuses over 'non-performance', Indian Express reported. The 500 people included manager-level staff as well, but comprised mostly junior level employees who were not put on any project, reports said. Notably, this comes after Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) terminated its project which had around 3,000 Infosys employees assigned.
