Industry body Process Plant and Machinery Association of India (PPMAI) has sought PM Modi's intervention to withdraw the proposed Quality Control Order on steel that will enforce mandatory adherence of steel manufacturers to the BIS standards. The current steel industry is well organised as per the international standards and enforcing BIS standards would lead to loss of business, PPMAI said.
