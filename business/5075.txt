McCain Foods USA on Friday announced a partial recall of two varieties of hash browns over fears they may contain pieces of golf balls. McCain Foods said "extraneous golf ball materials" may have been "inadvertently harvested with potatoes" despite its "stringent supply standards". It said the pieces could be a choking hazard but injuries have not been reported yet.
