US chocolate-making firm Hershey's board of directors on Thursday unanimously rejected a $23 billion takeover bid by confectionery conglomerate Mondelez. Reports claimed that the deal would have created the worldâ€™s largest candy maker with an 18% market share, overtaking Mars' 13%.  While rejecting the bid, Hershey's board said, "it provided no basis for further discussion" with Mondelez.
