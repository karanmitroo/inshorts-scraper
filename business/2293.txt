US technology giant IBM has announced that it has more employees in India than in the US, according to a New York Times report. The company employs about 1,30,000 people in India and that constitutes about one-third of its total workforce. "IBM India, in the truest sense, is a microcosm of the IBM company," IBM India Chairman Vanitha Narayanan said.
