World's largest miner by market capitalisation BHP Billiton on Tuesday posted a record $6.4 billion loss for the year to June, on account of write-downs, a dam disaster in Brazil, and a commodities slump. The Anglo-Australian miner's underlying attributable profit slumped 81% to $1.2 billion. The company is confident in its commodities' long-term outlook, Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said.
