China has removed about 1,400 baby formula products from stores as part of a safety overhaul. Factories making these products now need to register products with China's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and pass safety inspections. Out of the nearly 2,300 baby formulations available to customers before January 1, China's FDA has approved 940 infant-formula products so far this year.
