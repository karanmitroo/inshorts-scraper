United Nations' report 'Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2015' showed that India's economic growth is likely to reach 8.1% in the current financial year and 8.2% in 2016.  The figures are in agreement with estimates of the Finance Ministry. The growth is being attributed to strong consumer spending amid low inflation, infrastructure projects and governmentâ€™s reform measures.
