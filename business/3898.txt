Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said that Centre did not play a big brother role in fixing GST rates. "It has been collectively agreed by the GST Council, a body representing 29 states and seven Union Territories and a lone member (the Centre)," she stated. GST rates were fixed by following the revenue-neutral philosophy, she added.
