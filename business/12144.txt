The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty recorded gains for the fourth consecutive week, rising around 1.5% in the holiday-shortened week ended March 23. Analysts attributed the gains to buying by foreign institutional investors and hopes of a rate cut by the RBI in April. While Sensex gained 384.82 points to close at 25,337.56, Nifty rose by 112.15 points to 7,716.50.
