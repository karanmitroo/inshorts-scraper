According to reports, oil output from the Americas reduced by 1.5 million barrels per day over the last quarter and producers from Asia and Australia cut production by around 2,50,000 barrels per day. Some of the production cuts in the Americas were reportedly attributed to wildfires in Canada, the political situation in Venezuela, and stalling U.S. frackers among others.
