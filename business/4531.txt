Privatising state-owned airline Air India will be "very difficult" unless the government writes off at least part of its â‚¹52,000 crore debt, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya said. It would be difficult even if the sale is open to both domestic and foreign buyers, he added. Niti Aayog recently submitted a report recommending a stake sale in the airline.
