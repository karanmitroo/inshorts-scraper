Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday tweeted saying that Moody's upgradation of India's sovereign rating was in contrast with the "mood of the people". He further tweeted, "Moody talks about sunshine tomorrow. We are worried about the dark clouds today." This comes after credit rating agency Moody's upgraded India's sovereign rating to Baa2 from its lowest investment grade (Baa3).
