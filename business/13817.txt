Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reportedly drafted a project called ‘Leap 4.5’ under which it aims to cut costs by £4.5 billion ($6.8 billion) and annually manufacture 1 million cars by the end of the decade. The move comes following slowdown of JLR’s sales in China (one of its biggest markets) and increasing costs of satisfying emissions standards.
