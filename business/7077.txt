Dai Jia-peng, General Manager of Foxconn's automation committee, said the company aims to fully automate its factories. Foxconn, which manufactures Apple's iPhones in China, is automating its factories in phases. In the first phase, work that is considered dangerous will be automated and in the final phase, only a minimum number of workers will be employed for logistics and inspection.
