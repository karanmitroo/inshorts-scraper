After mobile operator T-Mobile premiered a BDSM-themed commercial slamming rival Verizon, the latter responded by saying, "We're into BDSM. Bigger coverage map, Devastating Speed, and Massive capacity." The T-mobile ad hit out at Verizon for "punishing" users on going over data limits. Later, T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeted about Verizon being jealous of the company.
