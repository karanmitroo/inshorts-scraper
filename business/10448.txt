The total number of telephone users declined from 1,059.29 million in April to 1,058.03 million in May this year, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). This 0.12% monthly fall in growth rate is due to lower subscriptions in urban areas, which had 604.98 million subscriptions in May compared to the 607.21 million in April.
