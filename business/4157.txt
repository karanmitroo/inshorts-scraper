UK's largest government-owned lender Royal Bank of Scotland has said it is cutting 443 jobs in the country, which help handle loans for small businesses. The lender plans to shift many of the roles to India as part of an ongoing cost cutting drive. "RBS will be getting that work done more cheaply", the bank said on moving the jobs.
