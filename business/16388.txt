The labour unions of Coal India Ltd have threatened to go on a five-day strike from January 6 to protest government's plans to sell off a stake in the state-run corporation. The call for strike triggers concerns about supplies from Coal India. The government wants to sell the Coal India stake to meet its $9.5 billion annual divestment target.
