Indiaâ€™s onion exports dropped to 4.86 lakh tonnes in the first half of the ongoing fiscal, 18% less than the year-ago period. Exports fell after the government increased the minimum export price (MEP) to $700 per tonne in August, to regulate sky-rocketing prices triggered by unseasonal rains. MEP restrictions were removed on Thursday as prices have been brought under control.
