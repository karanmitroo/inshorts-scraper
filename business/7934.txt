Staging a protest in Chennai against the government's decision to demonetise old high-valued currency, the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Thursday alleged that the Centre is favouring liquor baron Vijay Mallya. Tamil Nadu CPI leader Mutharasan questioned as to how Mallya's â‚¹1,200 crore could be written off so easily and raised allegations that the Centre is against the people.
