Banking major Credit Suisse took out ads in the UK newspapers stressing a zero-tolerance policy on tax evasion, following raids on three of its offices. The ads stated they were a "response to recent reports about tax probes in various European countries". Notably, Credit Suisse was pulled into an international tax evasion and money laundering investigation last week.
