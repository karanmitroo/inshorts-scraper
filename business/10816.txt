The worldâ€™s largest furniture retailer Ikea will recall around 36 million chests and dressers in the United States and Canada, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday. The company was linked to the deaths of six children due to toppling over of unanchored furniture. As part of the recall, Ikea is offering refunds or free wall-anchoring kits.
