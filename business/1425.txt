Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has said it will close 259 more branches across Britain to encourage customers to use online and mobile banking services. The company said the move would result in about 680 job cuts. RBS said it will use the savings to invest in its smartphone offering, which has seen mobile transactions rise over 70% since 2014.
