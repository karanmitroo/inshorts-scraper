SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya on Saturday said the process of recovery of dues from Vijay Mallya-promoted Kingfisher Airlines is going on, "but there are legal challenges." SBI leads a 17-member consortium of lenders that is trying to recover dues running into over Rs 7,500 crore in principal alone from Kingfisher Airlines, which has been grounded since October 2012.
