Germany-based airline Lufthansa said starting a domestic airline in India will be a "misadventure" because of high taxes and operation costs. "You only go make business when you have business plans which give you hope that you can be very successful," an official said. "I did not hear...of any domestic airline in India making a lot of profit,” he added.
