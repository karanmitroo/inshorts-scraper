Switzerland-based UBS retained its position as the world’s biggest private bank in 2015, a study by wealth management researcher Scorpio Partnership has stated. UBS had $1,737.5 billion managed assets by the end of 2015​, nearly $300 billion more than the second-placed Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
