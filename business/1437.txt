The price of Bitcoin on Thursday fell over $1,000 in about 10 minutes to drop below the $10,000-mark. Bitcoin plunged as much as 20% just hours after the cryptocurrency set an all-time high of above $11,000, as sell orders began piling up. The heaviest selling came amid reports of service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges.
