Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has asked telecom regulator TRAI to "impose highest penalty" on Airtel, accusing the latter of "grossly exaggerating" the value of data in a promotional offer, and giving misleading tariff ads. Referring to Airtel's "free data for 12 months worth â‚¹9,000" offer, Jio said the services being offered are in "gross violation" of telecommunication laws.
