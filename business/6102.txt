Infosys' then CFO Rajiv Bansal walked out of a 2015 meeting where board members of the company were asked to approve a proposal to buy Israeli automation technology firm Panaya, reports said. Bansal excused himself from the vote, stood up, and walked out, reports added. Bansal reportedly believed the acquisition was ill-thought-out and would not offer much value to Infosys.
