An RTI activist has accused yoga guru Baba Ramdev of commercialising martyrs Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev in a recent advertisement of Patanjali products. Citing print media advertisements, the activist said using the martyrs' photos was an act of commercialisation of the supreme sacrifices made by them. The activist's legal notice also claimed the advertisement was insulting to the martyrs.
