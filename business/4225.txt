Nepal's Department of Drug Administration on Wednesday ordered Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved to recall six of its medical products as they were found to be of "substandard quality". Correspondence from Patanjali in this regard is still awaited. Notably, a reply to recent RTI in India revealed that nearly 40% of Ayurveda products, including items from Patanjali, were of substandard quality.
