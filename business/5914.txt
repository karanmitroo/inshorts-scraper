A US safety agency wants to fine Nissan Motor over $21,000 (over ₹14 lakh), saying a company plant should have better trained a worker who lost three fingers. The agency said the worker didn’t know how to disable a conveyor line before working on it. It also demanded that Nissan install buzzers to warn workers before a conveyor line started.
