State-owned IDBI Bank on Wednesday launched India's first-of-its-kind facility which will allow retail customers of the bank to invest in government bonds (G-Sec) through the bank's ATMs. Customers need to do a one-time registration to avail the facility. This is in line with "RBI's efforts towards broad-basing and expanding retail holding of government securities in the country", IDBI said.
