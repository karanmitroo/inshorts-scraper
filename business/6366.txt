Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy on Thursday said Indian software companies should stop using H-1B visas to send Indians to other countries. They must recruit Americans in the US, Canadians in Canada, and British people in Britain, Murthy stated. The Indian mindset is to take the "soft option" and becoming multi-cultural is a "very, very hard option", he added.
