Supermarket giant Tesco has reduced the price of women’s standard razors to match that of men’s. Earlier, for a pack of women’s razors, Tesco was charging twice the price of the men’s equivalent. This comes after investigations revealed women were paying around 37% more for gender-targeted items, with razors charging a premium just for having a different colour.
