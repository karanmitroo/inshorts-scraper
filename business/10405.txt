The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority has allowed financial agents to collect service charges between ₹5 and ₹5,000 from subscribers joining the National Pension Scheme via online platform. This aims to encourage Points of Presence (POPs) to "promote and distribute" NPS. The charges will apply to POPs linked subscribers and those subscribed through PAN and bank KYC verification.
