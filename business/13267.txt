International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde on Wednesday said that global economic growth “will be disappointing and uneven in 2016”. She named ageing populations, low productivity, prospects of further rate hikes in the US and the Chinese slowdown among factors contributing to economic uncertainty and vulnerability. Emerging markets face increasing financial risks, she added.
