Paytm Founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma on Monday again took to Twitter to question the acts of a personal banker from HDFC Bank. Sharma shared a user's tweet who claimed the banker told her that Paytm is not safe for payment. Earlier in May, Sharma alleged that an HDFC Bank representative deleted Paytm's app from a user's phone.
