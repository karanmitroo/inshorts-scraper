Rediffusion Y&R Chairman Arun Nanda has accused ousted Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry of leaking selective facts to the media regarding his firm’s engagement with the group. “Please do not place selective facts about us to suit your narrative before the media and public,” Nanda said. This came in response to Mistry’s office detailing a public relations contract with Nanda’s firm.
