Traders' body the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has termed private sector lenders' charge on cash transactions as "financial terrorism". CAIT General Secretary Praveen Khandelwal said this was no way to encourage digital payments. Notably, some banks like HDFC Bank are charging a minimum of â‚¹150 per transaction for cash deposits and withdrawals beyond four free transactions monthly.
