UK's competition regulator has provisionally blocked the $16.3-billion takeover of UK media conglomerate Sky by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. It said the deal would give Murdoch's family, which owns Fox, "too much control" over UK's news providers. Due to the family's control of media company News Corp, it already has significant influence over public opinion, it added.
