Capital markets regulator Sebi on Thursday said that stock exchanges and depositories will be classified as infrastructure companies. This comes after Sebi approved new norms for the listing of stock exchanges, which includes measures like maintaining 51% of shareholding under the public category and ensuring that the holding of trading members, associates or agents does not exceed 49%.
