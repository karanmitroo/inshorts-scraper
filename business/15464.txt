Finland's Nokia released its quarterly revenue report with profits much below market forecasts, plunging its shares by 12%. The profits fell from the anticipated €226 million to €85 million reportedly due to lower sales, high R&D costs and competition in the Chinese market. Nokia expects to ease this drop as it buys the French rival Alcatel-Lucent.
