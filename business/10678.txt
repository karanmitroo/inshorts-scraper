The Telecom Ministry has reportedly cleared the â‚¹3,500-crore 4G spectrum trading deal between Bharti Airtel and Aircel on July 4. As part of the deal, Airtel acquired rights from Aircel in eight telecom circles including Bihar and Assam. Airtel had surrendered 1.2 Mhz spectrum in Odisha before the clearance, as it exceeded the spectrum ownership cap, the report added.
