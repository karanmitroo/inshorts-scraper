India had a trade deficit with as many as 27 countries including China, Iraq, Australia and Iran, during the last three years, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said. India generally runs a deficit with countries from which high-demand commodities like crude oil and gold are sourced, she added. In 2015-16, India's trade deficit fell 14% year-on-year to $118.35 billion.
