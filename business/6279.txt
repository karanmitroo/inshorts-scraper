Japan's SoftBank has reported a loss of over ₹2,300 crore (¥39.3 billion) mainly from its two biggest investments in India, Ola and Snapdeal. The loss, posted for the nine-month period ended December 2016, was due to a decline in the valuations of these startups. SoftBank had written down about ₹3,700 crore in Ola and Snapdeal in November 2016.
