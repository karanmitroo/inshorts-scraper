The G-20 nations on Saturday agreed to improve international trade governance, seeking to remain committed to an "open global economy" and work towards "trade liberalisation and facilitation". This follows a global slowdown due to rising anti-trade measures becoming more universal, experts said. WTO data shows a below 3% global trade growth since 2009 as against an average 7% between 1990-2008.
