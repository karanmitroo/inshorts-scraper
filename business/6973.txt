Some farmers from Madhya Pradesh's Sheopur district on Tuesday received new â‚¹2,000 notes without Mahatma Gandhi's image from a local State Bank of India branch. While the farmers suspected the notes to be fake, bank officials assured that the notes are genuine. "Somehow the notes have not been printed completely. We have taken the notes back," said the branch manager.
