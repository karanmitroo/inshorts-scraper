Economist and former Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog Arvind Panagariya said the economy could reach a growth rate of 6.5% or higher in the current financial year. He pointed out that a recently released Goldman Sachs report makes a plausible case that India will accelerate to 8% growth in 2018-19. Notably, India's GDP growth rate was 7.1% in 2016-17.
