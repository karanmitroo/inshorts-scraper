US-based Caesars Entertainment must face lawsuits from bondholders seeking around $11 billion in claims, a US judge stated on Friday. The judge refused a third court shield from lawsuits that the casino company sought for its parent company. Last year, Caesar's bankrupt operating unit stated that a halt on lawsuits would protect the parent from going into bankruptcy.
