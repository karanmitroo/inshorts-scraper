Delhi government has told Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements from tobacco shops in the city, warning them of legal action if they don't comply. This comes after reports suggested Philip Morris was promoting Marlboro cigarettes by advertising them at tobacco shops and distributing free smokes to young people. Government said such tactics flout the law.
