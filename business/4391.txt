Wilful defaulter Vijay Mallya, who is facing an extradition hearing at London’s Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday, said, "I've nothing to say, I deny all allegations." Stating that he has not done anything illegal and not eluded any court, Mallya said he has enough evidence to prove his case. Mallya fled India last year owing over ₹9,000 crore to banks.
