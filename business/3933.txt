PM Narendra Modi on Saturday sought British counterpart Theresa May’s help to ensure UK’s cooperation in bringing back economic offenders including liquor baron Vijay Mallya. Mallya has been in the UK for months, escaping arrest warrants against him, while a court in London is also hearing a case regarding his return to India. He owes over ₹9,000 crore to banks.
