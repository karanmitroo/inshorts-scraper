Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Thursday announced that the government will unveil ₹1,000 notes with a new colour combination and design in a few months. This comes after the government banned the use of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, and unveiled new ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes. The government gave citizens time until December 30 to exchange their old notes.
