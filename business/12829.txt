Air carrier SpiceJet on Monday launched a feature 'Fly for Sure' that would guarantee air travel within 24 hours for passengers whose flight has been cancelled or delayed by over 90 minutes. The alternate flight will reportedly be booked in the same route as was booked earlier. Passengers can avail the feature by paying a fee of â‚¹299 while booking.
