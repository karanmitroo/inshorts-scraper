Iraq has agreed to swap up to 60,000 barrels of crude oil per day produced from Kirkuk oilfield for Iranian oil. The deal allows Iraq to resume sales of Kirkuk crude, which have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of fields from Kurds in October. The two countries are planning to build a pipeline to carry Kirkuk oil.
