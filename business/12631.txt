India's consumer price inflation edged up to a 17-month high of 5.69% year-on-year in January, up from 5.61% in December, driven up by higher food costs, government data released on Friday suggested. With this, the index witnessed a rise for the sixth-straight month. Retail food prices last month were up 6.85% year-on-year, compared with a 6.40% recorded in December.
