The Road Transport and Highways Ministry is going to make it mandatory to put an over-speeding warning system with beeps or continuous alarms and airbags in all cars, an official has said. Further, the government will also install cameras on roads to check errant drivers and curb accidents. Notably, India accounts for around five lakh road accidents annually.
