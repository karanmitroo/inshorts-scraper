The UK’s largest retail bookmaker William Hill and Canada-based Amaya, which operates PokerStars, the world’s largest online poker business, said they are in discussions for a $5.7 billion merger to create one of the world’s largest gambling firms. This merger would be a reverse takeover, with the smaller group William Hill taking over the larger firm, Amaya.
