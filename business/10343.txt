Electric vehicles maker Tesla has disclosed that it needs $1.1 billion in cash for the third quarter to meet its requirements in payments and planned expenditures. The amount is about a third of the company's cash in hand mid-year. Earlier in March, Tesla said the cost of building and operating its Gigafactory in Nevada, US could exceed the company's expectations.
