South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has said that cryptocurrencies could lead teenagers to get involved in pyramid schemes and drug crimes. He said that students were jumping into the "raging" market to make money, leading some to get embroiled in fraudulent crime. "If we let things continue, I feel some serious pathological phenomenons could occur," he added.
