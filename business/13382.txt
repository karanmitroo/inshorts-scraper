The BSE Sensex on Tuesday lost 284.56 points to close at 25,519.22 while the NSE Nifty fell by 82.40 points to settle at 7,761.95. Analysts attributed the governmentâ€™s revision of its GDP growth rate projection for the ongoing fiscal from 8.1-8.5% to 7-7.5% as a key factor besides weak global cues in triggering negative sentiment.
