For the first time since 2002, Canadian firm Blackberry has called off its annual conference BlackBerry Live Conference. The company reportedly cancelled the event so that it can focus on running a number of smaller, more targeted events. The struggling smartphone maker has also cancelled plans of two new phones prior to their launch.
