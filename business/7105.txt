As part of the Centre's Digital India initiative, Lakshadweep will soon become a 100% cashless society, the Union Territory's Administrator Farooq Khan has said. "Very soon all the shops in the islands would have digital money transaction facilities," he added. Demonetisation had caused no difficulties to the islands and had not triggered any panic among the locals, Khan said.
