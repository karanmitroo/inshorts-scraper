India's annual consumer price inflation for the month of July hit a 23-month high of 6.07%, according to government data released on Friday. This marked the fourth consecutive month that the figure exceeded the target of 5% inflation the RBI expects to reach by March next year. A high inflation of 8.35% in food prices contributed to the price rise.
