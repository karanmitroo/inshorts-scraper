Country's largest carbon black manufacturer Philips Carbon Black Limited has recently come up with a 'penalty clause' in its offer letter, which holds the candidates legally accountable to pay 5% of offered salary(CTC) to the company, if they accept the offer and refuse to join. "It takes us back by months if a probable employee backtracks," the HR director said.
