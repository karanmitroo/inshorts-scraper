Continuing its losing streak for the second straight day, gold prices on Tuesday fell by Rs 170 to trade at a fresh 10-month low of Rs 28,100 per ten gram in the national capital. Traders said sentiments continued to remain bearish on persistent selling by stockists after the RBI last week eased import norms on the yellow metal.
