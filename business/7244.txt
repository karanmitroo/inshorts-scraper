Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro on Saturday suspended the elimination of the country's largest denomination bill, after it led to cash shortages and nationwide unrest. The measure would be postponed until early January, he stated. The move came after Venezuela's decision to demonetise the 100-bolivar note led to vast lines at banks, looting at shops, and anti-government protests.
