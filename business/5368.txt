E-commerce major eBay's Founder Pierre Omidyar's charity firm announced a $100 million commitment to support investigative reporting on Wednesday. The first $4.5 million will go to International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which led the Panama Papers investigation. "A free media is key to providing trusted information and critical checks on those in positions of power," said Omidyar.
