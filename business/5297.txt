Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan has clarified citizens need not pay income tax and Saudi companies' profits won't be taxed under new economic reforms. A value-added tax planned for 2018 would "not be raised above 5% before 2020", he added. This comes amid concerns that all citizens, who currently don't pay income tax, would be taxed under the reforms.
