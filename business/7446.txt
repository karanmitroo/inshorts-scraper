SoftBank Founder Masayoshi Son on Tuesday pledged to invest $50 billion in the US and create 50,000 jobs in startups and new companies. US President-elect Donald Trump claimed that Son said he "would never do this" if Trump had not won the presidential election. The investments will be made through American telecom Sprint, of which 82% is owned by SoftBank.
