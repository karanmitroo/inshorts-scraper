The Tax department has demanded Rs 550 crores from Cadbury's Indian arm for its factory in Himachal Pradesh. Authorities allege Cadbury misused the state's tax holiday scheme as their factory was not operational when the holiday ended in March 2010. Cadbury is disputing the charge as it claims its factory has been operational since 2009.
