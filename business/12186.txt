The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has given a clean chit to the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), after a scrutiny of its investments in public sector banks. Earlier, the RBI had expressed concerns over LIC’s investments, saying it can "affect the financial stability” of the economy, after the latter increased its stake in several public sector banks last year.
