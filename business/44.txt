A fake cryptocurrency firm, Miroskii, has listed Hollywood actor Ryan Gosling among their team members as an "experienced graphic designer" under the name Kevin Belanger. A Twitter user then pointed out that the portraits of most of Miroskii's team members were fake. Reacting to this, a user tweeted, "Ryan Gosling just arrived at the Oscars wearing a Miroskii t-shirt."
