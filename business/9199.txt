US bank Wells Fargo's CEO John Stumpf will forgo $41 million in stocks and salary to keep his job after the bank was fined $190 million for allegedly creating over 2 million unauthorised accounts. Stumpf was earlier asked to resign for his "gutless leadership" after he blamed low-wage employees for the scam.
