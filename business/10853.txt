According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) revised rules, domestic airlines can now import aircraft that are up to 18 years old into the country. Till now, aircraft over 15 years old were not allowed to be imported. The move is reportedly aimed at boosting regional air connectivity and enabling operators to expand their fleet.
