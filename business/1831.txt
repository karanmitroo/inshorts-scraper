Indian Railways has increased the monthly cap on tickets booked on the IRCTC portal from six to 12 for Aadhaar-verified passengers. The move aims to encourage passengers to link the 12-digit unique numbers to their online booking accounts on IRCTC. However, passengers can continue to book up to six tickets a month without validating their Aadhaar number.
