PM Narendra Modi has said demonetisation is not the end but the beginning of a "long, deep and constant" battle against black money. This followed the BJP Parliamentary Party passing a unanimous resolution endorsing his "great crusade". The lower classes have suffered most due to black money and the government is working to rid India of these evils, Modi added.
