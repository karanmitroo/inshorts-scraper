Chinese PC maker Lenovo has become the latest company to remove three Indian e-tailers - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon India - from its authorised sellers list. The company alleged that these e-tailers were selling heavily discounted Lenovo products, thereby hurting margins considerably. The move comes a few months after Nikon removed Flipkart and Snapdeal from its authorised sellers list.
