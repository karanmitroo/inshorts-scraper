Former UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani on Thursday said that with new digital payments systems like BHIM and UPI, around 15-20% of the personal consumption expenditure will become digital in next one year. Adding that demonetisation gave a sense of urgency to create a digital payment infrastructure, Nilekani said it has also accelerated the building of an advanced digital financial infrastructure.
