Markets regulator Sebi on Saturday barred 'wilful loan defaulters' from raising public funds through stocks and bonds, and from taking board positions at listed companies. Such defaulters will also be barred from setting up market intermediaries like mutual funds and brokerage firms. The restrictions will apply to any individual or company declared as a wilful defaulter as per RBI norms.
