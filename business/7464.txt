The government expects all the demonetised currency notes of ₹500 and ₹1,000 in circulation to come back to the banking system, said Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia. This would help the tax authority trace the transactions and tax black money hoarders, he added. An estimated ₹11 lakh crore has been deposited in banks so far.
