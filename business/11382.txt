US biotechnology firm Monsanto on Wednesday revealed it has received an unsolicited takeover proposal from German chemicals major Bayer. The Monsanto board is reviewing the proposal, it added. Reportedly, the merger, if it goes ahead, will create the world's largest agricultural company. Notably, an earlier bid by Monsanto to acquire Swiss agriculture biotech major Syngenta had fallen apart.
