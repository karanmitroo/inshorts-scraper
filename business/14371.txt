A special clearance mechanism to ease investments from Germany and the European Union is expected to be announced on Monday by India as German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for a three-day visit. Germany is India's largest European trading partner and the country's eighth largest foreign direct investor since 2000. Companies such as Airbus, Siemens, and Deutsche Bank are accompanying Merkel.
