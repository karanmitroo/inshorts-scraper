Jharkhand on Wednesday became the third state to ratify the Constitution Amendment Bill allowing the imposition of Goods and Services Tax (GST). The state Assembly passed the bill in a special session convened for the purpose. Earlier, Assam and Bihar had also ratified the constitutional amendment, which needs to be passed by at least half of the state legislatures.
