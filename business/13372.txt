In an attempt to improve the public image after the emissions scandal, Volkswagen is reportedly planning to drop the famous "Das Auto" slogan in the coming advertising campaign. "Wherever our logo appears in future, it will be backed by the new brand slogan 'Volkswagen'," a spokesman said. Notably, the international slogan "Das Auto" means "The Car" in German.
