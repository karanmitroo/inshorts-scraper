The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Calcutta High Court order which had upheld the land acquisition by the then CPI (M)-led West Bengal Government in 2006 to facilitate Tata Motors to set up its Nano plant in Singur. Further, the court directed the state government to take the land's possession and distribute to its land-owners within 12 weeks.
