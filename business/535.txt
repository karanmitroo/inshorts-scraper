Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said that Indian markets are down due to weak global sentiment and not because of the new Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax. The government has proposed 10% LTCG tax on equity gains of more than â‚¹1 lakh in the Budget. "It is very unfortunate that our move came at a wrong time," Adhia added.
