Europe's second-largest steel producer, Tata, is in talks to sell loss-making European operations, including mills in northern England and Scotland to Geneva-based Klesch Group. Tata employs 30,500 people in Europe, including 17,500 in Britain. The company came into the European steel market with the acquisition of Corus in 2007, just before the financial crisis.
