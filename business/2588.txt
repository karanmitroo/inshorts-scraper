McDonald's India has written to its vendors asking them to stop doing business with Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), the north and east India licensee of McDonald's. CPRL MD Vikram Bakshi has said that McDonald's is indirectly pressurising vendors to stop supplies to 169 restaurants run by CPRL. Notably, McDonald's India has terminated its franchise agreement with CPRL.
