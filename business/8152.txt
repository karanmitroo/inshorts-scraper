Multinational conglomerate Adani's $21.7 billion mining project in Australia received an exemption from Queensland's new water laws, by virtue of an amendment passed by the state. The amendment recognises the work Adani has already done to manage water impacts, and it avoids further delay in the project, the company said. The project has been through two "significant" cases already.
