The government on Monday raised the import duty on wheat from 10% to 25% until March 31, 2016. The ministry said that the hike is due to a “consistent fall in international prices of wheat and the anticipated adverse impact of increased imports.” An import duty of 10% was imposed for the first time since 2006 in August.
