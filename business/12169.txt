A new drug to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Bedaquiline, will be made available from on Monday after it became the first TB drug to get a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in over 40 years. The drug will be available in six public hospitals across India. Notably, India has the highest prevalence of TB in the world.
