Indian Cellular Association President Pankaj Mohindroo on Wednesday said that India is probably the worst country to do business in. He criticised India's business climate saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. He further said that lack of ease of doing business is very upsetting to the industry.
