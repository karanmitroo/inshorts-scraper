Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi reportedly left India on January 1, much before the CBI received complaints about a $1.77 billion-fraud linked to his firms. His brother Nishal Modi, a Belgian citizen, also left the country on the same day. His wife Ami, a US citizen, and business partner Mehul Choksi, the promoter of Gitanjali Gems, reportedly departed on January 6.
