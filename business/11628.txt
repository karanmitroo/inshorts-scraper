The auction of defunct Kingfisher Airlines' brand and trademarks on Saturday by a consortium of banks did not attract any bidders. The assets were set at a reserved price of â‚¹366.70 crore in a bid to recover loans from beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya. Notably, an earlier auction of Kingfisher House, the airline's erstwhile headquarters, had also failed to find bidders.
