Ajay Singh-controlled budget carrier SpiceJet has moved the Supreme Court against a Delhi high court order asking it to deposit ₹579 crore in a share transfer dispute. SpiceJet has filed the appeal against its previous owner Kalanithi Maran-promoted KAL Airways. Notably, Maran sought ₹2,000 crore in compensation from Singh and SpiceJet for causing losses by failing to honour an agreement.
