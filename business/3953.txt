United Airlines has apologised to a passenger who was forced to hold her 27-month-old son on her lap for three-and-a-half hours after an employee gave the toddler's purchased seat to a standby flier. The woman had paid $1,000 (â‚¹65,000) each for two tickets because children over the age of 2 are required to have their own seat on the airline.
