Founder and former CEO of Chesapeake Energy Aubrey McClendon died in a car accident on Wednesday, a day after he was charged with rigging bids for oil and natural gas leases. The 56-year old billionaire is credited with pioneering the practice of hydraulic fracturing that led to the US shale gas boom and the subsequent fall in oil prices globally.
