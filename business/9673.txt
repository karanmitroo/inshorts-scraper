India’s biggest energy explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Wednesday posted a 21.1% year-on-year decline in its net profit to ₹4,233 crore for the quarter ended June. Further, the state-run explorer's gross revenue also dropped by 21.41% to ₹17,784 crore. Losses were primarily attributed to a slump in oil prices along with a fall in its output.
