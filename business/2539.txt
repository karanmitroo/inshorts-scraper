Anti-virus software McAfee's Founder John McAfee has slammed JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon for calling Bitcoin a 'fraud'. McAfee, whose company MGT Capital Investments mines Bitcoin, said the miners invest heavily in supercomputing power and electricity to create Bitcoins, giving it value. "Sure it will rise and fall as all new technologies are...it is certainly not a fraud," he added.
