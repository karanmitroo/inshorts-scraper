Multiple Samsung Note 7 users have reported that the company is resisting compensation for the damages caused when their handsets caught fire. This comes amid a recall of Note 7 while several cases of the handset catching fire were reported. "They (Samsung) weren't going to pay replacement costs of any damaged items", an owner whose Note 7 caught fire said.
