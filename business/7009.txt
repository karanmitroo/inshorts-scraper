Finland became the first country in Europe to trial a project to pay unemployed citizens a basic monthly income of €560 (around ₹40,000), in a move to reduce poverty and boost employment. The two-year trial with 2,000 randomly picked citizens began on Sunday. Notably, the number of unemployed people stood at 2,13,000 in November 2016, unchanged from the previous year.
