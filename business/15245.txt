All five franchisees of BSNL across Kashmir have shut down their SIM recharge facility, crippling the company's services, after terrorists blasted a BSNL mobile tower in Srinagar on Monday. Other telecom companies like Airtel, Vodafone and Aircel have already curtailed their services following militants' threats and attacks on towers. About 50% of the valley is now without the mobile network.
