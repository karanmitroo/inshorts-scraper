A 17th-century pub, holding the record for being the highest in the UK, is going on sale for £900,000 (nearly ₹7.6 crore). It stands 1,732 feet above sea level and was named the highest in the UK by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1976. The landlady said the new owner will need to have stamina, eccentricity, and love.
