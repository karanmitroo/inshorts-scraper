Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will raise its first ever debt of ₹25,000 crore to partly fund the ₹37,000 crore acquisition of government's 51.11% stake in HPCL. ONGC has about ₹13,000 crore in cash, and would need to borrow the rest to fund the acquisition. Notably, the board of ONGC last month gave in-principle approval for the acquisition.
