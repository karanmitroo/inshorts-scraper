Oil prices continued to tumble on Thursday, with Brent crude prices falling over 5% to $32.16 per barrel, their lowest intraday level since April 2004. Analysts attributed the plunge to concerns over the worsening situation of the economic slowdown in China, the worldâ€™s biggest consumer of commodities. Oil prices have dropped by nearly 70% since mid-2014.
