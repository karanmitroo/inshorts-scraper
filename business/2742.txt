Axis Bank's new film shows how Indian moms are redefining their relationship with their sons. The film, which focuses on the positive progressive equations that new age moms and sons are building across the country today, is central to its new home loans scheme, the bank states. Under this scheme, Axis Bank will waive off 12 EMIs on home loans.
