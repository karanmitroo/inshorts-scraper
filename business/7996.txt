SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya on Monday said that ATMs will start dispensing ₹50 and ₹20 notes after the initial rush decreases. This comes after the government announced plans to recalibrate ATMs across India to dispense ₹50 and new ₹2,000 notes. The government had demonetised ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes as a part of its fight against black money in the country.
