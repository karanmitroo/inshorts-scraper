An ex-employee of former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli's hedge fund has testified that Shkreli sent a letter to his wife in which he said, "I hope to see you and your four children homeless". Accusing the ex-employee of stealing $1.6 million, Shkreli in the letter said, "making an enemy out of me is a mistake."
