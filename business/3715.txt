Air India is being drained of ₹6,000 crore annually on account of servicing its debt burden, estimated at around ₹50,000 crore, according to Union Minister Jayant Sinha. He added the airline is in losses due to this high debt burden. The government is seeking to disinvest in the carrier, which plunged into losses after merging with Indian Airlines in 2007.
