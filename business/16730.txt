The government is looking to re-impose the curbs on gold imports, as the trade deficit worsened to an 18-month high of $14 billion in September following a 450% rise in gold imports. This comes only few months after the govt had relaxed the gold import rules. Earlier, the govt had imposed quantitative restrictions on gold imports in August 2013.
