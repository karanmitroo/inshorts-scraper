Dairy cooperative Amul's first refrigerated parcel van loaded with Amul Butter has been dispatched from Gujarat's Palanpur to Delhi on Saturday. This comes nearly a month after Amul approached Railways on Twitter with a proposal to use its refrigerated parcel vans to transport butter. Following this, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted, "From Gujarat to Delhi, made and transported with love."
