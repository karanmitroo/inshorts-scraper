Markets regulator Sebi has tightened its norms for mutual fundsâ€™ (MF) exposure to riskier corporate bonds by capping the investment limit in bonds of a single company at 10%. The single sector exposure limit was also lowered from 30% to 25%. This would reduce risks arising on account of high exposure in the wake of events pertaining to credit downgrades.
