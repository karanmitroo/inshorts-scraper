Hinduja Ventures has launched a satellite-based digital cable distribution platform on which it will spend ₹5,000 crore over the next one and a half years. Headend-in-The-Sky (HITS), launched under the brand NXT Digital, will directly compete with Direct-to-Home (DTH) services. The platform has been reportedly rolled out as a push to the nation’s Digital India and Make in India initiatives.
