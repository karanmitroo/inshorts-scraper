US-based startup Trigger Finance has created a tool called 'Trump Tiggers' that notifies users whenever US President-elect Donald Trump tweets about a publicly traded stock they hold. These notifications are aimed at helping users manage their holdings based on the market's reaction to Trump's remarks. For example, Boeing's stock fell 1.4% after Trump's tweet on rejecting Air Force One plane.
