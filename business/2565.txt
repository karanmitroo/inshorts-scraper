CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra said, “Our message to assessees is that your investments are on our radar. If you're not filing returns, we'll catch you.” Chandra said 14,000 people who purchased properties worth over ₹1 crore but didn't file returns will face action. The government will soon conclude probe into 1 lakh individuals' dealings over suspected tax evasion, he added.
