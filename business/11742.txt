Gold imports for the fiscal 2015-16 declined by around 8% to $31.72 billion amid a fall in prices in the global and domestic markets, according to data from the Commerce Ministry. Meanwhile, imports in the month of March fell by 80.48% year-on-year to $972.96 million as the nationwide jewellers' strike opposing the 1% levy on non-silver jewellery suppressed the demand.
