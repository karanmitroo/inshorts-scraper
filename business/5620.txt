Europe's largest paint company and Dulux owner AkzoNobel on Wednesday rejected its US competitor's acquisition offer even after the deal amount was raised to $24.2 billion. This is the second time AkzoNobel has rejected PPG's offer after rejecting an initial $22 billion bid earlier this month. The latest offer is too low and would lead to job losses, said AkzoNobel.
