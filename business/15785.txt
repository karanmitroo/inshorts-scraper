SEBI on Wednesday relaxed the account opening norms for individual investors by announcing a simplified account opening form called Saral AOF. It also eased the process of submitting documents for address proof. "Individual investors may submit only one documentary proof of address (either residence/correspondence or permanent) while opening a trading account and/or demat account," SEBI said.
