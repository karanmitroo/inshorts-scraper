Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has confirmed it lost about $524 million after suffering a hack which stole 500 million NEM tokens, said to be the biggest cryptocurrency hack ever. NEM, the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 11% over a 24-hour period following the hack. The previous largest theft was pegged at $450 million in 2014 from a Tokyo-based exchange.
