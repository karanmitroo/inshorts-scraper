For the second consecutive year, SpiceJet's auditors have raised concerns about its ability to stay afloat, as its operating losses have completely eroded its net worth. The airline in its response said its losses were 50% higher than its net worth. SpiceJet posted a net loss of Rs.192-crore for the year ended March-31, down from Rs.605.8-crore a year earlier.
