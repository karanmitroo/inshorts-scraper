American conglomerate Johnson & Johnson was on Monday ordered by a US jury to pay $72 million to the family of a woman whose death from ovarian cancer was linked to the use of the company's talc-based powders. Notably, the company is facing claims that it has failed for decades to warn customers that its talc-based products could cause cancer.
