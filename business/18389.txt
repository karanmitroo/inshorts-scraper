In yet another high-profile exit at Infosys, Ashok Vemuri, director and head of Americas and global head of manufacturing and engineering services has resigned. Mr. Vemuri, widely considered to be a contender for the next Infosys CEO, was the highest paid Indian executive (Rs.5-crore in FY 2012-13). The spate of exits has come since Narayana Murthy took over in June.
