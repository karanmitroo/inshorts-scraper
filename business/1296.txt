Sri Lanka on Saturday formally handed over the southern Hambantota Port to China on a 99-year lease and received $292 million out of the $1.12-billion deal, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. The port will play a key role in China's One Belt One Road initiative by linking ports and roads between China and Europe.
