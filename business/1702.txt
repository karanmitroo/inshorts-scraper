Jet Airways on Wednesday issued a clarification after a fake creative saying, "We beat our competition, not you," was circulated online. The creative seemingly trolled IndiGo after a video of a fight between a passenger and its staffers went viral. Meanwhile, Air India seemingly trolled IndiGo with tweets like "Unbeatable Service" but later deleted them.
