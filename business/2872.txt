Real estate firm Omaxe on Tuesday said that its promoters will take a salary cut of 90% and also forgo their dividend, leading to an annual saving of â‚¹15 crore. The decision has been taken keeping in mind the challenges faced by the real estate industry post demonetisation and implementation of RERA and GST, the company said.
