Mumbai-based Axis Bank on Monday raised $500 million at the London Stock Exchange after it launched India's first internationally-listed certified green bonds. The proceeds of the bond will be invested in green energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects, the bank said. Green bonds are tax-exempt bonds issued to fund projects that have positive environmental and climate benefits.
