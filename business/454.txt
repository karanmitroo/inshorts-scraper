A US family has sued Starbucks claiming that their two-year-old daughter drank a beverage tainted with an employee's blood in 2016. They alleged Starbucks knew that an employee had been bleeding, but didn't adequately keep the worker away from customers' drinks. Starbucks had reportedly offered each family member $1,000 after the incident and promised free drinks for a week.
