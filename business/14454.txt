The emission crisis has prompted Switzerland on Friday to suspend the sale of Volkswagen diesel-engine cars. Some 180,000 vehicles made by Volkswagen's Audi, Seat, Skoda and VW brands between 2009 and 2014 could be affected by the scandal, the Federal Roads Office said. Cars which meet the Euro 5 emission norms will reportedly be affected by this ban.
