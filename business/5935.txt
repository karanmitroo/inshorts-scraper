A special court has confirmed the Enforcement Directorate's order to attach ₹4,200 crore assets of beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya and associated firms, calling the assets to be “involved in money laundering”. The ED will now move to confiscate these assets. The agency had alleged that these assets were “proceeds generated out of criminal activity” in the default of bank loans.
