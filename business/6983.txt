Oil marketing companies on Tuesday announced they will offer a discount of ₹5 on every LPG refill to customers who book or pay for cylinders online. The move is part of the government’s policy to promote digital transactions post the demonetisation drive. Earlier, the government had announced a 0.75% discount on digital purchases of petrol and diesel from state-owned outlets.
