The country’s biggest mobile wallet owner, Paytm, has asked RBI to raise the limit on money that can be kept in it from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000. Over 85 million people reportedly use Paytm’s wallet services and make transactions worth Rs 700 crore every month. Half a million of these customers spend more than Rs 10,000 through the m-wallet.
