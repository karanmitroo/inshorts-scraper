Stating that Indian diaspora is a valuable partner in the country's journey of development, PM Narendra Modi said, "We want to change brain-drain to brain-gain." Remittance of close to $69 billion (over â‚¹4.7 lakh crore) annually by overseas Indians makes an invaluable contribution to the economy, he said. The diaspora represents the best of Indian culture and values, he added.
