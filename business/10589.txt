The Centre on Monday set up an incubation cell at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade to offer "support" to export startups. The initiative named KITTES (Knowledge for Innovation in Trade and Technology for Entrepreneurial Start-ups), will allow start-ups to expand their business to foreign markets. Further, it will offer expert advice and technical guidance to entrepreneurs at one place.
