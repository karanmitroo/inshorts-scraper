Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as the Chief Executive Officer to focus on new high-end coffee shops. Schultz, who will become executive chairman in 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium stores around the world and setting the brand's "social impact agenda" that includes sending employees to college. Further, COO Kevin Johnson will replace Schultz.
