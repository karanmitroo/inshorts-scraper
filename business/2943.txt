Calgary airport in Canada has been slammed for replacing disabled parking spaces and marking them as spaces for Lexus-branded vehicles. Lexus Canada told the media it was unaware that the airport's marketing campaign would involve the removal of parking spaces for travellers with disabilities. The airport authority also apologised to Lexus Canada, claiming it was "solely responsible" for it.
