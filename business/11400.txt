Japanese automaker Suzuki on Wednesday said it has used fuel-economy testing methods, not compliant with Japanese regulations, on 2.1 million vehicles sold in the nation since 2010. However, the ratings need not be revised as they fall in an acceptable range of deviation, Suzuki claimed. Following the announcement, Suzuki's shares fell 9.37%, the highest decline in over seven years.
