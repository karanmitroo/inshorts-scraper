Retail giant Lotte Group's 94-year-old Founder Shin Kyuk-ho is leaving his post as board director at Lotte's holding company. The decision follows a year-long family feud and a corruption trial. Shin's eldest son, who was dismissed as an executive in 2015, said the founder was removed "against his will". Notably, Shin has been a board member for nearly 70 years.
