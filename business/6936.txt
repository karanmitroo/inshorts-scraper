Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover on Friday said that it was buying a minority stake in connected car technology firm CloudCar and would invest $15 million (over ₹102 crore) in it. In October, JLR, parent Tata Motors, and US-based Ford tested connected cars using technology designed to speed up journeys and cut accidents, the first such trials in Britain.
