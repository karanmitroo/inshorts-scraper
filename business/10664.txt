The Special Investigation Team on black money has recommended that all cash transactions over ₹3 lakh be banned to curb illegal money in the economy. The SIT, which submitted its fifth report to the Supreme Court, also suggested a ₹15 lakh limit on cash holdings. People or industries should be allowed to hold more cash only with permission, it added.
