The new â‚¹1 note, which will be printed with a new design, is the only note to be printed by the Central government and not the RBI. It will have 'Bharat Sarkar' on its masthead. The notes will also have signatures of Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das and Rajiv Mehrishi, who was the Finance Secretary in 2015, when printing started.
