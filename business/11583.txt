State-run Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) might be converted to a Green bank to enable it to access funds from overseas banks, IREDA chief KS Popli said. Green banks provide low-cost financial support to low-carbon projects. Indian banks are perhaps reluctant to fund solar and wind projects in India although no such developer has defaulted on payment, he added.
