Citibank has launched voice verification for its phone banking clients to replace the current authentication process of remembering PINs or answering verification questions. The bank said identifying a user's unique voiceprint will take 15 seconds, down from an average 45 seconds it takes currently. The authentication will be completed automatically while the customers speak to the bank official.
