French bank Societe Generale Chairman Bini Smaghi has called Bitcoin a scam that is used to evade taxes and bypass legislation on money laundering and anti-terrorist financing. He said the people who thought Bitcoin as a new invention will lose money when authorities focus on the dangers of its development. "Only international cooperation can bring in necessary regulation," he added.
