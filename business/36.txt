The UIDAI has directed telecom operators to provide a way by March 15 for subscribers to check if their SIM cards have been linked to their Aadhaar number. The decision was taken after UIDAI found that retailers were misusing Aadhaar authentication facility to issue new SIM cards and using Aadhaar holders' details to verify someone else's SIM cards.
