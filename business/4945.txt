Pakistani journalist Ahmer Naqvi, in a post on Twitter, confused journalist Arnab Goswami with actor Riteish Deshmukh as a joke. Naqvi had tweeted a photo of a billboard advertisement for Goswami's Republic TV with the caption, "Why is Ritesh Deshmukh our national migraine?" Later, Deshmukh responded to Naqvi's post with a picture of himself captioned, "Btw that's my migraine look."
