Former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli's ex-compliance officer revealed that Shkreli ran his hedge-fund and start-up drug company in such a dodgy way that he quit after less than a year. He added he got fed up of watching Shkreli execute questionable and unethical transactions. Notably, Shkreli, who raised an HIV drug's price by 5,400%, is facing a fraud trial.
