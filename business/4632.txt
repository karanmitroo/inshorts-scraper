Ice cream giant Ben & Jerry's is fighting for marriage equality in Australia by banning customers from ordering two scoops of the same flavour. The ban, which covers all 26 Ben & Jerry's stores across Australia, aims to push for swift parliamentary action on marriage equality. "Make marriage equality legal! Love comes in all flavours!" the company said.
