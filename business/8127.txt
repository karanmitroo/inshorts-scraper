The Income Tax department conducted surveys in Delhi, Mumbai, and some other cities in the wake of reports of alleged profiteering and tax evasion by traders in reported conversion of demonetised currency notes. Reports claimed that some traders, jewellers, and hawala dealers were allegedly exchanging now-discontinued currencies at "discounted" prices, thereby profiteering illegally.
