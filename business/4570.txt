The average salary hike in India has dropped from 15.1% in 2007 to 10.2% in 2016, according to an Aon Hewitt survey. Moreover, the figure is expected to drop further to 9.5% in 2017, the worst since 6.6% after the 2009 global recession. The report added that for high-earning people, the 9.5% hike might result in negative real pay increase.
