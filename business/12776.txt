The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to allow auction of coal to non-power sectors like steel, iron and cement. The coal to the non-power sector was previously allocated by an inter-ministerial committee, potentially raising costs for users. The Supreme Court had in August 2014 cancelled over 200 coal block allocations finding them “non-transparent, irregular and arbitrary”.
