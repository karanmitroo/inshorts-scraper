World's largest credit card company Visa's CEO Alfred Kelly has said that he does not view Bitcoin as a "payment system". He further said, "We at Visa won't process transactions that are cryptocurrency-based. We will only process fiat currency-based transactions." He added, "Bitcoin is much more today a commodity that somebody could invest in...somewhat of a speculative commodity."
