The Nagaland Legislative Assembly on Friday ratified the Constitution Amendment Bill allowing the imposition of Goods and Services Tax (GST). “A purely consuming state like Nagaland will benefit even more since GST is based on the destination principle,” state Minister Kiyanilie Peseyie said. The bill requires at least 15 states' assent before the President can notify it as a law.
