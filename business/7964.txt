The Cabinet on Tuesday hiked the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for the rabi or winter season crops. MSP for the best variety of wheat was raised by ₹100 a quintal (100 kg) while the most expensive pulses variety saw its farm-end price go up by ₹550 a quintal. MSP is the price the government offers to buy a farmers' produce.
