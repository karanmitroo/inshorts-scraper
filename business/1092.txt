The government has said that the Indian economy slowed down in 2016-17, with the gross domestic product (GDP) declining drastically from 8% the previous year to 7.1%. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the slower growth reflected lower growth in the industry and services sectors. He added that this was due to many factors including structural, fiscal and monetary.
