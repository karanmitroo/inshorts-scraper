SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya on Friday said, "Even though ₹1,40,000 crore has been deposited in SBI, ₹500 notes are in short supply at the moment." Stating that normalcy is returning in the banks, she said, "It took us time to react too." Further, she said that there wouldn't be any exchange of notes on Saturday.
