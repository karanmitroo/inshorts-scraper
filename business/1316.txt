Reserve Bank of New Zealand Acting Governor Grant Spencer has said that Bitcoin is too unstable to be useful in the future. Adding that the cryptocurrency looks "remarkably" like a bubble, he said, "With a bubble, you never know how far it's going to go before it comes down." Notably, Bitcoin has soared more than 1,500% this year.
