The BSE Sensex on Wednesday fell by 119.45 points to close at 25,960.03, while the NSE Nifty lost 32.70 points to settle at 7,896.25. Analysts attributed the fall to profit bookings and investorsâ€™ exit from long positions ahead of the expiry of derivatives contracts on Thursday. Tata Steel emerged as the top gainer while Infosys ended as the major loser.
