Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhaar platform, the merchant interface of the BHIM App, that will allow people to make payments through the fingerprint scanner. The service will use Aadhaar numbers linked to bank accounts, and payments will be finalised only after customers keep their finger on the merchant's biometric machine connected to the app through a smartphone.
