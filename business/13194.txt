Oil prices on Tuesday neared an 11-year low as they slumped more than 2% amid Middle East tensions, based on a strong showing from the US Dollar and increasing United States crude inventories. The price of Brent crude fell 80 cents to settle at $36.42 per barrel. The 11-year low of $35.98 per barrel was recorded just before Christmas 2015.
