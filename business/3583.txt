A glitch in Air India's reservation system led to overbooking of a flight, which prompted protests among passengers in Kolkata. The flight had maximum capacity of 144 but 194 people showed up, leaving 50 passengers stranded. "We do have 2-3% overbookings but...it was 31% on the...flight. The passengers were justifiably furious and we didn't have any explanations," an official said.
