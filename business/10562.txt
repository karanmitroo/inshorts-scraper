Mumbaiâ€™s Siddhivinayak Temple has opened a demat account to enable its devotees to offer shares of listed companies as donations. However, Chairman of the temple's trust Narendra Murari Rane said the shares will be sold the same day or the next day, irrespective of market conditions. In 2015, Andhra Pradesh-based Tirumala Venkateswara Temple had also started accepting shares as donations.
