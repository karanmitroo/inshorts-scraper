Vijay Mallya's luxury superyacht worth $93 million (over ₹600 crore) has been impounded in Malta by a trade union over non-payment of more than $1 million (₹6.5 crore) in wages to the crew. More than 40 crew, including several Indians, Britons, and eastern European workers, have not been paid since September last year when Mallya abandoned the 95-metre 'Indian Empress'.
