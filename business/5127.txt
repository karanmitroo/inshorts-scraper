The government has denounced some petrol pump operators' decision to keep outlets closed on Sundays, saying this will be of inconvenience to the public. In a tweet, the government stated major dealer associations are not participating in the closure. Earlier, a petroleum dealers' consortium said fuel outlets in seven states and Puducherry will be shut every Sunday starting May 14.
