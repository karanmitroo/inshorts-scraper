US magazine publisher Salon is requesting readers using ad blockers to mine cryptocurrency for an ad-free website. The website began presenting visitors using ad-blockers with the option to "suppress ads" in exchange for "allowing Salon to use your unused computing power". The cryptocurrency Monero will be mined for as long as the user remains on the site.
