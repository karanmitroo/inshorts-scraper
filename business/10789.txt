The World Bank on Thursday said it will lend over $1 billion to India for its solar energy projects. This comes after PM Narendra Modi sought climate change funds from the World Bank President. This is the global lender's biggest solar aid to any country. Notably, India plans to increase its solar potential 30 times to 100 gigawatts by 2020.
