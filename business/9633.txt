World food prices rose by nearly 7% in August, their highest level since May 2015, as against the year-ago period, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said on Thursday. The rise followed increases in dairy, oils, and sugar prices which offset the drop in cereal prices, the United Nations food agency stated. The index had hit a seven-year low in January.
