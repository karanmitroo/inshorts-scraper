The cash in the country's ATMs is falling short by 30% even five months after demonetisation, according to Cash Logistics Association. The shortage was attributed to banks' tendency to ensure enough cash for their customers at branches. Notably, 86% of the money in circulation was wiped out from the economy when government announced demonetisation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes.
