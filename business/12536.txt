Belgium-based securities settlement company Euroclear has reportedly agreed to a model suggested by the RBI to settle Indian government debt papers in the overseas market. Under the model, the overseas debts will be cleared in India through Indian brokers. Further, foreign institutional investors using the Euroclear platform to trade in India need not register in India to settle their investments.
