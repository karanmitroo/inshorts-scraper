Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani has credited wife Nita, saying she has built a bigger brand of IPL team Mumbai Indians than Reliance itself. "A lot of us at Reliance say that we are very proud of what Reliance has done...but I think with both her school and cricket, Nita has built a bigger brand for Reliance," said Mukesh.
