The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Sebi to sell properties of Sahara Group worth ₹40,000 crore to recover investors' money worth ₹36,000 crore it collected via illegal bonds. The court asked not to sell the properties for less than 90% of market value, but if the bids are below the benchmark, the regulator will have to take the court's permission.
