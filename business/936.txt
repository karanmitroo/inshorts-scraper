The Supreme Court has exempted Jaypee Associates' directors from appearing in every court hearing on the grounds of their age, as requested by company's independent directors' counsel. The court reiterated its order that its directors couldn't leave the country without the court's permission. Jaypee is facing a case after it failed to deliver flats of around 32,000 homebuyers on time.
