Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Wednesday recommended that the premium 700 MHz spectrum be auctioned at a reserve price of around â‚¹11,500 crore. The premium spectrum is more efficient and can reduce the cost of delivering mobile services by at least 70%. However, telecom operators requested a delay claiming they need more time to develop the device ecosystem.
