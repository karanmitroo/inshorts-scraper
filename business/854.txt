Former Andhra Bank director Anup Prakash Garg has been sent to a seven-day Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody in a ₹5,000-crore bank fraud case. Gujarat-based Sterling Biotech had taken loans of over ₹5,000 crore from an Andhra Bank-led consortium which turned into bad loans. Garg is suspected to have received ₹1.52 crore between 2008 and 2009 from Sterling directors.
