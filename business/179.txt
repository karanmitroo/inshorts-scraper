PNB fraud-accused Nirav Modi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has said he wouldn't advise Nirav to return to India for investigations because the "atmosphere was not conducive". Adding that he would advise Nirav to appear for the trial, Aggarwal said the case would not stand for "even five minutes" in the court of law. Nirav Modi had left India on January 1.
