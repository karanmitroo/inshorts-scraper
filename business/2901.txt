The government has retained a clause that prevents Air India from being sold to a foreign airline under its consolidated foreign direct investment (FDI) policy released on Monday. The government said the rule allowing foreign carriers to own up to 49% stake in Indian airlines does not apply to Air India. Notably, the government is hoping to privatise Air India.
