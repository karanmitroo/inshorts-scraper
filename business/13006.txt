According to a study, a 36% share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030 would increase global GDP by nearly $1.3 trillion. This would generate millions of jobs and help countries like India which are dependent on importing oil and gas. Japan would see the largest positive GDP impact of 2.3%, followed by Australia, Brazil and Mexico.
