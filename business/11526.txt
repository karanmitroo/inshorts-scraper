Saudi Arabia on Saturday issued a royal decree replacing the country's 80-year-old Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi with national oil company Saudi Aramco's Chairman Khalid al-Falih, as part of a broader cabinet reshuffle. In power since 1995, al-Naimi had reportedly led the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) decision in 2014 to not restrain oil production amid global oversupply.
