Germany's automotive watchdog has asked Volkswagen-owned carmaker Audi to recall 1.27 lakh diesel cars after it detected illicit emission control devices. The ministry said the engines designed to meet the latest Euro 6 emissions standards offered "no reduction" of harmful nitrogen oxides under real driving conditions. Out of 1.27 lakh cars involved in the recall, 77,600 are registered in Germany.
