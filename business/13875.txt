Multinational steel-making company Tata Steel reported a 21.9% rise year-on-year in its net consolidated profit in the quarter ended September to ₹1528.7 crore. However, net sales for the company went down by 18% to ₹29,068.54 crore year-on-year owing to cheaper steel imports from China. The rise in profit was majorly triggered by the "sale of quoted investments" during the quarter.
