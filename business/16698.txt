HDFC Bank Thursday reported a net profit of Rs 1,357 crore, a 7.2% growth Y-o-Y, for the Jul-Sep quarter. The profit was largely in line with Bloomberg estimates of Rs.1,362 crore. Notably, it is after 21 quarters that the profit growth has slipped into single digits. The slower growth can be attributed to increase in provisioning and tax, say analysts.
