The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year on Tuesday, citing a sharp slowdown in China trade and weak commodity prices that are hammering emerging markets. It said the world economy would grow at 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017, both years down 0.2% from its previous estimates.
