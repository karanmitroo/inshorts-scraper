The Uttar Pradesh government has ordered an inspection of all petrol pumps across the state in connection with the multi-crore petrol scam. The state police had recently found petrol pumps cheating on customers by installing a chip in dispensing machines, which reduced output by 5%-10%. A Special Task Force had earlier arrested 23 people including petrol pump owners and technicians.
