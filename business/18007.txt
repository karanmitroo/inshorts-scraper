In order to reduce infrastructure and service costs, Reliance Jio Infocom and Airtel on Tuesday joined hands for sharing telecom infrastructure. The new arrangement will include optic-fiber networks, submarine cable networks, and internet broadband services. The arrangement could, in future, be extended to other mutually benefiting areas like 3G and 4G services, a joint statement by the two companies said.
