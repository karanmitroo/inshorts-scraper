Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro has announced the creation of a new cryptocurrency in a bid to ease the country's economic crisis. It will be called the 'Petro' and will be backed by the nation's oil, gold, gas, and diamond reserves. He said the Petro would help Venezuela recover financially after the US imposed sanctions.
