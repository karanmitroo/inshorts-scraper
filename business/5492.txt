Wynn Resorts sued the former wife of its Founder Steve Wynn for secretly letting her lawyers copy company hard drives to get out of an agreement that ties her $1 billion stake in the firm. The casino company accused Elaine Wynn of breaching her contract. Notably, there has been a five-year dispute between Wynn, his ex-wife, and his ex-business partner.
