Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the two countries can nullify US sanctions by replacing the use of US dollar with national currencies in trade transactions and isolate the US. This comes amid ongoing tensions between the US and Iran over the latter's missile programme and allegations that Russia rigged the 2016 US election.
