Japanese prosecutors have raided the headquarters of at least two of Japan's biggest construction companies over alleged collusion on bids for the magnetic levitation (maglev) railway line. This comes after officials launched a probe into Obayashi Corp, another construction company, for suspected bid-rigging in maglev-related contracts. The project is expected to cost about $80 billion.
