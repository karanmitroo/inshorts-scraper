The benchmark Sensex and Nifty continued their losing streak for the second day after they fell 321.25 and 90.85 points to close at 23,088.93 and 7,018.70 points respectively, amid sustained capital outflows by foreign funds. Falling crude oil prices and weak global cues dampened investor sentiment. Investors also remained cautious ahead of the Railway Budget on Thursday, according to analysts.
