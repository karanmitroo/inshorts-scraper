Banking major Barclays CEO Jes Staley, in an email to employees, admitted he had got “too personally involved” in his attempt to identify a whistleblower.  While apologising he said he acted because he believed the whistleblower’s actions were intended to maliciously smear the executive involved. Notably, Staley is facing a probe and pay cut over the incident.
