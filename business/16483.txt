The govt eased foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for the construction sector on Wednesday. Under the new rules, 100% FDI will be permitted to overseas investors, which will allow them to exit a project even before its completion. In other key changes, the minimum built-up area requirement has been cut from 50k sq metres to 20k sq metres.
