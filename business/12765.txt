Snapping its three-day losing run, the rupee on Thursday jumped 52 paise to log its biggest single-day gain in 2016 and ended at 67.55 against the US dollar. This was majorly triggered by fresh selling of dollars by banks and exporters, which was helped by a recovery in equities. The rupee had dropped by 29 paise in previous three days.
