Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said the country's GDP growth is not "justifiable and equitable" unless the benefits are "clear and evident" in the agriculture sector. Agri-sector is the top priority as the maximum population is dependent on it, he added. Notably, the government has pegged agriculture and allied sector growth at 2.1% this fiscal from 4.9% in 2016-17.
