Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said one thing he couldn't dare tell his father was "dad you don't get it". He added this generation is different and he receives a lot of remarks from his children. Ambani said, "My father is my biggest influence, he treated me as his friend. I hope I can treat my children the same way."
