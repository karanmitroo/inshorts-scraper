The Bombay High Court on Thursday overruled an Income Tax Appellate Tribunal verdict that demanded enforcement of the Income Tax Department's ₹8,500 crore transfer pricing order on Vodafone. The dispute is related to the sale of Vodafone's Ahmedabad-based call centre business and it demanded ₹8,500 crore be added to its taxable income for the financial year 2008.
