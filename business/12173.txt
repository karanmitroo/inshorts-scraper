The government has formally withdrawn the recognition of Delhi Stock Exchange (DSE) after it was derecognised by markets regulator Sebi in November 2014 for "serious irregularities" in its functioning. The DSE board had overlooked the "due transfer of shares in demat accounts and receipt of funds by the appointed date", the Sebi order had said. DSE was incorporated in 1947.
