After being found guilty of fraud, Martin Shkreli, nicknamed "Pharma Bro" and once dubbed "most hated man in America", said, "This was a witch hunt of epic proportions." "Maybe they found one or two broomsticks, but...we've been acquitted of the most important charges." Notably, Shkreli was found guilty on three of eight charges over deceiving investors in failed hedge funds.
