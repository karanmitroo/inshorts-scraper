Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal at the launch of India's first payments bank said, "Many wallet companies are coming to us to get acquired by us...We don't see much value in putting money behind those companies." Airtel has an e-wallet service called 'Airtel Money' which will be connected to its payments bank, letting users transfer their balance and earn interest.
