The benchmark indices on Monday ended with losses as the Sensex plunged 373.94 points to close at 28,294.28, while the Nifty fell by 108.50 points to settle at 8,723.05 amid weak global cues. Lower oil prices and decline on the Wall Street last week dampened market sentiments. Coal India emerged as the major gainer while ONGC was the biggest loser.
