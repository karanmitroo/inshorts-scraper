RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya has called for setting up an online trading platform to sell bad loans similar to the one in the US. He said banks, asset reconstruction companies, and credit rating agencies should develop such a mechanism. Such a platform will help India achieve a "thriving market" for the sale of bad loans, he added.
