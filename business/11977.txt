Rejecting calls for disclosing major loan defaulters' names, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday said that doing so ”may create both a loss of business as well as an undue anxiety and panic, and therefore, chill business activity". The RBI, on March 30, had submitted a list of 150 defaulters who owe banks over ₹500 crore to the Supreme Court.
