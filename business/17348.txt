The beverage firm, Coca-Cola, has been accused of using a Â£20 million anti-obesity drive to distract attention from its contribution to Britain's obesity epidemic. The drinks giant plans to pour millions into fitness programme called Coca-Cola Zero ParkLives, offering thousands of free sessions and coaching across 70 parks in England. Nutrition campaigners have labelled the scheme as "obscene".
