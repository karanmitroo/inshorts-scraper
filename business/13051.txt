Extending losses for the second straight day against the American currency, the Indian rupee slipped to a fresh 28-month low of 67.59 against the US dollar on Friday. Analysts attributed the decline to falling oil prices and negative sentiment in domestic markets leading to persistent foreign capital outflows. Foreign portfolio investors pumped out $171.71 million from equity markets on Thursday.
