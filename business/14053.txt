Indians reportedly invested over $2 billion in real estate in Dubai during the first half of 2015. "According to Dubai government's data, Indians were the most prolific foreign investors," said Sumansa Exhibitions, which organises property expos. Lower property rates and RBIâ€™s recent move allowing investors to spend up to $2,50,000 on overseas property boosted Indian sentiment, it added.
