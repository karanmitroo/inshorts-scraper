European oil firms and commodity traders including Trafigura, Vitol, and BP export highly polluting 'dirty' fuels to Africa, according to a report by Swiss NGO Public Eye. The NGO said traders exploit weaker African standards and dump cheaper fuels for maximising profits. It added that two-thirds of the fuel samples from Africa had 150 times more sulphur than European limits.
