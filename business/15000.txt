The finance ministry is planning to allocate extra Rs 12,000 crore to PSU banks which are burdened with bad loans. This would be the first round of funding under a strategy to enable these banks to resume lending. Banks like Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India and Allahabad Bank are expected to be among the beneficiaries.
