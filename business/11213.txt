The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty on Tuesday snapped their 5-day gaining streak to end 57.64 and 18.40 points lower at 26,667.96 and 8,160.10 respectively. The fall was registered on account of the absence of any major positive triggers which could take the markets higher amid profit booking in frontline blue-chip stocks, analysts said.
