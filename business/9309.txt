Budget carriers Indigo and GoAir on Friday filed objections after the debt recovery tribunal directed them to withhold payments to French aircraft maker Airbus, which did not repay ₹196 crore to the Vijay Mallya-led Kingfisher Airlines. The budget carriers were asked to deposit the money with the consortium of 17 banks, to which the now-defunct airline owes over ₹9,000 crore.
