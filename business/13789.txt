Online auto classifieds platform CarTrade on Thursday reportedly acquired CarWale from Germany’s Axel Springer for about $80-90 million. After the acquisition, both platforms will operate independently. “CarWale will focus on being the new car brand, while CarTrade will be the used-car brand,” said Vinay Sanghi, Founder of CarTrade. As per the deal, BikeWale will also be a part of CarTrade.
