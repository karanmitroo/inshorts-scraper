Mondelez International, which makes Cadbury products has said that CEO Irene Rosenfeld will step down in November. Rosenfeld will remain Chairman until March when she'll be replaced by Dirk Van de Put, current McCain Foods CEO. After becoming CEO of Kraft in 2006, Rosenfeld acquired Cadbury for nearly $20 billion and subsequently split Kraft into two, creating Mondelez.
