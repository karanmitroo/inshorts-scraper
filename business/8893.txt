Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday demanded an immediate ban on ₹500, ₹1,000 notes to wipe out black money in the country. Noting that politics has become a "shelter" for the corrupt, Naidu said the ban would put an end to "buying of votes". He praised Centre's Income Declaration Scheme as an effort to unearth black money.
