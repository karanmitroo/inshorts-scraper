The Nikkei India's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a three-month low of 51.4 in February from 54.3 in January, as the Indian economy softened in the month and increase in prices led to lukewarm demand. Meanwhile, the Nikkei's Composite Index, which maps both manufacturing and service sectors, fell to 51.2 from January's 11-month high of 53.3.
