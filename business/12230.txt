India cannot surpass China's GDP growth rate as predicted by the West, said a state-run Chinese newspaper on Thursday. It claimed the forecasts were unrealistic, as India was not a dominant player in international economic arena yet. The IMF earlier predicted that China's GDP growth would decelerate to 6.3% in 2016, and India's GDP growth would be 7.3% between 2015-2016.
