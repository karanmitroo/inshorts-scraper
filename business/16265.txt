The Union Cabinet cleared the largest ever 2G spectrum auction on Monday, which will go to sale next month. The auction will offer 380.75 megahertz of second generation (2G) spectrum in three bands â€” the premium 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz. The 2100 MHz spectrum might also be auctioned. It is expected to garner at least Rs.64,840 crore.
