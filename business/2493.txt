Exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui has been accused by his former business partner Qu Long, of framing him for crimes he says he did not commit. After having a conviction overturned for embezzling $130 million from a company owned by Guo, Qu Long said he is out for revenge. "I will find a lawyer and make him pay," Qu added.
