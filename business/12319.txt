Financial ratings agency Fitch on Thursday said the non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of India’s banks is likely to “improve marginally to 10.9% in 2015-16 from 11.1% in 2014-15”. According to the agency, the Indian banking system currently has stressed assets of around ₹9 lakh crore. Further, banks will require $140 billion to ensure full Basel-III implementation by 2018-19, Fitch added.
