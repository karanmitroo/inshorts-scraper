The largest Air India employees' union has announced that it will "organise its members for a movement" against the government's decision to privatise the airline. This comes after seven unions of Air India wrote to Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, warning him of an "industrial unrest". They also demanded that the government clear their dues before privatising the airline.
