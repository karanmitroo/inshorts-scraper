Deutsche Bank’s India CEO Ravneet Gill has majored a “rare feat” by bringing the gender diversity of the bank’s top management to 40% females. The six high-profile female leaders at Deutsche Bank contrast the figures of Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, which have one woman each on their executive committees. Gill believes a gender mix in senior management improves efficiency.
