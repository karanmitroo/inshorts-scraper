The RBI has ordered a probe into allegations of irregularities committed by public, private and foreign banks to claim achievements of targets in farmer lending. Among several irregularities, one involved forming fictitious groups with fraudulent documents on farmers' name. The disbursements of crores of agro-credits reportedly never reached the farmers, though targets were shown as achieved.
