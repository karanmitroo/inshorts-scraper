The European Commission on Tuesday proposed a mandatory common tax base for multinationals with total revenue exceeding $816 million a year, reports said. The common tax laws reportedly target firms which shift their profits to avoid tax. This system will "support business, attract investors, promote growth and stop large-scale tax avoidance", an EU official said.
