According to a regulatory filing, Reliance Jio is planning to raise ₹20,000 crore through a rights issue of optionally convertible preference shares (OCPS). OCPS are fixed-income securities that can be turned into a certain number of shares of common stock after a period. This will take the total investment of Reliance Industries in the telecom arm to ₹2.1 lakh crore.
