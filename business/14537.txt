The consumer inflation for the month of August fell to an all-time record low of 3.66% percent year-on-year. Both the wholesale and consumer inflation indices hit record lows in August, increasing expectations of a rate cut at the Reserve Bank's policy review scheduled later this month. The government is expecting the inflation to reach its 6% target by January 2016.
