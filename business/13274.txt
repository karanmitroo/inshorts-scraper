According to multinational auditing firm PwC, Merger and Acquisition (M&A) deals involving Indian companies have slumped over 40% in 2015 to $20 billion compared to $33 billion in 2015. Domestic M&A deals in 2015 also fell to $7.3 billion against $19 billion last year. The drop was attributed to fewer domestic deals and a depreciation in rupee value.
