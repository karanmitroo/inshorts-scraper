India has imposed anti-dumping duty on tempered glass, used for protecting mobile phone screens, from China for five years to protect the domestic industry from below-cost imports. The anti-dumping duty is in the range of $52.85-$136.21 (₹3,389-₹8,733) per tonne on tempered glass imports from China. Notably, anti-dumping duty is to protect domestic industry from an increase in cheap price imports.
