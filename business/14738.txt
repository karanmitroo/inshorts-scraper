Taiwanese smartphone-maker HTC announced a lay-off of over 2,000 jobs on Thursday after it posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss. This will slash the companyâ€™s workforce by 15%. The company lost $252.7 million in the second quarter from a net profit of $2.26 billion in the same period last year. This brought the share price to its lowest in 10 years.
