Delhi's Airport Express Line has reportedly seen a “turnaround”, as its ridership recorded a 50% rise over the previous year when the project was being termed a feared failure. The growth owes to measures including the latest smart-card portability between the Airport Express and other lines, reduction of over 40% in fares and increase in the frequency of trains.
