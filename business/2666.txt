Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has said the government could remove a portion of Air India's ₹50,000 crore debt to help lure investors for stake sale. "Its books are bad, you can’t leave it like that," he said. Air India's non-aviation related assets such as real estate could also be spun off into a separate company, he added.
