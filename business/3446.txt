US cable operator Charter Communications said it's not interested in acquiring SoftBank-led wireless carrier Sprint. Following this, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is reportedly planning to make a direct offer for Charter, which has a market capitalisation of $101 billion. A merger between the two would create a telecom powerhouse, providing a one-stop shop to buyers for internet and mobile services.
