RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that the economy is showing signs of picking up. "Hopefully, if the monsoon does not deteriorate and in fact improves, sowing has been very good, you may see rural demand coming back more strongly," he added. Earlier, rating agency Moody's had lowered India's growth forecast to 7% from 7.5% due to lower-than-expected rainfall.
