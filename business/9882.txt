South Africaâ€™s Gupta family, accused of holding undue political sway over President Jacob Zuma, said on Saturday it will dispose of its South African holdings. This comes after the country's deputy finance minister alleged that he was offered the finance minister post by the family. Notably, the family holds businesses in various sectors ranging from media to mining.
