In a boost to PM Modi's Make in India initiative, the Ministry of Defense has decided to acquire 50,000 bulletproof jackets from two Indian firmsâ€“ Tata Advanced Materials and MKU. However, the final deal for faster procurement is expected to be signed soon. The government had earlier withdrawn an order of 1.86 lakh bulletproof jackets over issues with specifications.
