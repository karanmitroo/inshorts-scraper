Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio experienced a data breach after a website magicapk.com went live last night with information of Jio customers. Reports alleged that “several sensitive details” were leaked, including customer names, mobile numbers, email IDs, SIM activation dates and even Aadhaar numbers, that were redacted. Jio has denied any such violation of privacy of individuals.
