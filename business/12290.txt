RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Saturday said that it is “hard to pin the slowdown” in India’s exports to the rupee-dollar exchange rate. Rajan asserted that “the slowdown is similar to what has been happening elsewhere", attributing a "significant portion" of it to a "fall in commodity prices". India’s exports fell for the 14th straight month in January.
