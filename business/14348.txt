An agreement was reached among 12 countries including United States and Japan on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact that was in the making for five years. The trade deal would be the largest that the US has negotiated since the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994. The pact allows duty-free trade on most goods and decreased tariffs on others.
