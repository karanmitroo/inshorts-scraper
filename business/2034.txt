A California judge threw out a $417 million award to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer by using Johnson & Johnson (J&J) talc-based baby powder. The judge granted a retrial saying there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial. The verdict had marked the largest sum awarded in a series of talcum powder verdicts against J&J.
