The Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) on Thursday said the rate for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) should not be more than 18%, or else it will cause a rise in inflation. The ICSI further said the GST will throw a lot of opportunities for Company Secretaries as they will be eligible to appear before GST authorities.
