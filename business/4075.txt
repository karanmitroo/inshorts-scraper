India's industrial production grew at 3.6% in May compared with 2.8% in April, government data released on Friday stated. The growth in the eight core infrastructure sectors, which constitute 40.27% of the total industrial production, was attributed to a sharp rise in output of natural gas and electricity. Notably, only two infrastructure sectors showed a decline in output.
