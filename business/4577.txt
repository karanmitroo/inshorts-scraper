Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considering a proposal to privatise state-run Air India, which is over ₹51,000 crore in debt, according to sources. The proposal, which may require the buyer to absorb loans worth nearly ₹20,000 crore linked to aircraft purchases, follows recommendations by a government panel. In 2016, Air India was profitable for the first time in a decade.
