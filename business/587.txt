Australia's Brisbane Airport has announced that it will become the world's first airport to let travellers pay with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum at its terminal shopping areas. An official said, "Many people around the world have made money investing in cryptocurrencies and a lot of these people travel internationally, so it makes sense to offer a digital currency experience."
