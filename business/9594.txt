Oil firm Cairn India shareholders on Monday approved the merger with its parent company Vedanta Resources. Earlier, ₹77,952 crore debt-laden Vedanta had renewed the merger deal in July by offering three additional preference shares to 'cash-rich' Cairn India. The merger, which was approved by 92.86% Cairn shareholders in value, has created India’s largest diversified natural resources company.
