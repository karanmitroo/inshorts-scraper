The rupee plummeted against the dollar Monday, falling by 65 paise to close at nearly 11-month low of 62.94. The Indian unit came under pressure amid dollar demand from importers, and as the greenback firmed up ahead of the U.S. Fed’s meeting starting Tuesday. The rupee’s 65 paise drop in the trade was the biggest fall in last four months.
