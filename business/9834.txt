Tata Power and Javelin Joint Venture team, a Raytheon-Lockheed Martin partnership, have joined hands to co-develop and produce the Javelin anti-armour missile system. As per reports, Indian army would need nearly 40,000 of these missiles to fully equip its 382 infantry battalions and 44 mechanised infantry units. Notably, India had rejected the US' offer to buy Javelin missiles in 2014.
