Billionaire investor Warren Buffett in his annual letter to shareholders said he would rather "prep for a colonoscopy" than issue his firm Berkshire Hathaway's shares. The statement was made in reference to overpaying for past deals with Berkshire stock that caused shareholders to "give more than they received". Buffett also admitted to buying a company that lost all its value.
