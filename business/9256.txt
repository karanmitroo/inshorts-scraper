Two Malaysian organisations have launched a new logo for products made purely by Muslims, apart from the official halal logo for the products manufactured in the country, reports said. The new logo, which will be used starting next year, will be rolled out to help Muslim entrepreneurs in local and foreign halal markets, an official said.
