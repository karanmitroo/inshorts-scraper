The demonetisation exercise is a major assault on the poor and will not change the structural roots of corruption in the country, Indian economist Pranab Bardhan has said. "Unless other measures are taken, I don't expect the long-term effect on corruption to be significant," he stated. Further, people who have gained from demonetisation are the corrupt bank officials, he added.
