Japan's government has released a list of more than 300 companies that have breached labour laws, in order to crack down on firms that are making employees overwork. The name-and-shame tactic aims to eliminate abuses and prevent "karoshi" or death by overwork. Major companies such as advertising agency Dentsu and electronics maker Panasonic have been named for illegal overtime.
