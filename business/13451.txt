The BSE has partnered with India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) to establish India's first physical gold trading exchange. The exchange would enable banks, jewellers and other entities to trade physical gold over a regulated platform. The bullion association and the BSE are set to seek approval from SEBI. Currently, the commodity markets in India offer only gold futures contracts.
