The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday said that it will shortly issue new ₹500 denomination banknotes in the new Mahatma Gandhi Series without any inset letter. The notes will bear current RBI Governor Urjit Patel's signature and the year of printing '2016' printed on the back. All ₹500 notes issued post demonetisation will continue to be legal tender.
