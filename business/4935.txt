Finnish brewery Nokian Panimo has made a party pack of beer, which contains 1,080 cans of Keisari. The pack is made by combining five stacks of beer, each 12 beers wide by 18 beers long. The pack, priced at $2,347 (over ₹1.5 lakh), was reportedly a “joke” in response to rival Karjala's 100-pack of beer.
