Information technology giant Cognizant Technology Solutions is likely to lay off at least 6,000 employees, according to reports. The company is expected to cut down its employee count by as much as 2.3% in order to remove workforce for their non-performance. The move comes at a time when automation is making several jobs redundant in the Indian IT sector.
