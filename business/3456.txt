The National Spot Exchange (NSEL) has urged markets regulator SEBI to resolve the â‚¹5,600 crore payment crisis in the larger interest of investors. The payment crisis broke out in 2013 when NSEL defaulted payments to its investors. NSEL was incorporated with Financial Technologies (India), or FTIL, holding 99.98%, with an objective of operating a pan-India commodities spot exchange platform.
