Airports Authority of India (AAI) has hiked the penalty amount for individuals violating regulations at airports. Any person contravening the regulations would now face up to ₹5,000 penalty, compared to the earlier quantum of ₹500. AAI Chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra said the penalties have been increased as the earlier quantum was not appropriate with the changing times.
