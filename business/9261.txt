Air India has been directed by the apex consumer commission to pay ₹1 lakh compensation to a complainant, who alleged that she was served stale food on a Mumbai-New York flight. The airline said the judgement is not justified as it is "highly disproportionate to the alleged deficiency in service". Notably, Air India fined the caterer ₹20,000 in this regard.
