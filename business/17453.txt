The widely-anticipated acquisition of online store Myntra by Flipkart is likely to close by May end, sources said. The deal, which was expected to materialise in April, was delayed as stakeholders had to go back to the drawing board several times to reach a consensus on Myntraâ€™s autonomy. Post acquisition, Flipkart is likely to go for an IPO in Singapore.
