Virgin Group Founder Richard Branson has said that he started Virgin Group with £200 (₹19,625) and now has 90,000 people working for his company. He said that one can start a business with nothing. He added that there's a thin dividing line between success and failure, and trying to stay on right side of that dividing line is not easy.
