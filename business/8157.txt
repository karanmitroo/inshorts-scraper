The Indian government had demonetised the ₹1,000, ₹5,000 and ₹10,000 currency notes in 1978 in a bid to counter black money in the economy. The move was part of the High Denomination Bank Note (Demonetisation) Act, 1978, which termed the demonetisation decision as a one in "public interest". The ₹1000 note was reintroduced in 2000.
