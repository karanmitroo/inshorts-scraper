Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo has said that his country is ready to "counteract" with a "mirror action" any US trade policy that punishes Mexico's imports to the North American markets or encourages US exports in Mexico. This comes after US President Donald Trump said that companies would face a "major border tax" if they shifted jobs outside US.
