The rupee weakened past the 68 mark against the dollar and dropped to a nine-month low to close at 68.14 on Friday. This comes amid rising possibility of an interest rate hike by the US Fed which triggered outflows from Indian assets. The currency also ended the week with a 1.3% loss, the biggest since January.
