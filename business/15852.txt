Global giant HSBC on Monday reported a 15% decline in its net profit in 2014 while apologizing again over tax-dodging claims at its Swiss division. Earnings after taxation fell to $13.7 billion in 2014, as against $18.7 billion in 2013 when it was also boosted by disposals, the bank said in a statement.
