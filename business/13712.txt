Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday said that the government is targeting the formation of a new auction policy for hydrocarbon blocks by the end of the ongoing fiscal year. Pradhan added that the policy ”is proposed to provide pricing and marketing freedom” for sale of natural gas at market-determined (instead of government-determined) prices.
