Idea Cellular has flagged net neutrality concerns about Reliance Jio’s proposed 4G phone, saying it will only allow the apps of the operator’s choice. The telecom operator further said that it will also launch a slightly expensive handset as a counter to the JioPhone. Notably, the JioPhone has been unveiled at effectively ₹0 with one-time refundable security deposit of ₹1,500.
