Reacting to Baba Ramdev's plan of launching 'desi jeans', a user tweeted, "These jeans, I think, will be made from leaf and tree skins. LOL!!!" Another user wrote, "#Patanjali Jeans or Patanjali Gin. Later makes the more sense if its #herbal." Meanwhile, a user tweeted, " #BabaRamdev launches all new sanskari #patanjalijeans  that will discourage men from raping women!"
