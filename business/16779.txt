Yahoo is planning to invest a part of the proceeds from the Alibaba in messaging app Snapchat, said a report. Yahoo has been in talks to take part in a funding round that would value Snapchat at $10 billion, but its investment is not clear yet, the report added. Snapchat lets users send messages that disappear after a few seconds.
