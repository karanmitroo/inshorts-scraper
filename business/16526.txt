The RBI, in a set of guidelines to banks, has asked them to inform customers about the fall in their balance well in advance. It also said that penal charges levied for not keeping a minimum balance should be directly proportionate to the extent of shortfall. The new guidelines with respect to penal charges will come into effect from April-1.
