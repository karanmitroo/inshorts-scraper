Dubai-based airline Emirates has received its first Rolls-Royce powered Airbus A380 superjumbo after resolving a dispute with the British engine maker over a technical issue. Rolls-Royce is to supply engines for 50 double-deck Emirates A380 jets in a $9.2 billion deal, which was announced in April 2015. Emirates is the biggest A380 operator, having ordered 142 of the superjumbo jets.
