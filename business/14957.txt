South Korean Steelmaker POSCO has announced the possibility of scrapping a $12 billion steel project in Odisha, that was agreed upon a decade ago. A new mining law, enacted in March, makes it mandatory for the company to buy a mining license in an auction. The 12 million-tonnes-a-year initiative was in 2005 billed as Indiaâ€™s biggest foreign direct investment.
