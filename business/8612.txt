The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has recommended a ₹3,050 crore fine against India's top three telcos Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea, for deliberately blocking calls from Reliance Jio's network. The operators were “in non-compliance of the terms and conditions of licence," TRAI said, adding that denial of interconnection to Jio was to "stifle competition" and was "anti-consumer".
