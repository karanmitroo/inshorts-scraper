US-based lender Wells Fargo has asked a US court to order dozens of customers, who are suing it for opening unauthorised accounts, to resolve their disputes in private arbitrations instead of court. The motion is in response to a first-class action lawsuit filed against the bank. Notably, Wells Fargo was fined $190 million for opening 2 million fake accounts.
