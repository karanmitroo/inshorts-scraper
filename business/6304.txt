Coca-Cola tested a vending machine that automatically raised prices for its drinks during hot weather in 1999. The machine would also provide drinks at discounted rates when the business was slow and during off-peak hours. The vending machines, developed using temperature sensors and computer chips, were withdrawn after customer backlash.
