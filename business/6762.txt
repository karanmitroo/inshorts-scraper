Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has bought a stake in French luxury goods retailer Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy. This will allow it to put pressure on the company to stop selling high-end leather goods and clothes made with exotic animal skins. LVMH, world's biggest luxury group, owns brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.
