Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has asserted there are no plans to privatise Air India and the Ministry's goal is to ensure its survival. "Nothing can be ruled out, want Air India to survive...don't want it to become history," Raju stated. He further said that Air India's finances are very bad and the company's impoverished part has to go.
