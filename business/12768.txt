Steel making company Tata Steel on Thursday reported a net loss of ₹2,127 crore for the quarter ended December compared to a profit of ₹157 crore in the year-ago period. Net sales fell by 16% to ₹28,039 crore. The slump in revenue was attributed to the company's cheaper imports to Europe and sluggish demand.
