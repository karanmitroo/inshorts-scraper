India's onion exports during April-February in 2015-16 rose 33% year-on-year to â‚¹2,362 crore, according to National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation. Volume-wise, the exports rose 10% to 9.8 lakh tonnes. The rise in export value comes after the government hiked the minimum export price of onion last year, as prices increased substantially on lower output due to unseasonal rains.
