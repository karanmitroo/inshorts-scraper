Private sector lender ICICI Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Chanda Kochhar has said that the bank has received deposits of around ₹32,000 crore since the demonetisation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. Kochhar said there is a "lot of currency" in the country but the logistics are taking time due to which bank branches and ATMs are struggling.
