Oil companies on Thursday cut price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) by Rs 43.50 per cylinder. A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised (or market-priced) LPG will now be available at Rs 708.50, down from Rs 752 previously, in Delhi. The 5th straight reduction in rates of non-subsidised LPG since August, comes due to fall in international oil prices.
