The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has sought the revocation of beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya's passport in connection with the money laundering case against him. This comes after Mallya failed to present himself before it for the third time on April 9. Earlier, the Supreme Court had directed him to disclose all assets owned by him and his family by April 21.
