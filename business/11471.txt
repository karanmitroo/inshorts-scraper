The drought faced by ten Indian states will roughly cost the economy at least ₹6,50,000 crore, said a report by trade association Assocham. The report claimed the drought's impact was likely to remain for at least six months. It reached the figure by assuming the government would spend ₹3,000 per person for one or two months, on 33 crore people.
