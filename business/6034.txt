The government has no plans to introduce ₹1,000 notes, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das confirmed on Wednesday. "Focus is on production and supply of ₹500 and lower denomination notes," he added. Several reports had earlier suggested that the government is planning to launch a new series of ₹1,000 notes to replace the earlier demonetised note of similar denomination.
