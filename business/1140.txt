BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has alleged that Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) was pressured by the PM Narendra Modi-led government to show data indicating that demonetisation had no adverse impact on the economy. He said the quarterly GDP data shouldn't be relied upon as it is "bogus". Moody's and Fitch will publish any data if you "pay them", Swamy alleged.
