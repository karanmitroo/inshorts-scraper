Idea Cellular on Tuesday dismissed reports claiming that it is in merger talks with Vodafone India as "absolutely untrue and preposterous". Earlier, media reports suggested that Idea is "exploring"  options for a strategic deal with Vodafone. Notably, government data shows that Airtel leads the market with a 24.39% wireless subscriber share, and is followed by Vodafone (19.14%) and Idea (16.89%).
