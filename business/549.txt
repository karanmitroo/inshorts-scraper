Economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg on Friday denied that the Union Budget presented a day earlier was the reason for benchmark index Sensex's crash of over 800 points. He added that there could be "some anxiety" that triggered the crash. He said the reasons for Sensex's biggest crash since November 2016 needed to be figured out.
