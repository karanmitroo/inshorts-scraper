A Land Court in Queensland, Australia on Tuesday rejected a bid to stop the construction of a $15.4 billion coal mine (potentially Australia's largest) and rail project by infrastructure giant Adani Group. The court, however, gave Adani a list of recommendations. An environmentalist group had opposed the mine's construction for its expected impact on climate change, groundwater, and biodiversity.
