India's headline inflation (Wholesale Price Index) rose to a five month high - 5.79% in July from 4.86% in June - pushed up by a steady increase in fuel prices because of the weaker currency and double-digit rise in food prices. Even the core inflation (non-food manufactured inflation) rose to 2.4% against an easing of 2% in June.
