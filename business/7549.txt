PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India on Thursday launched its Full Circle programme that allows women employees to take leave for up to three years for childcare once during their employment. The programme applies to all regular full-time women employees who have been working with the firm for over 2 years, and intend to return to PwC after the break.
