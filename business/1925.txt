France's Dassault Aviation said it would invest €100 million (over ₹750 crore) in its defence sector joint venture with the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group to manufacture aircraft components. Reliance Aerostructure will hold a majority 51% stake in the joint venture, with Dassault holding the rest. Dassault's investment was the largest FDI in the Indian defence sector, Anil Ambani said earlier.
