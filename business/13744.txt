The Income Tax department is reportedly investigating around 2,627 people who are part of the board of directors of more than 20 companies and are flagged as violators of Companies Act 2013. On the recommendation of Special Investigation Team, the department is probing into the genuineness of these companies and checking whether these are paper companies channeling for black money.
