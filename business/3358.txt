SK Patra, former CEO of Patanjali Ayurved, in an interview said that the company does not care very much about profits, adding, "Babaji only wants to sell." Patra further noted that Baba Ramdev largely drives the company and is involved in all the most important decisions. "He personally tries out every single product and approves it," Patra added.
