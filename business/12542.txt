Car maker Maruti Suzuki today temporarily suspended production at its Manesar and Gurgaon plants in Haryana citing disruption of supply of components due to the ongoing Jat agitation. The company said it was considering "alternative routes and sources" to procure the supplies. The Jat community has been organising a violent protest in Haryana demanding reservation in the OBC category.
