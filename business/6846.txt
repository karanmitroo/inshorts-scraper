US daily The New York Times, in an editorial, has said the BJP-led Centre's demonetisation drive was "atrociously planned and executed", and shows "little evidence" that it succeeded in combating corruption and black money. Adding that the Indian economy is suffering, the daily said manufacturing and real estate sectors are down, and people have been facing a cash crunch.
