Market regulator Sebi has made it mandatory for commodity traders and brokers to put a software testing in place for trading systems for preventing possible manipulation. The move comes after Sebi merged with commodities markets regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) in September to make a single market watchdog. These guidelines are already applicable for stock exchanges.
