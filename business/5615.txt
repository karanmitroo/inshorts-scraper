Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said that the government is trying to implement the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 this year. "The GST will make the goods and services cheaper and make tax evasion difficult," he added.  The GST will transform the complex indirect tax system into a simple system, he further said.
