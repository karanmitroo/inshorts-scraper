Goldman Sachs has cut India's GDP growth rate forecast to 4% from 6% earlier for current financial year, reflecting more difficult external funding conditions. It revised its six- and 12-month forecasts on rupee to 72, and 70, respectively, against dollar. Goldman's report comes after JPMorgan, HSBC Global Research, Nomura and ICRA  cut their growth forecast on India to below 5%.
