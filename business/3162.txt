Biscuit manufacturer Parle-Gluco wished its consumers prosperity in ‘this new year of freedom’ in an advertisement in 1947. The advertisement for Indian Military Academy in Dehradun invited applications from 'British subject of Indian domicile or descent', which was changed after India attained freedom. Reynolds in its advertisement claimed that its ball pen could go for 15 years without a refill.
