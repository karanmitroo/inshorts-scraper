Snapping a two-day losing streak, gold prices Saturday rose Rs 135 higher to Rs 27,160 per ten gram in the national capital. Prices of the yellow metal were buoyed by a fresh spell of buying by jewellers and retailers, and a firming global trend. Silver, however, fell by Rs 365 to Rs 36,235 per kg on reduced offtake.
