The Advertising Standards Council of India has sent a notice to Airtel to withdraw its 4G advertisement, following a consumer's complaint. “The claim in the ad, ‘Airtel 4G is the fastest network ever’ and ‘If your network is faster, we will pay your mobile bills for life’, is misleading by omission in the absence of appropriate disclaimers,” the notice said.
