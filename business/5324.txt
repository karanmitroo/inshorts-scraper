Consumer goods giant Hindustan Unilever plans to cut jobs as its parent Unilever, the maker of Dove soap, attempts to reduce costs globally. The firm may cut 10-15% of its workforce, including layoffs and reduction in new hiring, according to reports. Notably, HUL employs 18,000 people across factories and offices in the country, according to its 2015-16 annual report.
