The Bombay High Court has asked Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved to stop airing its toilet soap advertisement. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) obtained an ad-interim injunction against Patanjali‘s advertisement, which allegedly disparaged its soap brands like Lux, Pears, Lifebuoy, and Dove. In its ad, Patanjali indirectly tells consumers to reject “chemical-based soaps” and adopt natural ones.
