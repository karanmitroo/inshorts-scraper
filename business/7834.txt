Mahatma Gandhi first featured on Indian currency notes in 1969 when a design series in honour of the 100th birth celebrations of the leader was issued. Till 1996, only certain notes had a portrait of Gandhi and since 1996, the RBI started to print banknotes with the portrait of Gandhi on all currency notes from ₹5 to ₹1000.
