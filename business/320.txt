US' Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ordered a New York City resident to shut down his Bitcoin mining rig after it interfered with T-Mobile's wireless network. The order was issued after the regulator started receiving complaints from the telecom operator. FCC said the resident could face fines and seizure of the device if he keeps operating the Bitcoin miner.
