Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha on Friday informed the Parliament that commercial banks’ total non-performing assets (NPAs) stand at ₹3.47 lakh crore. Of these, there are 7,265 wilful defaulters (those owing over ₹25 lakh) accounting for ₹64,335 crore, nearly one-fifth of the total NPAs. Sinha added that 115 such cases with “clear evidence of connivance” are being investigated.
