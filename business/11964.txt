Reliance Communications will upgrade all its CDMA customers to 4G network starting May 4 “using the liberalised 800MHz spectrum”. It has paid ₹5,383.84 crore to the DoT for liberalising the said spectrum in 16 circles including Delhi, Gujarat, Mumbai, Bihar and Kolkata. A liberalised spectrum allows telecom operators to use any technology to deliver mobile services like 3G and 4G.
