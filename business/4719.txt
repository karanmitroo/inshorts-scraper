Confectionery multinational Nestl√© has lost its bid against Cadbury to register the shape of the four-finger KitKat chocolate as a trademark, marking its fourth unsuccessful attempt to do so. The court ruled the four-finger design had "no inherent distinctiveness" and the shape was not a "badge or origin". This will let competitors produce their own KitKat copies without legal consequences.
