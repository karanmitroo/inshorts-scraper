Zopper, a hyper-local mobile marketplace, has recently raised $20 million in series-B funding from Tiger Global and Nirvana Ventures Advisors. The funding will be used for increasing the brand presence across 30 cities of the country, making key appointments and leveraging technology to accelerate the growth of the company. Zopper had secured series-A funding in June last year.
