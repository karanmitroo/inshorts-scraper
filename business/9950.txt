Online media outlet BuzzFeed will split into two separate divisions, BuzzFeed News and BuzzFeed Entertainment, CEO Jonah Peretti reportedly said on Tuesday. The health and video team will be integrated into BuzzFeed News while the social-media team will come under BuzzFeed Entertainment. This comes amid reports that BuzzFeed missed revenue targets this year and cut its annual projection to half.
