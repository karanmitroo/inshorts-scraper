Telecom regulator TRAI on Friday said it will look into the proposed merger between telecom majors Vodafone and Idea "as and when" regulatory issues crop up. "As and when there is regulatory issue I will certainly give advise to the government," TRAI Chairman RS Sharma said. Notably, the proposed merger comes amid competition from new entrant Reliance Jio.
