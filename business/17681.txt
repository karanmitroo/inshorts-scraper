India's retail inflation eased to a 25-month low of 8.10% in February from 8.79% in the previous month, as fresh seasonal arrivals pushed down vegetable prices. Moreover, the core retail inflation also edged down below 8% for the first time in seven months. Remarkably, the RBI has raised lending rate three times in the last six months to tame inflation.
