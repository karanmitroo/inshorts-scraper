A gambler lost £70,000 (over ₹57 lakh) as he believed that the UK election was "unlosable" for PM Theresa May. British bookmaker William Hill, which took the wager from an unnamed gambler, said around £20 million (₹164 crore) was wagered, the majority of it backing May. Notably, May lost her parliamentary majority after calling an early election to strengthen it.
