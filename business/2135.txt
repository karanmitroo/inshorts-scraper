Kobe Steel components used in Japan’s bullet trains failed industry standards, officials said on Thursday. Two companies operating the high-speed Shinkansen trains said they found Kobe Steel parts fell short in quality tests, though they don’t pose any safety concerns. Earlier this week, Kobe steel said that products used by about 200 companies were certified with falsified data.
