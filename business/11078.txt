The proposed airport at Mopa in Goa will have a separate Naval enclave for which five acres of land will be earmarked, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said. The proposed structure will be built by the Defence Ministry with separate entry and exit to the facility, he added. The first phase of the airport is expected to be commissioned in 2019.
