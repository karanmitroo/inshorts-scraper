World's fourth richest person Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway held nearly $100 billion (₹6.38 lakh crore) in cash after June quarter. Addressing the rising cash pile, Buffett had earlier said it was because he hadn’t put his "foot to the floor" on an acquisition. Buffett further noted he shouldn’t keep so much money earning next to nothing for long periods.
