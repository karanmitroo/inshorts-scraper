Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that saying no sometimes as the RBI Governor may be a "career ending decision". Adding that he said no when he had to, he said regulators must not sabotage a policy they disagree with but instead quit. He also clarified that he left RBI as there was no agreement on terms of continuing.
