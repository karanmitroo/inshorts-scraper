HDFC Bank is reportedly planning to launch a mobile recharge service in next two-three months, that will let users recharge their mobiles by giving a 'missed call' to the bank. Users would need to register their mobile numbers with the bank and set a favourite recharge option. The service will initially be offered to only HDFC Bank customers.
