Petrol pump dealers have called off their October 13 strike, which would have shut down nearly 54,000 petrol pumps across the country. The dealers had announced the strike claiming that their demands, including scrapping unfair penalties and implementing dealer margins, were not met. However, government-owned oil marketing companies said that almost all their demands were already fulfilled.
