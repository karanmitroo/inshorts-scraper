Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Thursday said that the company will not withdraw an arbitration it has initiated against the government for disallowing recovery of certain KG-D6 gas field costs. This comes after the government disallowed recovery of $2.756 billion incurred by RIL and partners, for missing gas production target for five fiscal years starting from April 1, 2010.
