Construction firm Mears has banned its workers from having beards, citing health and safety reasons. Mears said workers needed to be clean-shaven in order to be safely fitted with a tight-fitting face mask when working in dusty environments. Exceptions will be made if a worker canâ€™t shave or a mask cannot be worn for medical or religious reasons, it stated.
