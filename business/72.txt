Some of the funds stolen from Japanese exchange Coincheck in the biggest-ever cryptocurrency hack have been traced to a Canadian exchange, according to research firm BIG Blockchain Intelligence Group. The stolen tokens are being converted into other cryptocurrencies and then possibly sent back to Japan, it said. More than $530-million worth NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck in January.
