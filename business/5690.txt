Power Minister Piyush Goyal, while suggesting the government has no plan to sell state-run Air India, said none of the private airlines would agree to operate Haj flights to take muslim pilgrims to Mecca. He further compared Haj flights by Air India as an example of 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas'. Goyal added that every big country needs a national carrier.
