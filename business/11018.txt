The government plans to make purity stamping, or hallmarking, mandatory for all jewellery shops in India to protect consumers from getting duped on the quality of gold, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. Once made mandatory, jewellers will be made accountable and jewellery shops will have to sell hallmarked certified gold jewellery, he added.
