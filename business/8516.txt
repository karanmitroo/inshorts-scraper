Tata Sons has dissolved the Group Executive Council (GEC) formed by recently-ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry, which he formed after taking over the role in December 2012. After Mistry's removal was made public on Monday, GEC members' details were removed from the company's website. GEC was a team of Mistry's handpicked advisers that would remain for 20 years with the company.
