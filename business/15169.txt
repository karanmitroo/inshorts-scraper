Apple reportedly lost a lawsuit in Taiwan on Wednesday wherein it was accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices, and was fined $647,124. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission had previously levied a fine on the company for setting contract prices for its iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and 5S models without seeking its Taiwan telecom partners' approval. Apple counter-sued the commission and lost.
