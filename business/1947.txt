Shares of a British company, On-line, surged about 400% on Friday after it announced plans to change its name to 'On-line Blockchain'. It is the biggest one-day gain for the company since its December 1996 listing in London. "Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are a new and exciting area we have been working on for some time," the company said.
