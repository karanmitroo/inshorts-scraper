An initial probe has found there was no leak or theft of Reliance Jioâ€™s customer data, Navi Mumbai Deputy Commissioner Tushar Doshi said. He said the detained man may have obtained information using a Jio retailer's username and password. Doshi further said the website 'magicapk' required one to type a mobile number to get subscriber details, limiting the leaked data.
