The government is set to sign a new tax treaty with Cyprus, a prominent low-tax jurisdiction, aimed at preventing investors from defaulting on paying taxes in India. The Double Taxation Avoidance agreement will allow the government to prevent treaty abuse, tax evasion, and round-tripping of funds. It will also remove Cyprus from the government's blacklist for not providing information.
