Hitachi Metals and a subsidiary have filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission claiming Chinese manufacturers and ex-Hitachi Metals employees stole trade secrets of its manufacturing technologies for amorphous metals. The theft could destroy or injure the US industry, the firms claimed. The firms added they had to reduce production capacity and headcount to cope with the theft.
