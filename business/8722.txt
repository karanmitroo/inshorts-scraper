The Centre has made it mandatory for automakers to furnish detailed declaration about the emission and noise levels for each vehicle from April 2017. Information like levels of pollutants and sound level for horn needs to be provided. These rules will apply to all vehicles which run on petrol, CNG, LPG, and diesel, as well as electric and hybrid vehicles.
