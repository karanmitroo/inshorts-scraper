Indian e-commerce startup Flipkart has handed out employee stock option plans (ESOPs) to over a third of its workforce, the company's Chief Administrative Officer Nitin Seth said. Seth added that it was a "very, very significant increase from previous years". Earlier, Flipkart had modified its variable pay structure for middle and senior managers to give less cash and more ESOPs.
