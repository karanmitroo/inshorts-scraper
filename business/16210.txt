Indian economy may grow at 6.4% in 2015 and even faster in 2016 due to government's reforms agenda, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said Sunday. “We project that India will be a bright spot in an otherwise medium global economic outlook,” he said. Indian economy grew by 5.7% and 5.3% in the second and third quarter of 2014, respectively.
