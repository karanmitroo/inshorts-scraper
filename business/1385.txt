Dutch newspaper Rotterdam Daily AD has published an article calling on people to sell their Bitcoins as they undermine the government and reduce the power of central banks. The article claimed that many Bitcoin transactions are about money laundering and tax avoidance. It also reported that another drawback is that Bitcoin does not benefit the government, unlike fiat money.
