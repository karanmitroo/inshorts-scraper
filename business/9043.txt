A government study has found different toxins in PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottles of five cold drink brands produced by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. The study discovered heavy metals antimony, lead, chromium and cadmium and the compound DEHP or Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew, Sprite and 7Up. The companies either denied receiving test reports or declined to respond.
