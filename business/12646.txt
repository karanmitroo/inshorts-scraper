The government in the next two to three months is going to introduce Business Identification Number (BIN) for companies. Once introduced, the BIN will help in reducing the time of registration processes of the companies by acting as an identification number for different regulatory purposes. The companies will have to apply for the BIN on the government's e-Biz portal.
