India's largest private sector bank, HDFC, has decided to discontinue issuing slips after cash withdrawals at ATMs and will alert the customer through SMSes. The bank is set to roll out the feature across its 11,700 ATMs by June-end. An official said the switch to paperless mode will help it save under Rs 10 crore a year spent on paper.
