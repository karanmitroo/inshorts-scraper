The pay of US-based firm Ultimate Software's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Scott Scherr tripled in 2015 to $38.3 million, an amount which was more than the company's earnings for the period. Notably, Scherr's package was higher than the compensation of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Scherr, who became CEO in 1996, led a 1000% growth in Ultimate's share price since 2008.
