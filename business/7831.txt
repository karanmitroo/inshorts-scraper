Insurer American International Group has said it expects to book a loss of about $430 million on the previously disclosed deal to sell Fuji Life Insurance in Japan. That loss will be partly cushioned by a gain of $300 million on the deal completed this week to sell the International Finance Centre Seoul in Korea, the New York-based company added.
