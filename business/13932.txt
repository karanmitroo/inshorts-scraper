According to a report by Crisil, the Regional Connectivity Scheme, proposed in the draft aviation policy would hurt the finances of airlines, as it proposes an upper cap on fare for regional routes (â‚¹2,500 per hour). The 2% levy on tickets for regional connectivity fund could marginally increase prices, despite which the prices could fall in FY17, Crisil said.
