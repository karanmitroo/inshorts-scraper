Coca-Cola and PepsiCo said on Monday they are working to remove a controversial ingredient called brominated vegetable oil, from all their drinks, including Mountain Dew, Fanta and Powerade. The ingredient has been the target of certain petitions, which say that the component has been patented as a flame retardant and isn't approved for use in Japan and the European Union.
