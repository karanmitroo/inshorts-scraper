A legal agency, ARCK Consultants, appointed by the State Bank of India took possession of liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher Villa on Candolim beach village in north Goa on Friday. The villa, valued at ₹90 crore, was sealed after an inventory of goods inside its premises were drawn up, and nobody is allowed to access it without the agency's permission.
