Narendra Modi has become the second Prime Minister to demonetise high-value rupee notes in independent India. Modi, however, is the first Prime Minister to introduce a ₹2,000 currency note. Earlier in 1978, the then PM Morarji Desai had demonetised all currency notes above ₹100 in order to curb black money. At that time, ₹1,000, ₹5,000, ₹10,000 notes were in circulation.
