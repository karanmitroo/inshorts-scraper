Canada has recalled a batch of vodka bottles that weren't diluted properly, and read 40% on the label when they actually had 81% alcohol content. The batch is "not safe for consumption" and "consuming a product with an alcohol content of 80% could cause serious illness", authorities said. It was discovered that 654 bottles that were shipped, weren't diluted properly.
