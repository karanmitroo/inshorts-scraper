A Chinese company has cloned the Washington Post website in the Chinese language, carrying articles on foreign policy and other topics from China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The website was operated by Sun News, a Chinese client of The Washington Post News Service, according to reports. The Chinese website later removed the US newspapers' masthead and adopted a new layout.
