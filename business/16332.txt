After a long gap of 20 years, the government is keen on bringing back one-rupee paper notes. The 'Printing of One Rupee Currency Notes Rules, 2015â€™, will come into effect from January 2015. The new one-rupee note will be predominantly pink and green in color, and have "Bharat Sarkar" on its masthead, instead of Reserve Bank of India.
