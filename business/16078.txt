As part of its "workforce rebalancing" agenda, IBM has decided to fire several thousands of its employees. "We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year. It will be a lower amount", Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said. IBM, however, dismissed a Forbes magazine report that claimed around 112,000 employees could be fired.
