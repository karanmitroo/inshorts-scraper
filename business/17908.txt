RBI Deputy Governor KC Chakrabarty termed the Indian Banks' Association's proposal to charge customers for ATM withdrawals as 'ridiculous' and 'illogical'. However, Chakrabarty conceded that non-viable costs may leave banks with no other choice but to raise charges. Banks cited increased costs such as that of physical security behind the proposal; RBI has not yet received any formal intimation.
