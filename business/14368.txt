Amazon on Thursday told its third-party sellers that it will stop selling media-streaming devices Google Chromecast and Apple TV as they do not "interact well" with Amazon Prime Video. Sellers can continue to offer other video-streaming devices such as Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Amazon's own Fire TV devices. Amazon’s shares traded $6.20 higher at $518.09 following the announcement.
