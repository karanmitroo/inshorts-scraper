The Securities and Exchange Board of India on Thursday fined property developer DLF and its top management $8.4 million for their lack of disclosures during the initial public offering (IPO). DLF had previously been banned from raising capital for 3 years after SEBI ruled it had wilfully withheld details of its subsidiaries and legal cases when it filed its IPO.
