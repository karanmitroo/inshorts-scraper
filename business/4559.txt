Reliance Jio has alleged that Airtel is offering incoming calls on prepaid connections in Jammu and Kashmir despite government’s order to suspend services. Jio has demanded “stringent action” against Airtel for violation of government order. However, Airtel denied the charge and responded with counter-allegation that Jio has violated rules in J&K by disguising prepaid connections as postpaid.
