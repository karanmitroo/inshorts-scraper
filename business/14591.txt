Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'startup mission' will be run by the commerce ministry's Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and not the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship. According to government officials, DIPP was chosen as it could help manufacturing-focused startups by tying-up with 'Make in India'. Modi announced 'Start-up India, Stand up India' on August 15.
