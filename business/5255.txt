Bharti Airtel has asked telecom regulator TRAI to intervene after rival Reliance Jio started a new offer for customers that was similar to a previous programme stopped by authorities. Airtel said that it hopes the regulator will act against the offer. Airtel has said Reliance Jio's 'Dhan Dhana Dhan' plan violates the spirit of the regulator's directive.
