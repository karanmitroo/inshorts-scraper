The government on Thursday allowed traders registered with agricultural produce market committees to withdraw ₹50,000 per week from their own bank accounts. This will allow traders to meet cash requirements for payment of wages and other labour costs. Further, the government has also allowed farmers to withdraw up to ₹25,000 per week against the crop loans sanctioned in their names.
