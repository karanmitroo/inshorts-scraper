The RBI in its annual report reiterated the overall gross value added (GVA) growth projection at 7.6% in 2016-17, up from 7.2% last year. This will be on account of a positive agricultural performance and the release of the Seventh Pay Commission's payments, the report stated. Further, short-term macroeconomic priorities will be on achieving the 4% inflation target, it added.
