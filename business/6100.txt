IT firm Tech Mahindra has said it sees the proposed merger of telcos Vodafone and Idea as a "seismic" event that will impact the IT sector, but asserted that it will benefit from such a deal. "It is a big market where these people are merging together...It is not an ordinary change," Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani stated.
