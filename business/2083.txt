The Income Tax Department has launched an 'online chat' service for taxpayers seeking answers to basic queries and doubts relating to direct tax issues. The chat window has been hosted on 'www.incometaxindia.gov.in', the main page of the department's website. Further, an option has also been provided to the taxpayers for emailing entire chats to their ids for future reference.
