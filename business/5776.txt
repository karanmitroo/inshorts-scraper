Local government officials in Hubei province, China were forced to smoke in order to boost the global economy through tax income amidst the financial crisis in 2009. Under the rule, the authorities asked civil servants and teachers to smoke 2,30,000 packs of locally-made cigarettes every year. The order was however cancelled after a local newspaper criticised it.
