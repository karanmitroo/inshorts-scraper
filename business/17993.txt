Due to the removal of inactive mobile telephone connections and high tele-density in urban areas, the number of telephone users in India declined over 3% in 12 months to 90.45 crore in October-end. However, there has been no decline in the revenue received by the government from telecom service providers. The government targets 1,200 million telephone connections by 2017.
