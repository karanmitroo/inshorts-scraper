Ride-hailing app Uber is actually worth $28 billion against its current valuation of $62.5 billion, according to Aswath Damodaran, a professor at NYU's business school. He cited the reasons for this estimate as Uber's hurdles in revenue generation, operational costs upon expansion and entry of larger players. He published a blog detailing calculations and comparisons to arrive at his estimate.
