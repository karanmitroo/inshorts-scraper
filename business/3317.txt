Australia's largest lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia on Monday said a "coding error" was responsible for the 53,700 alleged breaches of money laundering and terrorism financing laws. The bank had been sued by the government on Thursday. The case relates to the bank's cash deposit machines, which allow anonymous deposits to recipient accounts that can then be funnelled offshore.
