Kingfisher Airlines Saturday announced that the Calcutta High Court has put a stay on the decision of United Bank of Indiaâ€™s (UBI) Grievance Redressal Committee, which had earlier declared the airline as a wilful defaulter. This comes as a respite for the airline, which had filed a writ petition in the court against UBI and others.
