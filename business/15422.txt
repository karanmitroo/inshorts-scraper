Zomato has introduced a 'sick selfies' rule for its employees wherein they will have to send a selfie to prove their illness to get a sick leave. The practice began when a woman employee in Lebanon accidentally sent a selfie to her entire team at work, instead of an e-mail explaining that she was sick, a Zomato blogpost revealed.
