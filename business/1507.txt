India's largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical has said its US-based subsidiary is recalling two lots of diabetes drug Riomet due to microbial contamination. The contamination was discovered during sample preparation for a study test, Sun Pharmaceuticals said in a statement. The company said the use of the drug could raise risk of infection, particularly in patients with weaker immune systems.
