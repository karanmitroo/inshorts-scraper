The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has recommended to the RBI imposing a fee for withdrawing money from non-home bank ATMs in urban areas, to help recover increasing costs. However, no fee has been proposed for transactions in semi-urban and rural areas. Currently, there is a cap of five free transactions for use of ATMs run by other banks.
