Diageo is launching a US limited edition of its Johnnie Walker Black Label Scotch featuring a woman called Jane Walker on the label. The icon will appear on 250,000 bottles of whisky and debut in March to coincide with Women's History Month and International Women's Day. For every bottle made, Diageo will donate $1 to organisations supporting women's causes.
