The government has deferred a decision on selling BSNL stake amid the turmoil in the telecom sector triggered by Reliance Jio's entry. "Reliance Jio has hit hard our revenue, particularly in the mobile segment," BSNL Chairman and MD Anupam Shrivastava said. He said the government should wait until the company returns to profit before attempting to sell a stake.
