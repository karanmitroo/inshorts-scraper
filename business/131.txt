Credit rating agency Moody's has kept India's GDP growth estimate unchanged at 7.6% for the calendar year 2018. Moody's said that Indian economy has started to recover from the "negative impact" of demonetisation and disruption related to the rollout of the GST. "The bank recapitalisation plan should also help credit growth over time, thereby supporting growth," the agency added.
