Toyota Motor President Akio Toyoda on Thursday said his company had increased its US production in the past three decades, and that the Japanese brand should also be considered a US manufacturer. Notably, Toyoda's comment comes as global automakers face pressure from US President Donald Trump, who demanded that more cars sold in the US be made locally.
