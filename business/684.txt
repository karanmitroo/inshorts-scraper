A Californian woman Essie Grundy has sued retail giant Walmart for locking African-American beauty products in a glass case, while other products were easily accessible. She alleged that a shop employee told her that it "was a directive from corporate headquarters". She further alleged that she was told that she wasn't allowed to touch the products until she purchased them.
