Aiming to pay back the investors who had traded on NSEL till it went bust in July 2013, the government on Tuesday proposed a merger of the National Spot Exchange (NSEL), with its parent Financial Technologies (FTIL). The ministry of corporate affairs said that the merger could allow "satisfactory settlement of rights and liabilities of stakeholders and creditors of NSEL".
