The government on Friday extended the ban on the import of milk and milk products from China for another year till June 2017. The ban, which was first imposed in 2008, has been extended every year since. The ban was reportedly implemented following apprehensions that milk consignments from China contained melamine, a toxic chemical used in making fertilisers and plastics.
