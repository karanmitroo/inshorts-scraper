Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) decision to retain India's credit rating with stable outlook is a "huge endorsement" of government policies. He said S&P is known to be far more conservative compared with Moody's or Fitch. He said initiatives like GST, bankruptcy code and bank recapitalisation were praised by the agency.
