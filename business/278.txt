Jeweller Nirav Modi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal has said PNB's $1.77-billion fraud case against his client will collapse just like the 2G scam and Bofors scandal. Aggarwal said the probing agencies won't be able to prove the charges. He added that if Nirav wanted to commit a fraud and run away, then like Vijay Mallya, he would have taken everything abroad.
