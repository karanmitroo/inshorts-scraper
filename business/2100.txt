Mercedes-Benz is recalling 4 lakh cars in the UK owing to a fault that may deploy an airbag by mistake, the company said on Monday. The recall is not related to the exploding Takata airbag scandal, it added. Claiming that the fix will take only an hour, Mercedes said the airbag issue only affected certain vehicles in "rare circumstances".
