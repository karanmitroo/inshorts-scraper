In a letter to Chairman Ajay Tyagi, SEBI's employees have opposed the regulator's proposal to hire a chief economist at the level of executive director. The employees said the post of chief economist was redundant, and didn't serve the market regulator's core functions. They added the post was justified for the RBI as its core function is enabling macro-economic stability.
