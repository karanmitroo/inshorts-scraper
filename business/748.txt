Idea Cellular on Wednesday posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss of ₹1,284.5 crore, in its fifth consecutive quarterly loss. Idea's revenue declined by 25% to ₹6,509.6 crore, mainly due to telecom regulator TRAI's decision to reduce interconnection charges by more than half. Notably, Idea's merger with Vodafone India is expected to be completed in first half of this year.
