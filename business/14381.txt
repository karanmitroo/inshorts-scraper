Swedish clothing brand H&M opened its first Indian outlet in Delhi’s Select Citywalk mall on Friday. The company’s Indian operations will function as a single-brand retailer under the Foreign Direct Investment regulations, unlike Zara and Gap, which partnered with Tata and Arvind Ltd respectively. H&M has announced investing about Rs 730 crore in India in the next five years.
