In a bid to promote the recently implemented GST regime, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry has asked all television broadcasters (news and non-news) to run scrolls about GST awareness campaign Manthan. Under the campaign, the government will conduct workshops across the country. Notably, GST was launched on July 1, and is pegged as the biggest tax reform in 70 years.
