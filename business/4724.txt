Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has launched the 'Operation Clean Money' portal that aims "to create a tax-compliant society". The portal will identify those who have made deposits or purchases not in line with the declared income. It will also enable transparent Tax Administration by sharing status reports, including an explanation of verification issues, and thematic analysis reports.
