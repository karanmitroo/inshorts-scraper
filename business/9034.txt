Indian companies should utilise CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) "much more" to increase exports to Japan and bridge the trade deficit, according to Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. She also expressed concerns over the trade deficit which has risen from pre-CEPA levels at $3.1 billion to $5.2 billion. The CEPA was signed between the two nations in 2011.
