After 7-successive hikes since June, the petrol price has been reduced by Rs.3.05/litre, effective Monday midnight. However, diesel price has been hiked by 50-paise/litre. The cut has been made possible because of softening crude-oil prices coupled with the appreciation of Rupee against Dollar. Petrol prices were last cut on May-1 by Rs.3/litre, the highest reduction in rates in over 5-years.
