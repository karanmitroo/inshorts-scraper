The Finance Ministry has reportedly asked public sector banks to look at rationalising their domestic and overseas branches to strengthen their financials. It has asked the banks to discuss consolidation of overseas branches and take a final call on closing some unviable operations. Notably, Bank of Baroda has a presence across 25 countries while SBI has offices across 36 countries.
