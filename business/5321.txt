The Centre has informed the Supreme Court it has taken a "conscious decision" to not extend the period beyond December 30, 2016 for exchanging demonetised notes of ₹1,000 and ₹500. For non-resident Indians the deadline ended on March 31. The government was responding to a court notice asking it to explain why citizens should not be granted one more extension.
