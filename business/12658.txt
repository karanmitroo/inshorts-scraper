The World Gold Council (WGC) on Thursday reported that India’s demand for gold recovered to increase by 2.5% in 2015, after falling in 2014. While investment in gold declined by 6% year-on-year in volume terms, jewellery demand expanded 5.3%. Overall gold demand in value terms, however, fell almost 6% to ₹2.03 lakh crore due to a drop in prices.
