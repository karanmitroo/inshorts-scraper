The Finance Ministry has defended Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das over a Chennai land deal, saying the allocation was made according to the state Cabinet's terms. This comes after a website alleged that Das, during his tenure as a Tamil Nadu Secretary, had allotted lands at "pittance of a price". Earlier, MP Subramanian Swamy had levelled similar allegations on Das.
