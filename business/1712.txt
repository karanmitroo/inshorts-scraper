The CBI on Wednesday said it had arrested 21 public servants and 26 private citizens for illegally exchanging the scrapped ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes. The CBI has also found deposits of ₹396 crore in 84 cases registered by it relating to illicit currency exchange post demonetisation. CBI Director Alok Verma said demonetisation "aided" the CBI in its anti-corruption drive.
