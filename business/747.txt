US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has rejected further funding from venture capitalists who offered to make new investments, according to reports. This comes after Coinbase reportedly made $1 billion revenue in 2017, going past its projection of $600 million. Further, Coinbase has also warned its shareholders not to sell their shares as it would constitute a breach of agreements.
