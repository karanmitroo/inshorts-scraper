The Union Cabinet has cleared the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018, aimed at seizing all assets of defaulters who flee India to avoid criminal proceedings. The bill provides for the establishment of special courts to prosecute absconding fugitives in cases worth â‚¹100 crore or more. Present laws allow confiscation of only the properties evaluated as proceeds of the crime.
