Israeli diamond billionaire Beny Steinmetz has been detained in Israel by police investigating allegations of fraud, forgery, and money laundering. The arrest follows an investigation into allegations that fake contracts had been drawn up to fabricate a number of property deals outside Israel. Notably, he was first detained last December over allegations that he arranged bribes to secure a deal.
