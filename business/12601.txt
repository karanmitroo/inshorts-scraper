Punjab National Bank (PNB) today declared United Breweries as a wilful defaulter on the â‚¹800-crore loan taken for Kingfisher Airlines. PNB had reported 93% decline in profits in the quarter ended December, as it had to set aside more money to cover bad loans, in compliance with new RBI directives. Earlier, SBI had declared the company as a wilful defaulter.
