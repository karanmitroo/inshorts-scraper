Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's vice chancellor and economy minister said there was "zero" chance of it paying World War Two reparations to Greece, following a renewed demand from leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. On Sunday, Tsiparas had laid out plans to dismantle Greece's austerity program, ruled out extension of its international bailout and vowed to seek war reparations from Berlin.
