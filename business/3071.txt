A family has settled a lawsuit against animal rights group PETA after it took a nine-year-old girl’s unattended dog and euthanised it before the required five-day grace period. PETA later said it would pay the family $49,000 (₹31.4 lakh) and called the incident a "terrible mistake". The family alleged PETA's broad policy of euthanising animals included healthy ones too.
