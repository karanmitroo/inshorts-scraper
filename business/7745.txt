Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry has alleged that certain decisions of Ratan Tata put thousands of jobs at risk, while adding that, it was a case of "one man's ego versus the institution." Mistry said this referring to the Corus' $12 billion acquisition and the decision to back CDMA for telecom business, which left the company "structurally challenged".
