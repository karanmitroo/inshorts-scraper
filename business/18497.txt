Petrol prices has been increased by Rs. 1.55/litre, without taxes, effective from Monday. However, diesel prices will remain unchanged. The price-hike is an effect of deteriorating USD-INR exchange rates and increase in international motor spirit prices. Petrol has been deregulated since June 2010 and its price is determined by the market price. However, government continues to control the price of diesel.
