Infosys' decision to return ₹13,000 crore to shareholders is “too little”, former Chief Financial Officer V Balakrishnan on Thursday said. Commenting on the appointment of Ravi Venkatesan as Co-chairman, he further said doing so would make the structure much more complex at the board level. Balakrishnan also labelled Infosys results for the March quarter as disappointing.
