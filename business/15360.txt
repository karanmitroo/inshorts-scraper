The Food Safety and Drug Administration (FDA) has ordered the recall of a batch of Maggi noodles from shops across India after dangerous levels of lead content were detected in the product. A lead concentration of 17.2 parts per million (ppm), nearly seven times the permissible limit, was found during routine tests, in all packets of Maggi noodles tested.
