The police have arrested two Burger King employees in the US for allegedly selling marijuana using the fast food restaurant's drive-thru window. The police duped the workers in a sting operation that revealed their code name for marijuana. This came after police were tipped off that customers who asked for "extra crispy" fries got marijuana with their meal.
