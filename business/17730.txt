The Rupee Friday rose to a near three-month high against the dollar, as heavy foreign buying sent shares to record highs although the currency ended the session with only a slight gain. The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.08/09 per dollar compared with 61.11/12 on Thursday. The unit rose as high as 60.945, its strongest since December 9.
