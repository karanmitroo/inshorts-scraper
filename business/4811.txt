United Airlines has apologised after a customer said a ticketing agent cancelled his reservation because he was recording their interaction. In the two-minute clip, the agent appears to tell her off-screen colleague to cancel his reservation because he "didn't have my permission to videotape". The agent can be heard telling the passenger that, "until that is erased you're not traveling".
