Japan's Suzuki Motor will invest about 100 billion yen (â‚¹6,400 crore) in a yet-to-be-functional second production line at its new Gujarat plant, reports said. The second line could debut in 2019 and will have the same capacity as the first production line, which is slated to start in 2017. This could raise the automaker's capacity to 2 million cars annually.
