As revealed by Narayana Murthy in a lecture at the New York University, Infosys received a buyout offer of $1 million in 1990 from an external investor. Since the Co-founders of the company wanted to accept the offer, Murthy, who turned 70 on Saturday, offered to buy his colleagues out although he "didn't have a cent in (his) pocket".
