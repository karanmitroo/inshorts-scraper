Prices of gold plunged by Rs 195 to Rs 26,675 per 10 grams in the national capital on Saturday due to weak global cues and strength in dollar. Sluggish demand from jewellers at current levels also weighed on the yellow metal. Silver followed suit, ending lower by Rs 200 to Rs 36,700 per kg on lack of buying interest.
