The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) officials on Friday failed to reach an agreement to cut oil supply, amid objections by Iran which refused to freeze its output, reports said. This comes after OPEC members earlier agreed over the need to cut output. The officials will meet again on November 25 to "finalise individual quotas", reports added.
