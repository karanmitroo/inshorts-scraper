British retailer Marks & Spencer will cut 500 jobs or around 15% of the roles at its London head office, reports claimed. The cuts are likely to be announced next Thursday and more than half of them will reportedly affect contractors. Earlier in April, the retailer had appointed Steve Rowe as its new CEO to check a fall in sales.
