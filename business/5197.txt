A tribunal has dismissed a petition by ousted Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry that alleged mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at group firms. The National Company Law Tribunal also refused to grant a waiver to Mistry's family-owned companies from a shareholding requirement that would've allowed the companies to file the petition. The tribunal will give a final order on Friday.
