As many as ten people were injured after an American Airlines flight heading to Philadelphia experienced "severe turbulence" with nearly 300 people on board. Passengers said the turbulence lasted for about 15 seconds. Jessica Huseman, a reporter who was on the flight, tweeted, "We all used our fleece blankets to mop the ceiling of the plane...after drinks went flying."
