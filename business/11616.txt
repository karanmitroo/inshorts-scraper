Oilfield services firms Halliburton and Baker Hughes on Sunday announced the termination of their $28 billion merger deal. Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes was valued at $34.6 billion when it was first announced in November 2014. "Challenges in obtaining remaining regulatory approvals and general industry conditions" have led to the deal falling apart, chief executive of Halliburton said.
