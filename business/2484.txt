US bank JPMorgan Chase has been routing customer orders for bitcoin-related instruments, despite the bank's CEO Jamie Dimon calling the cryptocurrency "a fraud". JPMorgan acts as an agent for buyers and sellers of Bitcoin XBT, an exchange-traded note designed to track the value of the cryptocurrency. The bank's spokesperson has said the orders are clients purchasing third-party products directly.
