American stock market index S&P 500 finished lower on Friday for the ninth-straight session, marking its longest stretch of declines since December 1980. This comes ahead of the US presidential elections and also amid expectations of a rise in US interest rates. Further, the dollar fell for a sixth straight day, the longest stretch of losses since March.
