LinkedIn on Wednesday said that Chief Executive Jeff Weiner will donate his annual stock package, valued at about $14 million, to its employees. The stocks will be awarded to employees over the next several weeks as part of the annual review. This move follows LinkedIn's disappointing first-quarter revenue and profit forecast. Notably, LinkedIn's stock dropped nearly 38% since the results.
