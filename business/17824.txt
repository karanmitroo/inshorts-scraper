Reeling under pressure to shore up profitability in its electronics business, Japanese conglomerate Sony has decided to pullout from loss-making PC and TV businesses. Consequently, it will cut 5,000 jobs and trim 100 billion yen ($988 million) a year from fixed costs. It is widely expected that the PC division will be sold to investment fund Japan Industrial Partners.
