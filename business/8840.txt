Infosys on Friday reported a 6.12% year-on-year rise in its net profit, which stood at ₹3,606 crore for the quarter ended September. Its total income for the quarter surged nearly 10% from the corresponding period a year ago to ₹18,070 crore. However, the company has cut its FY17 revenue guidance to 8-9% citing "near-term uncertain business outlook".
