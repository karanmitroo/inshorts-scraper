The founders of Slovenia-based exchange NiceHash have apologised after about $64 million worth of Bitcoins were stolen from its wallet. "Unfortunately, we became a target and someone really wanted to bring us down," NiceHash Founders Marko Kobal and Sasa Coh said. The attack had caused the company to shut down its website for 24 hours.
