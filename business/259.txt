South Korean government official Jung Ki-joon, who guided Seoul's regulatory clampdown on cryptocurrency, was reportedly found dead on Sunday. "He died from some unknown cause. He passed away while he was sleeping," a government official said. Jung Ki-joon had earlier said cryptocurrencies weren't a legal currency and the government will "strongly respond to excessive cryptocurrency speculation".
