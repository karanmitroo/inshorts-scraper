India's Mines Ministry has submitted a proposal seeking to scrap the 10% duty on the export of low-grade iron ore from Goa. This proposal comes after miners in the state requested the government's help to boost sales after the recent drop in prices, an official said. The low-grade ore produced in Goa is reportedly used mainly by Chinese steel mills.
