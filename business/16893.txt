India's export growth went down to a five-month low of 2.35% in August, while the trade deficit widened, touching a 4-month-high. The export growth was reported at $26.95 billion, while trade deficit jumped to $10.83 billion, owing primarily to the surging gold imports, which were reported to have increased from $738.7 million a year ago, to $2.03 billion last month.
