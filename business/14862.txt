The Delhi government has slashed VAT from 12.5% to 5% on utensils and cutlery items made of metal (except those made of precious metal), waxes of all kinds, wood and timber. The decision was taken as part of the Delhi Budget passed in June as the government works towards bringing uniformity in taxes. It came into effect on Saturday.
