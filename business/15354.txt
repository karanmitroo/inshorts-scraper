The government on Wednesday set up a panel headed by retired chief justice A P Shah to resolve the Minimum Alternate Tax issue. The panel shall examine "the related legal provisions, judicial/quasi judicial pronouncements and such other relevant aspects." The tax department's claims over previously untaxed gains amounting to 602 crores had rattled foreign investors, who have challenged the claims.
