A US judge has fined Apple $506 million (over â‚¹3,200 crore) for infringing a patent owned by US-based University of Wisconsin-Madison. The fine is more than double the damages initially imposed on Apple by a jury in 2015. Apple was found guilty of continued infringement of the patent, which relates to computer processor technology, even after the 2015 ruling.
