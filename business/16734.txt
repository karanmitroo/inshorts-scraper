US-based economist Arvind Subramanian was appointed as Indian governmentâ€™s new chief economic adviser (CEA) on Thursday. The post of CEA was lying vacant for over a year after Raghuram Rajan took over as RBI Governor on Sept 4 last year. The decision comes on a day when PM announced labour laws and Rajiv Mehrish was named as new Finance Secretary.
