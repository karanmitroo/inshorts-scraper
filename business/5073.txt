Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy, while speaking at a US university, said, "I want a stone on my grave that says: 'This was a fair person.'" "Fairness, to me, in every transaction, is extremely important," Murthy further stated. Notably, Murthy has defined success as "the ability to put a smile on the face of people when I enter a room."
