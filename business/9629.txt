Credit card group Mastercard is being sued for Â£14 billion ($18.6 billion), the largest legal claim in British history, over allegations that it overcharged 46 million UK consumers, as per court documents. The case alleges Mastercard set 'unlawfully' high fees on businesses that accepted its cards, which were passed on to consumers as higher prices for 16 years between 1992-2008.
