After Samsung recalled three million washing machines last year over reported explosions, it is now sending satellite television company Dish Network's technicians to make the repairs. Samsung said the size of the recall forced it to use a "nationwide network of service providers". Consumers claim that the technicians did not fully understand the repairs and tried selling them dish services.
