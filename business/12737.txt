Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that the states whose resources have been boosted after the implementation of the 14th Finance Commission are expected to increase spending on infrastructure and poverty alleviation schemes. The commission had last year recommended a record 10% increase in the states' share in Union taxes to 42%, which has been accepted by the Centre.
