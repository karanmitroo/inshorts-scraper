Andy Hall, nicknamed "God" of the oil market, is reportedly closing down his main hedge fund after big losses in the first half of 2017. His flagship fund, Astenbeck Master Commodities Fund II, lost almost 30% in June. Notably, Hall made $100 million (over â‚¹636 crore) trading oil for Citigroup in a single year during the global financial crisis.
