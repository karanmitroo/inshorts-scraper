The government on Wednesday extended the deadline for linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts to March 31, 2018, or 6 months from the date of commencement of account, whichever is later. Earlier in the day, the government had withdrawn the December 31 deadline. Last week, the deadline for linking of Aadhaar with PAN was also extended to March 31.
