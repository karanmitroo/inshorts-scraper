A gang which grew £50 million (₹420 crore) of weed in one of UK's biggest marijuana farms was caught by chance when police, while investigating a burglary, found a plant. Leader Michael Corcoran and 13 fellow members stole huge amounts of electricity to power production between 2013-2015. Corcoran has been jailed for 14 years, while others also face jail term.
