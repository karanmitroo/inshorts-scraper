Reserve Bank of India (RBI) canceled Sahara India Financial Corporation's certificate of registration as a 'Non-Banking Financial Institution' (NBFC) on Monday. The move came after Sahara allegedly violated financial regularities. Previously in July, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had cancelled the registration of Sahara Mutual Fund.
