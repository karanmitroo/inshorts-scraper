James Hogan is going to step down as the Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Airways in the second half of 2017 after leading the carrier for more than 10 years. This comes as the Abu Dhabi-based carrier tries to make a profit from its investments. Further, Chief Financial Officer James Rigney will also quit, Etihad said in a statement.
