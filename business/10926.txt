A US federal court on Monday ruled that two Starbucks customers may pursue a lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of cheating patrons by underfilling lattes. The two customers have alleged that Starbucks overcharges its customers by systematically serving lattes that are 25% too small. Starbucks spokesman, however, said that the company believed the lawsuit was without merit.
