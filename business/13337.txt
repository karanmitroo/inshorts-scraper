India’s largest biotechnology firm Biocon on Thursday launched a generic version of US-based Gilead Sciences’ hepatitis-C drug Harvoni under brand name ‘CIMIVIR-L’ in India. Biocon did not disclose the price of the 12-week medication, but assured that it would be substantially lower than its ₹63 lakh cost in the US.
