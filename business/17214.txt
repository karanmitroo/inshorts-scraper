Reliance Communications Wednesday raised $804 million by selling shares, in what is the single biggest equity issue since the pro-business Narendra Modi government took office, sources said. Reliance Communications had net debt of Rs. 401.78 billion ($6.7 billion) as of end-March. This was more than five times its operating profit, making it the most-leveraged among listed Indian carriers.
