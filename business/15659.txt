The government announced on Monday that prepaid mobiles in Jammu & Kashmir and in the  northeastern states will continue for 2 more years. The decision brought relief to the existing 33 million subscribers, and also the telecom operators whose license expires tomorrow. Pre-paid services were banned in these regions in 2009, to prevent threats to national security.
