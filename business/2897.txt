The government on Monday said GST will be applicable on fringe benefits an employee gets from his employer. "Fringe benefits are a supply of goods or services and are liable to tax if not exempted," it clarified. The government added that fringe benefits are "transactions in furtherance of business and even if supplied without consideration, the same are deemed supply".
