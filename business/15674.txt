Over 16 lakh refunds worth approximately 2,000 crores are lying unclaimed with the Income Tax department's Central Processing Centre due to lack of "correct data from taxpayers." The CPC is attempting to gather correct details of the legitimate recipients to make a refund. The recipients can also rectify the refund details on Income Tax department's official government portal.
