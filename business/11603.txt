The government has announced that it had deferred a decision on increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in AgustaWestland's joint venture with Tata Sons to assemble helicopters in India. This was reportedly based on recommendations from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). This comes after earlier reports that AgustaWestland had FIPB approval to start a joint venture with Tata Sons.
