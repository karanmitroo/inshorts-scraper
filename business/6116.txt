A Canadian court has awarded former Burger King cook Usha Ram $35,000 (over ₹23 lakh) in damages after she was sacked for taking home a fish sandwich, soda and fries without paying. The 55-year-old immigrant from Fiji had worked for Burger King for 24 years. She said that her manager had allowed her to take the food, worth around ₹26.
