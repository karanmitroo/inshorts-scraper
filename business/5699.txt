Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Saturday said it's time we promote reverse brain-drain, adding, "We have more talent knocking at our doors because at the end of the day, har ek ka dil hai Hindustani." People want to do things for India, Ambani stated. He further added "our brightest and best" should work for benefit of India and Indians.
