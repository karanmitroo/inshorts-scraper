American rapper 50 Cent has admitted he "never owned, and does not now own, a bitcoin account or any bitcoin." He added "the limited bitcoin transactions" that occurred earlier were converted to US Dollars based upon the then-existing exchange rate. It was earlier falsely reported that 50 Cent earned 700 Bitcoins in 2014, now worth over $7 million.
