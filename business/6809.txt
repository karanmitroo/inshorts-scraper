About 50,000 lives could be saved by 2030 annually if no new coal-fired power plants are built in Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, according to a study by Harvard University and Greenpeace International researchers. If the countries go ahead with plants that are planned or under construction, it would result in around 70,000 deaths annually, the study added.
