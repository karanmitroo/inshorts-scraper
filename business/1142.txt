US' Vice Media's Co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi have apologised saying the firm allowed a "boy's club atmosphere that fostered inappropriate behaviour". The statement followed a New York Times story that outlined 4 settlements by Vice involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation. NYT also reported that over two dozen women experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct at Vice.
