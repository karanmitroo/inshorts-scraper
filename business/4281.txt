Low-cost carrier SpiceJet on Monday signed an initial pact with the US aircraft maker Boeing for the new '737 MAX 10' planes. The agreement is for 40 aircraft, valued at about $4.7 billion (nearly â‚¹30,300 crore) at current list prices. With this, SpiceJet has become an inaugural customer for an aircraft designed to cut strong sales of Boeing's rival Airbus.
