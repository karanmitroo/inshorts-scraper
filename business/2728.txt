The National Company Law Tribunal has dismissed Vikram Bakshi's plea challenging termination of franchise agreement by McDonald's, and also issued a show cause notice to McDonald's in Bakshiâ€™s contempt application. It has asked McDonald's why contempt proceedings may not be initiated against the company. Earlier, McDonald's had informed NCLT that settlement with Bakshi was not possible.
