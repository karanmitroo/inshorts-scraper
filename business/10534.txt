Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the agriculture sector is not generating enough employment, and has failed to provide subsistence to farmers, who constitute over 55% of the population. "We can't afford to have 55% of people in the agriculture sector contributing 16% to the national GDP", Jaitley said, as this would create "inequalities".
