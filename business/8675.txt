The Finance Ministry has directed all the banks to replace the "compromised" debit cards of the customers for free, following a data breach that affected 32 lakh cards. The SBI had earlier blocked about 6.25 lakh debit cards over "suspicious" transactions at third-party ATMs. The worst hit banks are SBI, HDFC, ICICI and Axis Bank, reports said.
