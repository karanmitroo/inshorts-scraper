A rare pink diamond known as the "Pink Promise" has been sold for about $32 million at Christie's in Hong Kong. The 14.93-carat oval-shaped stone was set in a ring embellished with smaller diamonds. The sale comes after Sotheby's recently failed to sell the Raj Pink, a 37-carat stone that was estimated to be worth as much as $30 million.
