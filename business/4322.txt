Amazon will acquire Whole Foods Market in a $13.7 billion all-cash deal, marking the biggest transaction ever for the e-commerce giant. Whole Foods' John Mackey will remain CEO of the grocery chain, and the stores will continue to operate under Whole Foods. Before this, Amazonâ€™s biggest acquisition was in 2014, when it bought video-game service Twitch Interactive for $970 million.
