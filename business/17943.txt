Following the footsteps of Amazon India and Flipkart, online retailer Snapdeal has launched its version of guaranteed same-day shipping, called 'Express Delivery'. However, the service will initially only be available in Delhi-NCR and is only available on select products. Unlike its counterparts, the Snapdeal Express Delivery service is free (for now) and offers same day delivery.
