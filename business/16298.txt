The government on Thursday increased excise duties on petrol and diesel by Rs 2/litre each, which will be effective from Jan-1 midnight. However, the retail price of both the fuels will not be increased. The excise duty hike has been set off against the reduction in rates of petrol and diesel that was due because of fall in oil prices.
