Lieutenant General (retired) Tejinder Singh was arrested on Monday, after a Delhi court dismissed his bail plea, in the Tatra truck deal case. Singh has been alleged of offering a bribe of Rs. 14 crore, to former Army Chief General (retired) VK Singh, to clear purchase of nearly 600 all-terrain Tatra BEML trucks, in September 2010.
