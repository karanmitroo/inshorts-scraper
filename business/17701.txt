Infosys shares dropped as much as 9% on Thursday after the IT outsourcer said revenue growth in the current quarter ending March could be weak. Infosysâ€™s revenues are likely to grow 11.5% year-on-year in 2013-14 lagging peers such as TCS and HCL Tech. The management blamed muted spending by clients, especially in the retail sector, for its cautious outlook.
