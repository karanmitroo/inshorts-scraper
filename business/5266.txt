Shares in Anglo-German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor fell as much as 36% on Tuesday after a financial analyst warned that Apple may stop using Dialog's chips in iPhones. According to estimates, Apple accounted for more than 70% of Dialog's 2016 sales. However, Dialog maintained that it knew of "no business reason" for the shares' price movement.
