Services sector could attract a higher tax rate of 18% from the current 15% under GST, thus making services “slightly” more expensive, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said. However, those exempted at present, like healthcare, education and agriculture, are likely to remain so. He also said that some services which currently have less than 15% tax rate may attract lower rates.
