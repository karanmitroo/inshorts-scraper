BJP leader and former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had not applied his mind while rolling out GST. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should replace Jaitley by someone who can handle the Finance Ministry properly. "The current structure of GST is a faulty one and thats why the government is making amendments everyday," Sinha added.
