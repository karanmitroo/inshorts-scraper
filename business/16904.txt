Within only three days since Maruti Suzuki opened bookings for the upcoming Ciaz, the car has reportedly received over 3,000 orders. If the trend continues, the car might set a new pre-launch booking record in the mid-sized sedan segment. The car, expected to be launched in October, is likely to be priced between Rs. 7.5 to 10.5 lakh (ex-showroom).
