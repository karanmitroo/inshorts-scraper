The Rajasthan government has seized Robert Vadra's land after an investigation found inconsistencies in the deals, officials said on Sunday. The investigation found that Vadra had purchased large areas of land from fake sellers in Bikaner's Kolayat tehsil in 2010. Officials said Vadra then sold-off some of this land after a controversy broke out over the deals.
