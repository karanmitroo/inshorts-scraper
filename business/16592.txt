A cabinet proposal by the consumer affairs department plans to bring e-tailers such as Flipkart, Amazon, makemytrip, bookmyshow, and even direct selling under the consumer protection law. According to the proposal, if they fail to take back defective items and return the amount paid by a customer within a month, action can be initiated against such players.
