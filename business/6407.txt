Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday announced that the government has decided to utilise Head Post Offices as a front office for rendering passports. The objective of the move is to help people living far from passport offices. In December, the government relaxed passport norms by scrapping the requirement of submitting a birth certificate.
