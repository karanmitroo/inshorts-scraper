A Parliamentary panel on Monday asked the government to improve the performance of state-run power generation firm NTPC in the backdrop of lower-than-planned expenditure during the 12th Five-year plan (2012-17). This should not result in truncated target for NTPC's capacity addition during the next plan, the panel observed, adding it will, however, beat the capacity addition target for 2012-17.
