According to a report released on Monday by Asian Development Bank, India's energy sector will need 95.6% of energy investment requirements in South Asia (accounting to $2.3-trillion) by 2035. India's energy demand is projected to increase at 2.7% annually from 2010-35, slower compared to GDP increase at 5.7%. Energy pricing is a "core-problem" in India, ADB said.
