Interest Subvention Scheme, which allows labour-intensive and small scale sectors to avail loans at 3% lower interest rate from banks, was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday. The scheme will be implemented with retrospective effect from April 1, 2015, and will boost small and medium enterprises across various sectors which are unable to access foreign loans.
