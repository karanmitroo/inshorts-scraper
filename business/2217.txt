SBI's first woman Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya retired on Friday, over 40 years after joining the country's largest lender as a probationary officer. She said, "I've seen the bank from a long distance, from the days of huge ledgers to now when everything is on cloud." "I'm happy that I've future-proofed the bank," she added.
