Mutual funds have invested a net ₹6,573 crore in the equity markets during April-May this fiscal, according to data from markets regulator SEBI. This comes on top of ₹64,000 crore invested by them during 2015-16. Growing participation from retail investors, especially from small towns, and initiatives taken by SEBI have led to robust inflows, analysts said.
