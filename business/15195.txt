Microsoft opened its first rebranded Nokia Priority store christened as "Microsoft Priority Reseller Store" in Chennai on Wednesday. The rebranding follows Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia in a $7.2 billion deal. All the Nokia Priority stores are expected to run with the Microsoft Priority Reseller Logo by the month-end and Nokia Care will also be rebranded as Microsoft Care.
