The Supreme Court has ordered to shut down a phone tower after a man claimed that electromagnetic radiation from it gave him cancer, according to reports. The Gwalior-based man moved the court against a BSNL tower, which was installed 'illegally'. He noted the tower, which was near the house where he worked, exposed him to harmful radiation for 14 years.
