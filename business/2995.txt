The Bombay Stock Exchange will 'compulsorily' delist 200 companies from August 23 as trading in their shares has remained suspended for over a decade. Further, promoters of the firms would be debarred from accessing the securities market for 10 years. The move comes at a time when authorities are investigating shell companies allegedly involved in illegal fund flows.
