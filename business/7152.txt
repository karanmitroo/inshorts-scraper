Finance minister Arun Jaitley has said that India now needs to move to a lower level of taxation to be globally competitive. Extraordinary high taxation rates in the past have led to higher tax aversions, Jaitley stated. Further, voluntary compliance by citizens by payment of due taxes needs to be reciprocated by tax authorities by a tax-friendly administration, he added.
