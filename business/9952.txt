The Income Tax department's Mumbai office has received a tepid response to the Income Declaration Scheme so far, but the department hopes that the declarations will 'pick up' next month. The scheme, launched by the Centre on June 1 to unearth black money, closes on September 30. Under this, people can pay tax by cash in banks without any enquiries.
