Banks in India are expected to cut lending rates by up to 50 basis points (0.5%) by September as there is sufficient liquidity in the system, according to a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Notably, this comes after the RBI, in April, reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points to a five-year low of 6.5%.
