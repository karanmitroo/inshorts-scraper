The food regulators of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Assam have reportedly found nine products of major companies as "substandard" after they failed quality tests. These products reportedly include PepsiCo's Mirinda, Nestle's Cerelac Wheat, Parle Agro's Frooti and Marico's Saffola Gold oil. In most cases, the companies have questioned the test procedure or asked for a re-analysis, reports added.
