Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has won the reversal of a $72 million verdict awarded by Missouri jury in 2016. The verdict was initially in favour of family of a woman whose death from ovarian cancer they claimed stemmed from her use of company's products. J&J says it faces lawsuits by 4,800 plaintiffs nationally asserting similar claims over its talc-based products.
