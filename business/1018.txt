Rating agency Fitch has said that India has the potential to grow at an average 6.7% rate over the next five years. This puts India ahead of the 5.5% growth estimated for China and Indonesia, it added. The agency said India has an "impressive rate of capital accumulation per worker" which helps in maintaining economic growth and increasing living standards.
