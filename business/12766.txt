The BSE Sensex on Friday gained 278.54 points to close at 24,616.97, while the NSE Nifty rose by 85.10 points to settle at 7,489.10. Analysts attributed the gains to value buying in frontline blue-chip stocks and stabilisation of crude oil prices, amid mixed trends in other Asian markets and overnight gains in the US markets.
