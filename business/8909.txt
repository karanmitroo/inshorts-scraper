American investor Warren Buffett on Monday said he has paid federal income tax every year since he was 13, although he owed only $7 that year. His statement followed an exchange in the presidential debate wherein, Republican candidate Donald Trump accused Buffett of taking "massive" tax deductions. Further, Buffett released personal tax information, challenging Trump to do the same.
