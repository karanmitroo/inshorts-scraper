A West Bengal-based businessman, Pawan Jhawar, started a company last month by the name of 'Tata Sons', in London. After its discovery, a Tata Sons spokesperson said, "Such a move is in blatant violation of all laws, including our intellectual property rights over the usage of the word Tata." He added the group is considering legal options over the infringement.
