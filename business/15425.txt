Siemens AG CEO, Joe Kaeser, announced Thursday that the company is planning to trim 4,500 job in addition to 7,400 cuts planned earlier. About one-third of the job cuts will be from the energy division which accounts for 40% of Siemens' sales. Although, the company would keep underperforming businesses that account for 15 billion euros in sales and zero profit.
