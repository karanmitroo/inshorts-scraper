The Indian rupee on Friday touched a 26-month low of 66.89 against the US dollar, reportedly triggered by an equity and debt sell-off by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), among other causes. FIIs have already sold $2.36 billion in equity in the ongoing fiscal year, the steepest selling since 2009. The rupee has lost 5.5% since the start of 2015.
