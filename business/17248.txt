Former Goldman Sachs Group director Rajat Gupta(65) on Tuesday lost his challenge to a $13.9 million civil penalty, the same day he was scheduled to begin serving a two-year prison sentence. In 2012, a US court had convicted Gupta of passing confidential information to Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group hedge fund who is serving an 11-year prison sentence.
