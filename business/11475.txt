The Indian patent authority has granted approval to US-based Gilead Sciences' patent for its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. Notably, the patent for the drug, priced at $1,000 a pill, was rejected by the authority last year on the basis that it reflected only minor changes from the previous formulation, and the firm already had tie-ups with manufacturers in India.
