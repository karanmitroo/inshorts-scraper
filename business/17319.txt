Start-up carrier Tata-SIA Airlines, which is yet to get a flying permit, will acquire at-least 20 Airbus aircraft on lease from a Singapore-based firm to launch their operations in India by this winter. The deliveries are likely to start from "around Sept-Oct". Initially, it plans to operate two flights a day each to Mumbai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, from Delhi.
