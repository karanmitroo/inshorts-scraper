Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy has said he regrets quitting as the IT giant's Chairman in 2014, adding, he should've listened to other co-founders and stayed. "I am a very emotional person. A lot of my decisions are based on idealism and probably, I should have listened to them," he stated. Murthy recently criticised the current management over corporate governance issues.
