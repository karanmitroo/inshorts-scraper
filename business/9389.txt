Wholesale onion prices at India's largest onion wholesale market in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra have crashed to â‚¹3.50/kg, the lowest price recorded in the last five years. Analysts expect a further fall in prices due to excess onion production this year. The price downslide and possible shortages in future will continue until the government finalises an onion policy, officials said.
