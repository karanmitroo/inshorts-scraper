The Rajya Sabha on Thursday passed the four legislations which will enable the rollout of Goods and Services Tax Bill by July 1. The four Bills are the Central GST Bill, the Integrated GST Bill, the Compensation Bill and the UT GST Bill. Notably, the GST regime would absorb central excise, service tax, and other local levies.
