Politicians in the United States, including Democrat and Republican Presidential candidates, slammed Pfizer's takeover of Allergan on Monday in what they called a tax dodge. Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton said the deal "will leave US taxpayers holding the bag". Republican candidate Donald Trump called the deal "disgusting". The deal ensures Pfizer will no longer be taxed as a US firm.
