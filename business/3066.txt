In his personal blog on Friday, Vishal Sikka has blamed "unrelenting, baseless, and increasing personal attacks" for his decision to step down as Infosys CEO. Sikka said that he had no regrets from his three-year term as Infosys CEO. He further said he wanted to leave "because the distractions, the very public noise around us, have created an untenable atmosphere".
