After increasing prices of subsidised LPG cylinders by ₹76.5 over the past 17 months, oil companies skipped the monthly LPG price hike this month. However, prices of non-subsidised LPG cylinders were raised by ₹5 per cylinder to ₹747 in Delhi on December 1. The government has been rising LPG prices with a view to eliminate subsidies completely by March 2018.
