World's largest steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal on Thursday said it has entered a "definitive transaction agreement to sell its LaPlace and Vinton Long Carbon facilities in the US to an affiliate of Black Diamond Capital Management". The deal comes after reports of the Luxembourg-based steel maker being under debt which stood at $15.7 billion in the quarter ended December 2015.
