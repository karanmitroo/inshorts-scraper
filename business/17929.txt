US based Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. on Monday said it was terminating a proposed $2.5 billion sale to Apollo Tyres Ltd, after being informed by the Indian tyre maker that financing was no longer available for the takeover. Surprisingly, the termination was announced a day before the offer from Apollo was set to expire on Dec-31.
