Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Arvind Subramanian's Twitter account was hacked on Monday and a link to an adult dating site was shared from his handle. The account was subsequently restored and all objectionable content was deleted. "My twitter account was hacked. My profuse apologies for the nuisance/offensive tweets that were sent out as a result," Subramanian later tweeted.
