The Madras high court on Tuesday set aside the Tamil Nadu government's commercial taxes demand of Rs 2.4k cr on mobile handset maker Nokia. The court held that issuing demand notices on Nokia without affording an opportunity of hearing was not correct. However, it directed the Finnish handset maker to deposit 10% of the total demand immediately.
