Minister of State for Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan has dismissed reports that claimed residential areas would be acquired for the proposed Colachel port in Tamil Nadu's Kanyakumari district. â€œThe project will be executed without dislocating the local fishermen," he said. About 1,000 acres of land would be made available from the sea to build the port, Radhakrishnan further added.
