The government is considering easing limits on cash withdrawals once 80% of the new currency is introduced into the system, an official said. He added that the restrictions on cash withdrawals will be first eased in case of cooperative banks and then for all the scheduled commercial banks. As remonetisation is completed, restrictions will be removed totally, he added.
