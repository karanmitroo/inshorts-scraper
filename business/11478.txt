The Puthussery village panchayat in Kerala on Tuesday passed a resolution directing soft drink major PepsiCo to stop drawing groundwater for its plant at Kanjikode in the state's Palakkad district. This follows severe drinking water shortage in the area. Reportedly, the panchayat had already issued a similar notice to Pepsi a month ago but it has not yet responded.
