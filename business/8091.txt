The Indian rupee on Friday closed near a 15-week low against the US dollar, amid speculations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve under the newly elected US President Donald Trump. The rupee fell by 0.92% to close at 67.25 a dollar. "Rupee has come under pressure from outflows, anticipating Trumpâ€™s measures," analysts said.
