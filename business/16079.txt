Three weeks after acquiring Zip Phone, India-based messaging app Hike has rolled out a voice-calling feature. This becomes a significant development as Hike has managed to add a voice-calling feature before Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which is India's most-popular messaging app. WhatsApp has promised to add voice-calling features by 2015, but itâ€™s still unclear when exactly it will be available.
