Delta Airlines will offer up to nearly $10,000 (₹6.4 lakh) to passengers to give up their seats on overbooked flights. This is a jump from the previous cap of $1,350 (over ₹87,000). The move by Delta comes after United Airlines faced backlash after a video emerged showing a passenger being forcibly removed from a sold-out flight.
