Terming the decision to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes as a "master stroke",  Infosys Co-founder NR Narayana Murthy on Wednesday said the move will address issues like black money and corruption. Hoping the step will help the economy become more digital, Murthy added, "PM is working hard to reduce corruption. Black money is a scourge on any developing economy."
