Mahesh Bhupathi and Lara Dutta, brand ambassadors of Gitanjali Gems, have filed an insolvency petition against the jewellery manufacturer. The insolvency petition by the couple is for their contractual dues as an operational creditor. The couple had a two-year contract with Gitanjali for public appearances, but reportedly there were some cancellations for which the company didn't pay their dues.
