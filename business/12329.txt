Maggi samples collected from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh on February 5 were found to be "sub-standard", district authorities said. The ash content in Maggi Masala was found to be 1.85% against the permissible limit of 1%. However, Nestle refuted the claims, saying the standards for 'Macaroni products' are being applied for 'Instant Noodles with seasoning', which is "misleading".
