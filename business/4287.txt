Delhi Police has arrested the owner of a fake call centre, which allegedly duped 300 people on the pretext of providing them jobs in Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali. The company called victims for interviews, charged them security fee of ₹1,500-₹2,000, and gave them joining letters, before ending contact with them. Police said Narender Kumar, a science graduate, started the firm.
