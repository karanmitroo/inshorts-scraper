In reply to an RTI query, RBI has declined to share details of bank inspection reports, citing a transparency law section that exempts public authorities from disclosing information that can affect the interests of the country. The RBI was asked to provide copies of the annual financial inspection reports carried out between 2007-2015 of 19 banks it had penalised earlier.
