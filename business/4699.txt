The GST will subsume the present entertainment tax and service tax and hence, movie-going will get cheaper with a single 28% tax on cinema halls. The abolition of entertainment tax, which goes as high as 45% or even 100% across states, will effectively make cinema tickets cheaper. Moreover, race clubs and betting will also come under the 28% tax bracket.
