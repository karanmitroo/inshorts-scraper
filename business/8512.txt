After actor Pierce Brosnan demanded to be removed from Pan Bahar's campaign, promoter Mudit Jain said the brand's advertisements featuring Brosnan will continue to be aired. â€œThe advertising will continue as per schedule, as originally planned. There will be no change and will run its course," he said. Notably, Brosnan claimed Pan Bahar wrongly used his image for its campaigns.
