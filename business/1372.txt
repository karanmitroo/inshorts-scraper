Markets regulator SEBI has imposed a penalty of â‚¹10 lakh on Tata Steel over delays in making necessary disclosures. Tata Steel on multiple occasions failed to disclose its increased shareholding in a group firm, Tinplate Company of India, within the prescribed time. SEBI said the extent of loss suffered by investors cannot be computed, but defaults were "repetitive in nature".
