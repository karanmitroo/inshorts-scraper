The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has called for a ban on practices such as “private treaties”, in which a newspaper enters into ad-for-equity deals with private firms. “Newspapers cannot keep passing off ads as news. It is wrong,” Trai chairman Rahul Khullar said. Trai also recommended that newspapers should also be held accountable for paid news.
