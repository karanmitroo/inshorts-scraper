Former RBI Governor YV Reddy has said that while the Indian banking system faces a bad loans problem, it shouldn't be exaggerated. The banking system is still strong and there's no crisis, just efficiency issues and some past mistakes, he added. Notably, India's banking sector is saddled with a total of â‚¹8 lakh crore bad loans.
