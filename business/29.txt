The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has received details of jeweller Nirav Modi's accounts from a few foreign banks in connection with the $2-billion PNB fraud. The agency is also exploring all legal options to seize the money held in these accounts. The ED had earlier sent judicial requests to at least 6 countries for obtaining information about Nirav's overseas businesses.
