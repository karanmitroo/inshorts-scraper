Jet Airways has reportedly asked 200 junior pilots to go on unpaid leave for 10 days a month as part of a "lifestyle work pattern" resulting in a 30% reduction in their salaries. Jet Airways told them to revert by July 31 if they chose to seek other opportunities. It said the "interim alignments" to work patterns follow market developments.
