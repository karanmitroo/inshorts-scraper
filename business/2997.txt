Automaker Ford is offering cash to UK customers in a bid to get polluting vehicles off roads and boost sales. Ford will offer to pay drivers up to £7,000 (nearly ₹5.8 lakh) for cars and vans, if they replace at least eight-year-old vehicles with newer models. Notably, the scheme will target about 1.5 crore vehicles across the country.
