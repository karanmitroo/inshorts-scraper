EasyJet is seeking answers after a worker at France's Nice airport punched a passenger who was holding his baby at the terminal after a 13-hour delay. A picture of the incident was circulated online. "The man...went over and talked to the Frenchman and the Frenchman didn't reply, he just smiled and smirked and then whacked this guy," another passenger said.
