The Centre has decided to release 55% of its annual MGNREGA allocation of ₹38,500 crore for 2016-17 by June. This decision was taken as severe drought conditions in many parts of the country are expected to increase demand for work, officials said. Further, of the ₹21,000 crore released, ₹12,000 crore will reportedly be used by states to pay off arrears.
