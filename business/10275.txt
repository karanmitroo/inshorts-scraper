The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday passed the Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (Amendment) Bill, 2016, which was earlier approved by the Lok Sabha. The bill amends four existing laws and allows easier conditions for the secured creditors to take possession over a collateral upon a default during the loan repayment.
