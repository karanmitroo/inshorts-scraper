Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said that the "adventure" of demonetisation was not required at all, neither technically nor economically. He said demonetisation involved withdrawing almost 86% of the currency in circulation, and "there was bound to be fallout which we are all seeing". He further said the economy has slowed down due to demonetisation.
