Nissan had been conducting the same method of vehicle inspection process, that has been deemed faulty by the government last month, since at least 1979, according to reports. The findings will reportedly be part of a report from an external investigation team commissioned by Nissan. Earlier this month, Nissan said it is recalling 1.2 million vehicles in Japan for re-inspection.
