A Mumbai court has rejected Reliance Jio's plea to pull Airtel's 'Fastest Internet' speed advertisement off air. Jio stated the advertisement amounted to conspiracy, defamation, and breach of trust. The court, however, observed, "It's nothing but a marketing policy," and said firms are in competition, and claim themselves to be the best by way of advertisements to expand their business.
