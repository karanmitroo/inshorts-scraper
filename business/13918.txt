China on Monday raised the mid-rate of Yuan by 0.54% against the US dollar, the currency's highest rise in central rate in a decade. This move came three months after People's Bank of China devaluated the currency, which destabilised the global markets.  In the domestic forex market, China allows Yuan to trade up or down by 2% of central rate.
