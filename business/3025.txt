According to reports, former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka might have stayed on if the company had criticised Co-founder Narayana Murthy's interference in the day-to-day business sooner. A source said, "He had to take this extreme step for the board to come out explicitly in support." Sikka had reportedly discussed this with Co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan earlier.
