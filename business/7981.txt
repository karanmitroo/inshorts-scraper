US tobacco firm Reynolds American is seeking a higher price from UK-based British American Tobacco after rejecting its $47 billion takeover offer, reports stated. This will bring together brands like BAT's Lucky Strike and Reynolds' Camel to create the world's biggest listed tobacco firm. The companies are in talks and BAT is willing to increase the price slightly, sources said.
