President Pranab Mukherjee has given his assent to the Sugar Cess (Amendment) Bill, 2015, raising the ceiling on the cess imposed as an excise duty on the production of sugar from ₹25 to ₹200 per quintal. The cess hike had reportedly been proposed in order to meet the government’s expenditure on interventions to ensure payment of dues to sugarcane farmers.
