Overtaking the Argentine Peso as the biggest loser versus the US Dollar, the British Pound on Friday closed at $1.2941 to become 2016's "worst performer" among 31 major currencies. The third consecutive week of losses comes amid falling investor confidence following the 'Brexit' vote, analysts said. Earlier in the week, the Pound had touched a 31-year low of $1.2798.
