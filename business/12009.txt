The limit on the investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in government securities, including those of the states, has been increased by ₹14,000 crore to ₹2 lakh crore, with effect from April 4. This follows decisions by RBI and Sebi to increase foreign fund inflows into government securities. Notably, the limit was earlier hiked in 2015 and in January 2016.
