Reliance Jio has temporarily suspended pre-bookings for its JioPhone. This came after its website crashed for a short while on Thursday following large volumes of requests within minutes of launching the service. The firm is currently allowing prospective buyers to register their interest and check device order status online. According to Jio, millions of people have already pre-booked the phone.
