Although the Bombay High Court lifted the ban on Maggi noodles, Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said the government will continue to pursue its Rs 640-crore suit against Nestle India. "The decision of the Bombay High Court does not materially alter, either on law or on facts, the grounds urged in our complaint," Paswan added.
