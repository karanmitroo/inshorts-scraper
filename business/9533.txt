Two class-action lawsuits have been filed against textile major Welspun India, alleging that the company mislabelled its products as premium Egyptian cotton. Welspun committed a “widespread fraud” in which “consumers who... purchased Welspun bed linens... overpaid for an inferior product,” a plaintiff accused. Earlier, retailers like Target had cut ties with the manufacturer over the same issue.
