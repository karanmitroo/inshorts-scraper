Air India has removed meat from the menu for its economy class flyers on all domestic routes. The decision is expected to save the firm â‚¹7-8 crore annually. Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani said, "It also eliminates the possibility of mix-up: a non-veg meal getting served to a vegetarian passenger, as it had happened a few times in the past."
