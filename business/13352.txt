Brent Crude prices fell 2% on Monday to $36.05 per barrel, their lowest levels in over a decade. Oil prices have fallen 18.5% this month, their steepest monthly decline since the financial crisis in 2008. Analysts attributed the fall to OPEC's decision to not limit oil supply and lifting of a 40-year old ban on crude exports in the US.
