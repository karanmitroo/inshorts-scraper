Emerging-market currencies fell the most in more than two weeks, led by the Russian Ruble(-2.6%) and the Turkish Lira(-0.9%), after Moodyâ€™s Investors Service cut Russia's rating to junk and investors speculated Turkey will lower interest rates. Unrest in the middle-east and falling global oil prices have affected emerging markets, with the ruble losing 45% of its value in 12 months.
