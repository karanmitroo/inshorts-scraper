The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected the proposal from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) to allow 100% FDI in banks. Currently, 74% FDI is permitted in private banks and up to 49% is allowed under the automatic route. For holding beyond 49%, clearance from Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) is required.
