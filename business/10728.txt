The Union Cabinet on Tuesday gave 'in-principle' approval for developing a 'major port' at Enayam in Tamil Nadu. It will be built at an estimated cost of ₹25,000 crore and the initial equity investment will come from three major ports in the state – VO Chidambaranar, Chennai, and Kamarajar Port. When built, it will be the country's thirteenth major port.
