Euro countries, including France and Germany, will hold emergency talks on Tuesday as Greece rejected the bailout deal offered by its international creditors, with more than 61% people voting against the demands for further spending cuts. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras welcomed the referendum's outcome and said, "We proved even in the most difficult circumstances that democracy won't be blackmailed."
