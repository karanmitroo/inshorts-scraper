The apex consumer commission has directed real-estate major Unitech Hi-Tech Developers to refund ₹3.33 crore to a couple for failing to give them possession of an apartment. According to the complaint, the couple booked the flat for a total consideration of ₹3.39 crore. The commission rejected Unitech's claim that delay in handing over flats was due to shortage of labour.
