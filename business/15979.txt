Cab service provider Uber is planning to launch a "panic button" specifically for users in India. Starting Feb 11, riders in India would have an "in-app panic button that allows a rider to alert the local police at the push of a button...", Uber said. Also, a "safety net" feature would allow users to share their real time location.
