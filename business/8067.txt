The Punjab National Bank has installed a mobile ATM van outside the AIIMS hospital in New Delhi to ensure that people do not face inconvenience due to cash unavailability, reports said. This comes after the invalidation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, which has affected the cash circulation. AIIMS had earlier exempted clinical charges below ₹500 till November 11.
