Britain's largest bank HSBC is set to pay Swiss regulators a sum of 40 million Swiss francs ($42.83 million) to settle an ongoing investigation into money laundering and tax evasion by its private Swiss arm. No criminal charges would be filed against the bank after the payment of the sum, to 'compensate the authorities for past organisational failings.'
