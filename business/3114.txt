Amid a dispute with son Gautam Singhania, Raymond's Chairman Emeritus Vijaypat Singhania said, "I gave everything to my son and now I don't even have a house." The retired tycoon, who's struggling financially, further advised parents to love their children but not "blindly". Notably, Singhania is living in a rented apartment and Raymond has refused to release funds for it.
