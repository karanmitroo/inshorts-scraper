State-owned Coal India Limited (CIL) has announced that it will offer three million tonnes of coal under the third phase of its 'Special Forward E-auction' from February 16-18. Notably, the coal will be offered to distressed power plants, which do not have power purchase agreements. The first two rounds of auction for this fiscal were held last year.
