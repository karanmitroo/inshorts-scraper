Reliance Industries(RIL) has said it's being punished twice; first by levy of a $1.78-billion penalty for the crime of not meeting stated targets which is a breach of contract, and then by being denied a gas-price revision, until this matter is resolved. There is no provision under the Production Sharing Contract(PSC) that allows penalty for output due to geoligical-complexities.
