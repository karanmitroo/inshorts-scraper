Exports grew in double digits for the second month in a row in June at 10.22%, but a rise in gold imports pushed the trade deficit to 11-month high of $11.76 billion. The trade deficit rose as gold imports jumped 65.13% to $3.12 billion from $1.88 billion in the same month last year, after registering a negative growth since Oct-2013.
