Pakistan has lost 50% market share in Afghanistan in the last two years while India and China's shares have been rising, the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI) said. India's market share has been increasing in Afghanistan due to its export of products at subsidised rates. Pakistan's Peshawar city was the worst-affected by the declining trade.
