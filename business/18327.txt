The number of medical tourists coming to India has jumped by 40% in the past six-months, due to the falling value of rupee against foreign currencies, according to an Assocham study. The Indian medical tourism sector is likely to touch Rs 12,000 crore by 2015, from Rs 7,500 crore in the current market, with an annual growth rate of 25%.
