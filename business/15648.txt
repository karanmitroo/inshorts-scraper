HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh Sunday stressed on "aggressive" investment by the government as well as corporate houses in education. "For a country like India, spending on education is abysmally low at 3% of GDP. India has one of the youngest populations in the world and effective investment in education will determine how well the population is educated," Parekh said.
