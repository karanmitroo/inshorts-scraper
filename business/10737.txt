The Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved a long-term contract by signing an MoU with Mozambique for the import of pulses. The MoU is aimed at promoting the production of pulses in the African country, thereby doubling the trade between the two nations by 2020-21. This is expected to stabilise the price of pulses by meeting the current shortfall in supply.
