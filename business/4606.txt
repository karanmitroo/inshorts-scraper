NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya, while commenting on India's working-age population, has said that there was "robophobia" that automation would take away jobs. These fears however, he added, were "grossly exaggerated" and meant India's potential remained underestimated. "If we create a lot of good jobs, we can raise the growth rate to 8, 9, 10%," he further noted.
