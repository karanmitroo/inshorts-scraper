The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the signing of the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Cambodia, the first agreement to be inked on the basis of the model BIT text approved in December 2015. The treaty seeks to promote and protect investments from either country in the other's territory with the objective of increasing bilateral investment flows, an official statement said.
