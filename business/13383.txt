Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut Brazil's credit rating to junk, citing an economic slump that is taking the country towards its longest period of recession since the Great Depression. "The outlook for the rating is negative, meaning more downgrades may be coming," Fitch said. Earlier in September, Standard & Poor's also downgraded Brazil's credit rating to junk grade.
