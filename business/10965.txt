Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday told authorities that 4.9 crore more people must be brought into the tax net, up from the current 5.16 crore. He said, "There should be respect for law...and even fear of the long arm of the law for those who evade taxes." However, PM Modi did not give a timeline for the new target.
