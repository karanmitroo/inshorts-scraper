EU regulators have charged Facebook with providing misleading or incorrect information about its WhatsApp takeover. It refers to a privacy policy that allows WhatsApp to share users' phone numbers with Facebook, while Facebook had claimed data between the two services won't be synced automatically. Facebook faces a fine of 1% of its annual turnover if it can't explain its actions.
