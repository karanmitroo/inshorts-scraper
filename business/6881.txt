Air India on Monday said the FlightStats report, rating it the third worst international airline of 2016, was "fabricated". It said, "We totally disagree... Initially, it seems that the report is fabricated, so AI management will investigate the report till the end." Aviation insights company FlightStats claimed an Air India flight had a nearly 39% chance of a flight delay.
