Two German newspapers on Sunday reported that Volkswagen had received two letters, one from its supplier (2007) and one internal (2011), that warned it of the illegal emissions practices used in its vehicles. Volkswagen refused to comment on the matter. The company has been hit by the emissions test fraud scandal following which several countries have launched independent investigations.
