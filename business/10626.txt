The Income Tax department on Wednesday raided over 20 premises of real estate firm Indiabulls to probe a suspected tax evasion case of around ₹1,500 crore. Reports claim that the department was also looking into suspected 'benami' transactions worth ₹1,000 crore. Over 1,000 officers carried out the raids, which is being considered as one of the biggest in recent times.
