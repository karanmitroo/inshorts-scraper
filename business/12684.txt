Union Minister Nitin Gadkari today said apart from building smart cities, the government is also committed to offer affordable houses below ₹5 lakh. Only 1% of the Indian population can afford a house over ₹10 lakh, while 30% of the population would be able to buy houses if they are provided for under ₹5 lakh, he added.
