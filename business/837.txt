US software firm IBM and Denmark's Maersk have announced a joint venture that uses blockchain technology to track international cargo movement. The company will use distributed ledger technology behind blockchain to create an unchangeable record of transactions that can be shared real-time. Maersk, which owns the world's largest container shipping line, will be the first to use the new platform.
