Billionaire Bernie Ecclestone's daughter Petra Stunt has said that "when you are wealthy, people use you and want money out of you". Petra further said that money 'changes people' and causes them to 'become greedy'. Petra's statement comes amid a divorce battle with entrepreneur James Stunt over their £5.5 billion (nearly ₹46,000 crore) worth assets.
