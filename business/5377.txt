Pepsi announced on Wednesday that it is dropping an advertisement featuring model Kendall Jenner after facing criticism for 'trivialising' political resistance. "Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity... and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologise," the Pepsico unit said in a statement. "We also apologise for putting Kendall Jenner in this position," it added.
