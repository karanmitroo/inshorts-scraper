Low cost airline GoAir's CEO, Giorgio De Roni, has reportedly resigned due to health issues. De Roni, who is an Italian, had joined GoAir in 2011. The company made profit for two consecutive years during his tenure (2011-12 and 2012-13). However, its profit declined by almost 95% in the last financial year (2013-14).
