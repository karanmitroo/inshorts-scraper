UK's top executives' pay declined by 19%, as companies trimmed the amount bosses could earn from bonuses. Salaries fell to £3.5 million (₹28.9 crore) in 2016, from £4.3 million (₹35.5 crore) a year ago, a Deloitte survey revealed. Another report earlier found an average employee would have to work for 160 years to earn a FTSE 100 CEO's annual pay.
