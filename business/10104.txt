Infosys Foundation Chairperson Sudha Murthy was the first woman to be hired by Tata to work on its shop floor, after she protested against the company's job advertisement which mentioned "Lady candidates need not apply". Born 66 years ago on August 19, 1950, Murthy sent a postcard to JRD Tata in protest, and was later hired after an interview.
