The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said that imports of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) will require prior clearance of Directorate General of Civil Aviation and import licence from Director General of Foreign Trade. The move reportedly comes amid drones being considered a security risk. Drones have also been included in the prohibited list and flyers entering India have to declare them.
