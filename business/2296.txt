Volkswagen has halted the possible sale of its Ducati motorcycle unit amid persistent opposition from its labour groups, according to an Italian union leader. Volkswagen considered selling Ducati as part of an asset review that started last year, to examine options for operations that aren't a fit for its car and truck focus. Ducati's sale could have generated $1.8 billion.
