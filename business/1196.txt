A CAG report has said that Tata Teleservices, Telenor, and Videocon are among five telecom firms which have understated revenues by over ₹14,800 crore for the period up to 2014-15. This resulted in a shortfall of nearly ₹2,578 crore to the exchequer, the CAG added. Of these, the biggest defaulter is Tata, with a total short payment of ₹1,893.6 crore.
