State Bank India (SBI) has changed names and IFSC codes of nearly 1,300 of its branches, post its merger with associate banks. A list with the changes has been put up on the bank's website. "Even if some payment comes based on the old IFSC codes, it will get mapped with the new codes," MD Praveen Gupta said.
