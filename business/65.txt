Some 600 computers used to "mine" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been stolen from data centres in Iceland in what police say is the biggest series of thefts in the Nordic island nation. Police are monitoring electricity consumption to track the powerful computers worth almost $2 million and have arrested 11 suspects, including a security guard.
