Banks on Thursday started handing out new ₹2,000 denomination notes in exchange for the scrapped ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. Thousands of people flocked to banks and long queues were seen even before the banks were opened, reports said. The banks are reportedly giving a ₹2,000 note and twenty ₹100 notes because of the exchange limit of ₹4,000 per day.
