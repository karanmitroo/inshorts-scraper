A lawsuit filed by a New York-based investor in the Delhi HC accuses billionaire brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh of diverting funds to aid them with a $1.6-billion personal debt. The lending arm of Singhs' company, Religare Enterprises, made loans to firms which routed at least $300 million to Singhs' firms on the same day, according to an RBI investigation.
