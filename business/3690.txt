Arto Nummela, Chief Executive Officer of HMD Global, the Finnish company that owns the rights to use Nokia's brand, has stepped down with immediate effect. Nummela joined HMD Global last year after spending more than a decade at Nokia. An HMD spokesman said Nummela's departure was a personal matter between him and the company's board.
