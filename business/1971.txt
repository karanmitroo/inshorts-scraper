Reliance Industries became the first Indian company to cross ₹6 lakh crore market capitalisation after its shares hit a fresh lifetime high on Thursday. The company, whose shares surged 75% this year, had hit a market capitalisation of ₹5 lakh crore in July. The recent rally in the stock was due to tariff hike by its telecom arm Reliance Jio.
