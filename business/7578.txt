Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday conducted searches at 40 locations across the country in order to check black money. The raids were primarily aimed at currency exchanges, hawala dealers, and others in the wake of the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes. The agency is looking at instances of illegal exchange of old currency and stashing of new currency notes.
