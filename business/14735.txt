Ola Cabs will introduce 3,000 CNG vehicles in its fleet in Delhi, this week, although the cab aggregator may not immediately drop diesel taxis from its services in the Capital. Ola currently has about 25,000 cabs registered in Delhi, half of which use CNG and the other half run on petrol or diesel.
