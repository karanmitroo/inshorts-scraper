BP reported a net profit of $46 million for the quarter that ended September, a 96% fall against $1.29 billion net profit in the corresponding period last year. This downfall was majorly triggered by falling Brent Crude prices. The company's debt ratio rose to 20% against previous 15% largely due to $20 billion fines paid for Gulf of Mexico spill.
