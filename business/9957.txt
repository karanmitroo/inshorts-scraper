World's largest automaker Volkswagen on Thursday stated that it has reached a deal in principle to compensate 650 US dealers connected with its diesel emissions scandal. The settlement reportedly includes spending over $1.2 billion, plus continued incentive payments to dealers. Earlier in June, Volkswagen agreed to a $15.3 billion deal after admitting to have rigged fuel emission tests since 2009.
