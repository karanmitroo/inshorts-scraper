The Income Tax (I-T) department has reportedly activated a Permanent Account Number-based (PAN) online system to “cut down time in appeal and litigation management”. The system would enable assessing officers to “view appeals pertaining to their jurisdiction based on the PAN” in the department's database of over 5 lakh appeals and 1.5 lakh judgements.
