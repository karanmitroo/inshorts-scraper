Jewellers across India have decided to go on a three-day strike, starting on Wednesday, to protest the Budget’s proposal for the re-imposition of 1% excise duty and mandatory PAN cards for transactions of ₹2 lakh and above. "More than 300 associations, including manufacturers, artisans... will participate in the stir," All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation Chairman Sreedhar GV said.
