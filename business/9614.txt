Britain's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox on Friday said the country's businesses have become "too lazy and too fat". The pro-Brexit leader asserted that the country must make new trade relationships with the rest of the world. Earlier, Brexit supporters had argued that Brexit will give the UK an opportunity to forge relations with more dynamic parts of the world.
