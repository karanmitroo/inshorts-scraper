The Mines Ministry is developing a pan-India surveillance network using satellite technology to curb illegal mining. Called Mining Surveillance System, the technology will track mine lease areas and detect changes in topography. "This will inform us about the amount of ground exploited and…the volume of minerals stolen,” an official said. The system will scout mine sites once every 24-25 days.
