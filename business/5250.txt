After police officers dragged a passenger from an overbooked United Airlines flight, CEO Oscar Munoz said, "This can never, will never happen again." "We're not going to put a law enforcement official...to remove a booked, paid, seated passenger," he added. Munoz had earlier refused to apologise for the incident, but issued an apology after company's valuation fell by $1 billion.
