UK PM Theresa May has said, "I was described by one of my colleagues as a bloody difficult woman... And the next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker." May revived the line to respond to claims that the two clashed over Brexit negotiations. Juncker reportedly said it was "more likely than not" that Brexit talks would fail.
