Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal has said the government might withdraw the cheque book facility in "near future" to encourage digital transactions. He said the government needed to encourage use of debit and credit cards. Khandelwal claimed only 5% of total ATM cards are used for cashless transactions, while 95% are used for cash withdrawals.
