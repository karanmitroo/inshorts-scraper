According to reports, Tata Trusts, which hold about 66% stake in Tata Sons, had no visibility into the company’s future cash flows and were starved of information on units from Cyrus Mistry. Further, Mistry also didn't remove some members of his advisory council, despite staff costs doubling, the reports added. Earlier, Tata said growing “trust deficit” resulted in Mistry’s removal.
