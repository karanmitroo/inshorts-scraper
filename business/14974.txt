Taxi service provider Uber has been fined $7.3 million in California for refusing to provide information about its operations and services to the California Public Utilities Commission. A judge at the regulator body ruled that the company withheld information related to incidents like accidents. Calling the ruling "deeply disappointing", the company said it would appeal against it.
