The Chief Executive of TaxiForSure, Arvind Singhal, has resigned from the company amid major organisational restructuring. The move has come four months after the company got acquired by OlaCabs. Singhal, who has been succeeded by Pallav Singh - an early employee at Ola, will remain in a consulting role for three months to ensure a smooth transition.
