Mumbai-based Jet Airways has unveiled a new scheme, 'Fare Choices', where fliers can select or reject specific frills while booking tickets for accordingly higher or lower fares. The scheme, starting from August 17, will enable customers to book tickets early and customise their journey, an official said. There will be eight fare buckets, all offering free meals and baggage allowance.
