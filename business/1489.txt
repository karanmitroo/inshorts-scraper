Responding to criticism that government failed to create enough jobs, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said, "Lack of employment story...is quite exaggerated." He said a large number of areas have seen substantial increase in employment opportunities, though they may not be in organised sector. He added there is a significant jump in the number of employees within services sector.
