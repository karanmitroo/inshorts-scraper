The benchmark Sensex and broader Nifty ended flat in the week ended March 11, gaining 71.51 and 24.85 points to close at 24,717.99 and 7,510.20 respectively. Analysts attributed the gains to sustained capital inflows by foreign investors and hopes of a rate cut by the RBI, after the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% was retained in the Budget 2016-17.
