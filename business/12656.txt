The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday announced plans to "actively inject" more cash to support the banking system in March. This will be in addition to the short-term cash loans given to banks under RBI's Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). Banks have been claiming they cannot reduce lending rates, despite RBI's recent rate cut, due to "tight cash conditions".
