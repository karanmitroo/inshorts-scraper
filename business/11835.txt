The Employeesâ€™ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has postponed the implementation of the new Provident Fund regulations to August 1, allowing more time for full withdrawal of funds under old norms. The regulations, initially scheduled to take effect from May 1, restrict the withdrawal of interest on the employer's PF contribution and bar PF claims by subscribers before turning 57.
