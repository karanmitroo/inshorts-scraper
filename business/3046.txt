The government has threatened Philip Morris with "punitive action" over the tobacco giant's alleged violation of anti-smoking laws. This comes after reports suggested that Philip Morris was advertising Marlboro cigarettes at tobacco shops and distributing free smokes at nightclubs to young people to promote the brand. The government also sent a letter to ITC for using similar promotional tactics.
