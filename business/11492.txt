The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down telecom regulatory body TRAI's recommendation making it mandatory for telecom firms to compensate customers for call drops, stating the law was "arbitrary" and "non-transparent". This was in response to a petition by telecom operators challenging Trai's regulation which stipulated a compensation of â‚¹1 per call drop, limited to three such calls a day.
