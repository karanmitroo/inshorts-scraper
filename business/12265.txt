German Car maker Volkswagen was sued for â‚¬3.3 billion ($3.7 billion) in a case filed on Monday in Germany in connection with the company's emission scandal. The case was filed on behalf of 278 institutional investors from around the world. This comes nearly six months after Volkswagen admitted to installing software in its diesel engine vehicles to manipulate emission tests.
