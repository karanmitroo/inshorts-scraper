LeEco CEO Jia Yueting has apologised for making "inappropriate" comments about boosting the share price of LeEco's main listed subsidiary Leshi. "Hope everyone could pool their efforts to bring the price to 100 yuan (about â‚¹990)," Yueting had told the investors. Leshi's shares climbed as much as 8% to a two-month high after Yueting's apology.
