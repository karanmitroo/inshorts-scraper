Following rumours that the â‚¹2,000 notes have errors and will be withdrawn, India Today has clarified that these rumours are false. It was claimed that 'do hazaar rupaya' written in Hindi was printed in error as 'don hazaar rupaya'. In regional languages like Marathi, 'do' is 'don', and hence there are no printing errors in the notes, the report clarified.
