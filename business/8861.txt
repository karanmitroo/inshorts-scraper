The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a 43-year-low to 2,46,000, which could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. It was the 84th consecutive week that the number stayed below 3,00,000, the threshold for strong labour market conditions. The possible hike reportedly hurt US stocks with the dollar falling against several currencies.
