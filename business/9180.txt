Terming terrorism as the "biggest threat" to India's financial and economic stability, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said that decisive action against terrorism will spur growth. This comes after the Indian Army conducted surgical strikes on terror launchpads in Pakistan's territory on Wednesday night, which Finance Minister Arun Jaitley termed as 'pre-emptive action'.
