Oil companies on Sunday increased the price of petrol by 1 paisa/litre and diesel by 44 paise/litre. In Delhi, non-branded petrol will now cost ₹68.09/litre while non-branded diesel will cost ₹57.35/litre. "The current level of international product prices of Petrol & Diesel and INR-USD exchange rate" warrants a change in petrol and diesel prices, IOCL said.
