According to a regulatory filing, e-commerce major Amazon told Whole Foods that it would "disengage from its efforts to acquire the company" if Whole Foods countered its bid of $13.7 billion. Amazon also threatened to walk away if the acquisition talks leaked to the press. The all-cash deal, which was announced in June, marks the biggest transaction ever for Amazon.
