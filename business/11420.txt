Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that investors need to pay taxes on money earned in India. This comes in the wake of announcement of revised tax treaties with Mauritius imposing a tax on capital gains on investments from the country. India no longer needs "tax-incentivised route" to attract foreign investments as Indian economy is now "strong enough", he added.
