Sainsbury’s Chairman David Tyler has been reprimanded after using the supermarket’s staff to renovate his country house. The board sent him a warning letter after an investigation concluded there were “material breaches” of company policies which it viewed as an “extremely serious matter”. Tyler had also paid $6,200 (over ₹4 lakh) to charity in recognition of work done by staff.
