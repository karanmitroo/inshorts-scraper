Budget airline SpiceJet is expected to order 92 jetliners from airplane manufacturer Boeing in a deal valued at $10.1 billion (around â‚¹69,000 crore), Bloomberg reported. The deal would more than double SpiceJet's fleet. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money.
