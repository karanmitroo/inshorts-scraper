Finance Ministry has reduced the gross budgetary support to the railways to ₹32,000 from ₹40,000 crore announced in the railway budget. The support was slashed by ₹12,000 crore in November, citing low spending by Railways in first six months of the fiscal. But, the reduction was reduced to ₹8,000 crore after the railways sent an explanation to the government.
