Bank of America has said that money managers showing concerns about earnings growth after seeing US equities surge to records, is an "ominous" sign. According to the bank's latest survey, just 33% of managers say corporate profits will improve, down from 58% at the start of the year. At the same time, a record 46% said equity markets are overvalued.
