Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has expressed his intentions to invite the US to OPEC’s next meeting to stabilise global crude prices. Maduro said on Friday that he is pushing for an “alliance" of OPEC and non-OPEC members, including the US and the world's "most important oil companies". OPEC had last month agreed to limit production to reduce global oversupply.
