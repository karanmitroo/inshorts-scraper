The US economy may face longer and deeper recessions in the future if interest rates remain stuck at current low levels, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said on Monday. He added that the Federal Reserve is "very close" to achieving its US employment and inflation targets. The dollar, stocks and the US Treasury yields all fell after Fischer's comment.
