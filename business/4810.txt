A United Airlines passenger claims she was forced to urinate in a cup because attendants told her she couldn't leave her seat with the "fasten seatbelt" sign turned on. The passenger said she was humiliated in front of others. She had already gotten up to use the restroom when the plane hit turbulence, and she was asked to return.
