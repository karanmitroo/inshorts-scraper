Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier said on Monday that it is expanding support operations for its business jets, hiring 200 technicians, and expanding service centres in Europe, the United States and Asia. This comes amid a sustained slowdown in business jet sales, as many manufacturers are positioning to capture more sales of products and services after planes are sold.
