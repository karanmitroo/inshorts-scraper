The National Stock Exchange is delisting 14 companies from its platform effective August 31, as these entities are winding up their businesses. The companies to be delisted include Prudential Capital Markets, and SMZS Chemicals among others. In April, NSE had named 80 companies for compulsory delisting as trading in their shares had been suspended over a long period of time.
