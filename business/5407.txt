Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka defended the rise in compensation of COO UB Pravin Rao, stating, "It is essential for us to see that this revision in his compensation...is focused on making Infosys more competitive." It is critical to retain key talent, Sikka added. His statement comes after Co-founder Narayana Murthy, in a letter, said Rao's pay hike was "not proper".
