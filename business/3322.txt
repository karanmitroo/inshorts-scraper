Bharti Airtel has been asked to refund â‚¹44.5 with a 12% interest to a consumer for data loss, caused due to internet services blockage during the Patidar quota agitation in 2015. The consumer had approached a Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission after Airtel refused to refund the amount. The commission noted that not refunding amounted to unfair trade practice.
