India on Wednesday approved a $150 million credit line for the development of Iran's Chabahar port, the government said. Under the agreement signed between India and Iran last year, India will equip and operate two berths in the first phase of development at Chabahar Port. Notably, the two governments had initially agreed to develop the port in 2003.
