A 39-year-old Dutchman, Didi Taihuttu, sold everything that he owned for Bitcoin and moved his family to a campsite. He had sold his house for 85 Bitcoins and claimed that he was waiting for the next “boom” in cryptocurrencies. Taihuttu, who has a wife and three daughters, also sold off his children’s toys and other consumer durables.
