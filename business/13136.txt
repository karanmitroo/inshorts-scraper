Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said that 40 national and multinational banks including Citibank, Barclays and ICICI are willing to partner with India Post for its upcoming payments bank. India Post had received an approval from RBI last year to offer banking services to retail customers. The bank is expected to be operational by March 2017, Prasad added.
