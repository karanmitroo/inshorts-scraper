Tata Sons has slapped a legal notice on ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry for alleged breach of confidentiality by making public sensitive and confidential documents. Earlier, Tata Sons had issued a letter to Mistry accusing him of twisting facts and using harmful means to take control of the group. Mistry had last week resigned from all Tata group companies.
