A leaked British Cabinet Office memo which claimed that the country lacked a strategy for leaving the European Union was written without government input, consulting firm Deloitte said on Tuesday. The note stated that government departments were working on over 500 projects related to leaving the EU and may need to hire additional 30,000 bureaucrats to deal with the workload.
