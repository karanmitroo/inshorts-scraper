In a move to clear out stocks of the iPhone 5S ahead of its next iPhone launch, Apple is offering an extra Rs 1,500-2,000 in margins to online retailers on its outgoing flagship device. The discount, when combined with the usual discounting by e-commerce sites, has reduced the price of 5S by about Rs 8,000 (to Rs 38k-39k), as compared to offline stores.
