Country's second largest IT firm, Infosys, has crossed the $2 billion revenue (Rs 12,000 crore) mark in Europe for the first time, driven by strong demand for consulting and system integration (CSI) services. The Bangalore-based company, which reported revenues of $8.24 billion for the year ended Mar-31, 2014, saw the European region accounting for 24.4% of the topline.
