Tata Sons' ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry on Sunday in a letter said the group has “unfortunately stooped” to a low level in public statements regarding the independent directors. He said, it was truly unfortunate that independence of directors at the group firms is being questioned. On allegations of group companies drifting away, Mistry said, "This is furthest from the truth".
