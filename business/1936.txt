Ex-Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said that demonetisation is the biggest man-made disaster to hit India, worse than the tsunami or Mumbai floods. Calling demonetisation a decision taken in ignorance, he said "small and medium enterprises have been wiped out, and businesses have been shut down" as a result. Someday, someone will conduct a probe into this matter, he added.
