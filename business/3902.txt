Major TV networks are intentionally misspelling names of programmes in order to avoid low ratings. When episodes perform badly, networks introduce errors before submitting it to ratings firm Nielsen, so that these are counted as separate shows and don't bring down the average rating. In this regard, NBC aired 'NBC Nitely News' instead of 'NBC Nightly News', among others.
