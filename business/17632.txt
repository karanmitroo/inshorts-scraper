Infrastructure finance company IDFC and Kolkata-based microfinance firm Bandhan Financial Services Wednesday won banking licences, with RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan approving permits for only two of the 25 applicants. This comes a day after the Election Commission permitted it to go ahead with the issue of new licences. Other applicants included India Post, Anil Ambani group and Aditya Birla group.
