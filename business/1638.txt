Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has invested $50 million each in the Dementia Discovery Fund, and start-up ventures working in Alzheimer's research. Gates said this is a personal investment and not one offered through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "People should be able to enjoy their later years and we need a breakthrough in Alzheimer's to fulfil that," Gates said.
