Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries has clarified that it has no plans to launch an app-based taxi service as it sees no logic in diversifying into unrelated sectors, according to a Reliance official. This comes amid reports that Reliance Jio will launch a taxi service and has ordered 600 cars. Reliance Jio earlier this week announced a strategic partnership with Uber.
