Apple has filed a petition in a US court asking Samsung to pay an additional $180 million in their on-going patent infringement case. This comes two weeks after Samsung agreed to pay Apple over $548 million for the same. Apple claims the penalty is for interest and supplemental damages related to five Samsung smartphone models sold after 2012 jury verdict.
