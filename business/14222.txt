An inter-ministerial group led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday introduced a slew of measures to control prices of pulses which hit record highs of ₹190/kg after a disappointing monsoon season. The government introduced measures like using the ₹500 crore Price Stabilisation Fund, setting up a buffer stock of imported pulses and mobilisation of existing stock to control prices.
