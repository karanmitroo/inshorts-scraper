Vijay Mallya's lawyers on Tuesday told a London court that the Indian government's fraud case against Vijay Mallya is politically motivated. They argued Mallya is being used as a scapegoat by politicians to deflect public anger at accumulation of bad loans by state-owned banks. They also accused several political parties, including the BJP, of making "political capital" from the case.
