Actor Amitabh Bachchan on Tuesday took to Twitter to complain about Vodafone's network, where rival Reliance Jio stepped in and offered him a SIM. Jio tweeted, "Sir, we would be happy to deliver a Jio SIM to you & activate it instantly through our Aadhaar based eKYC home delivery process". The glitch was later fixed and Bachchan thanked Vodafone.
