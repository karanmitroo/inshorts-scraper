Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved on Thursday entered into a partnership with brick and mortar retailer Future Group to sell its FMCG products through the latter’s stores. "[W]e would have ₹30-40 crore business (from Patanjali products) in a month from our stores and later on it would increase up to ₹80 crore," Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani said.
