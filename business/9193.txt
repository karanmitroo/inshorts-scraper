The Centre will borrow ₹2.45 lakh crore for the second half of the financial year starting from October, keeping the gross borrowing for the period unchanged from the Budget estimate. This will help in meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% for 2016-17. In the Budget, the government had pegged the gross market borrowing for 2016-17 at ₹6 lakh crore.
