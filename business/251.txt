Bank of Baroda had classified the ₹435 crore loan given to Vikram Kothari-run Rotomac Global a "non-performing asset" in October 2015 and a "fraud" in December 2017. However, a complaint accusing Kothari of defrauding 7 banks of ₹3,700 crore was filed in February 2018. The escape of PNB fraud accused Nirav Modi reportedly prompted the bank to file the complaint.
