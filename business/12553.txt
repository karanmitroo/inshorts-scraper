Nestle, the worldâ€™s largest food and drinks company, reported a sales growth of 4.2% in 2015, thereby missing its own estimates for the fourth consecutive year. Net profits dipped 39% year-on-year. The results were affected by, amongst other reasons, a five-month ban imposed on Maggi by the Indian government. Globally, the company experienced a downward pressure on food prices.
