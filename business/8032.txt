Pakistan's leaders on Sunday inaugurated a new international trade route by seeing off a Chinese ship exporting goods to the Middle East and Africa from Gwadar Port. Reports suggest China is seeking convenient and reliable access to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. The new route gives China access to the Persian Gulf region and the Middle East.
