The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has urged people to be "very discreet" about their Aadhaar and other identity documents, and not share the document number or a printed copy with anyone. While submitting Aadhaar copies, self-attest it and state the purpose to avoid misuse, UIDAI tweeted. Further, in case of misuse, one can take legal action, it added.
