Micro-ATMs are portable devices that allow banking transactions including cash deposit, withdrawal and fund transfer using debit or RuPay cards. The micro-ATM identifies the customer through an identity proof, generally the Aadhaar, which is linked to their bank account. The bank representative carrying the machine acts as the cash cache. The micro-ATM also prints a receipt for all transactions.
