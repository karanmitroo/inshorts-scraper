Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group's shares have surged 500% this year, valuing the company at $52 billion. This comes in response to a widely expected backdoor listing of its real estate assets in China, and share buybacks. Evergrande Group's shares also rose about 9% on Tuesday after it raised $9 billion from selling a stake in a property unit.
