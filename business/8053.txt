The RBI on Sunday said the currency printing presses are running at "full capacity" to sustain demand for new notes. It further urged people to switch to other modes of payment such as debit and credit cards to reduce strain on bank branches. "Adequate stock of all currency notes has been kept ready at more than 4,000 locations," RBI added.
