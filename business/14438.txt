ITC is expecting a 300% jump in revenue of its agricultural business division to Rs 18,000 crore by FY 2021, majorly driven by retail initiatives in rural markets. ITC's agri-business expects a turnover of Rs 6,500 crore in the ongoing fiscal, a majority of which is generated by an online supply chain network in villages called 'e-Choupals'.
