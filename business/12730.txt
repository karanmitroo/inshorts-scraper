After the restrictions on the onion exports were lifted in December 2015, around 1.5 lakh tonne of onions is being exported from India every month. Export deals were contracted at rates around $250 per quintal as Indian onions are preferred over others, exporters said. Reportedly, overall onion production is expected to improve by 10-15% in 2015-16 subject to weather conditions.
