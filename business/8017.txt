Former RBI Governor C Rangarajan on Monday cautioned that the demonetisation of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes will "hurt" the retail sector and affect Indian economy if it is continued for a longer time. However, Rangarajan praised the move and said it would reduce the circulation of black and unaccounted money in the country.
