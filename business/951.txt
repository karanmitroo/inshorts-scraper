Swedish fashion retailer H&M apologised for an advertisement showing a black child in a hoodie bearing the words, 'Coolest monkey in the jungle' while also recalling the controversial garment from their stores. This comes after people slammed H&M, calling the advertisement "racist" and "unacceptable". "This image has been removed from all H&M channels," said a spokesperson.
