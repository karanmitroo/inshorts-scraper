India-based airline GoAir has moved Bombay High Court against the rival airline IndiGo over the use of 'go' in their domain name 'goindigo.in'. Notably, Google has also been made a defendant party by GoAir in the suit. However, GoAir's advocate clarified that it is not because the word 'go' is a part of Google's corporate and domain name.
