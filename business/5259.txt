Petrol pump owners across India threatened to not purchase petrol and diesel on May 10, and shut outlets every Sunday if demand of higher margins is not met, reports said. The weekly Sunday off will start from May 14, while from May 15 dealers will operate from only 9 am-6 pm. The agitation would continue till higher margins are announced.
