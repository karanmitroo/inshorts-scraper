Samsung is reportedly considering to split its electronics business into two. The split would allow the heirs of Samsung's founding Lee family to focus solely on smartphones, one of the most important businesses of the Samsung Group. Samsung Electronics plans to split into a holding vehicle for ownership purposes and an operating company.
