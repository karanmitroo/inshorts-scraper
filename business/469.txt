RBI Governor Urjit Patel has said the central bank's projections indicate inflation for 2018-19 will be around 4.5%. The RBI is expecting retail inflation to rise to 5.1% during the March quarter of this fiscal due to rising crude oil prices and hike in salary components of government employees. The RBI on Wednesday kept the repo rate unchanged at 6%.
