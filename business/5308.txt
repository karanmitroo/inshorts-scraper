The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Patanjali Ayurved have decided to sign a memorandum of understanding to market herbal products developed by the DRDO's Life Sciences wing. "Patanjali has wider network in the country and therefore we think DRDO will benefit with the former in taking its products to the masses," said Life Sciences wing's head Sashibala Singh.
