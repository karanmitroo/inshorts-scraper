Former Union Minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday alleged that PM Narendra Modi had held up Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill for four years. "PM Narendra Modi's support for GST is an afterthought... I personally met him and then leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj... I can tell you, he was the reason," he said.
