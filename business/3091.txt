Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon in a letter to employees said US President Donald Trump missed a "critical opportunity" to bring the US together. This came after Trump failed to condemn white supremacists and instead blamed "both sides" for violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia. The riots led to the death of a woman after a car rammed into the crowd.
