The External Affairs Ministry on Friday suspended liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s diplomatic passport on the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) request. The ED had written to the Ministry on April 13, after Mallya failed to appear before the agency thrice in connection with its money laundering probe into the ₹900 crore IDBI bank loan fraud case.
