Financial services major HSBC has set a benchmark BSE Sensex target at 30,500 for December, 2017 saying that structural reforms like demonetisation and GST will push growth in the long run. "[I]f we move towards transparency and know where the money is coming from and also have GST, we would have much less incentive to...not contribute to development," HSBC said.
