The RBI on Tuesday kept its key lending rate, repo rate, unchanged at 8%, in line with economistsâ€™ expectation, signalling that the central bank is not ready to lower the guard on inflation. The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was also kept unchanged at 4%. The central bank, however, reduced the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) to 22.5% from 23%, starting mid-June.
