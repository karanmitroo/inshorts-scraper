India's largest lender SBI on Wednesday cautioned its cardholders of potential legal, financial and other risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, it did not ban the use of its cards for such investments. Earlier this month, Citibank India had banned the use of its credit and debit cards towards purchase or trading of cryptocurrencies.
