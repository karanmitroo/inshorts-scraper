US' National Advertising Review Board has asked telecommunications company Comcast to stop its claims of providing "the fastest internet in America", which it had based on Ookla tests. Comcast's rival Verizon had first challenged the ads in August 2016. Interestingly, Verizon itself was asked to back down on claims that it was "number one in internet speed" last year.
