Flipkart has tied up with mobile phone retailer Spice Hotspot to facilitate customers to look at its phone collection at select Spice Hotspot's outlets before buying them online. This move is mainly targeted at customers from Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities and would offer customers the "convenience of online retail and the touch and feel in-store experience of offline retail".
