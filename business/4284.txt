The Income Tax department has ordered coercive action against Cairn Energy to recover â‚¹10,247 crore of retrospective tax. This follows an international arbitration panel deciding not to entertain a plea by the UK oil firm seeking injunction against such action. The department will now move to take over the 9.8% Cairn Energy shareholding in Cairn India, reports said.
