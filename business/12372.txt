The government will set up a panel to devise a strategy for the consolidation of public sector banks (PSBs), Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Saturday. This comes after PSBs reported their highest aggregate quarterly loss during the last quarter due to mounting bad loans. Meanwhile, the government is also considering employee stock option plan for state-owned banks, he added.
