The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Tuesday said that it is planning to set up an Institutional Trading Platform for listing start-ups. Moreover, it also halved the listing time to six days from the date of the public offer. These moves are expected to attract start-ups that might have gone for overseas listing.
