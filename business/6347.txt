Tata Sons on Monday removed former Chairman Cyrus Mistry from the board of the holding company after shareholders voted in favour of a resolution that had sought his ouster. With Mistryâ€™s removal, the Shapoorji Pallonji family has lost representation on the board for the first time in a decade. Notably, Mistry's family owns an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons.
