The Income Tax department on Thursday confiscated over ₹4 crore in searches against at least two individuals in Bengaluru in one of the biggest seizures of new currency. The amount was mostly in ₹2,000, some ₹100 notes, demonetised ₹500 notes, and a few gold biscuits. "Some entry operators and bankers are under the scanner," a senior official said.
