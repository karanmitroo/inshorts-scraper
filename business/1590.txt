The Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the establishment of National Anti-profiteering Authority under GST. It is aimed at ensuring that benefits of reduction in GST rates are passed on to consumers by way of reduced prices. The authority would enable consumers to apply for relief if they feel the reduction in prices is not being passed on to them.
