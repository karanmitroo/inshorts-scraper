Amazon's Diwali Dhamaka deal turned out to be bad experience for the visitors, as its website crashed at 7 am (just when the sale opened) on Friday. After the website crashed, Diwali Dhamaka deals were not visible, reports said, adding that those who managed to get through too were not impressed with what was on offer.
