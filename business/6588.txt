India's largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki India posted a 47.5% rise in net profit to ₹1,745 crore for the December quarter, against the year ago period. The growth was attributed to an increase in the share of the company’s higher segment models, including Baleno and Brezza. This also came as average car prices in India went up.
