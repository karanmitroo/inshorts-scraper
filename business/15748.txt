The Indian Government has allowed 7 unnamed state-owned banks to raise capital from the markets by sale of shares. A finance ministry statement on Wednesday said that the move is to conform with global Basel III banking rules. The government had earlier earmarked a lesser-than-expected $1.26 billion for capital infusion in state banks in the next fiscal year.
