Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has said that Reliance Jio's strategy is unprecedented, and Airtel will combat it with better pricing, bundling of data packs, and reducing operational costs. Although, Airtel is not going to offer services for free, he added. Jio will benefit the telecom sector and reduce the number of telcos from the current eight to four, he stated.
