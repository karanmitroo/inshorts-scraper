Digital currency Bitcoin has risen over 1000% in 2017, reaching an all-time high of $10,800 after it crossed $10,000 for the first time on Wednesday, also pushing its market capitalisation to over $180 billion. With this increase, ₹100 worth of Bitcoin in July 2010, when the currency was priced at just $0.06 (₹2.8 then), is now worth nearly ₹2.3 crore.
