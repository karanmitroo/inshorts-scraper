Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday promised "far greater autonomy" for state-run banks to run business with a "commercial mindset". Speaking on the sidelines of a bankers' retreat in Pune, Jaitley said, "There are unacceptable levels of NPAs (non-performing assets) in some cases and the banks have to be given a sufficient amount of leeway."
