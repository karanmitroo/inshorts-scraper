China's central bank on Thursday allowed its yuan currency to drop against the dollar for a third straight day, although the devaluation was smaller than ones earlier this week. The People's Bank of China, or PBOC, cut its so-called guiding rate against the dollar by 1.1% but also issued assurances that the currency was not in free fall.
