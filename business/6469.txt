In the Union Budget speech on Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said demonetisation is a decisive measure which seeks to create a new normal wherein the GDP will be bigger, cleaner, and real. The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon be normal, he added. Further, he said the effect of demonetisation will not spill into next year.
