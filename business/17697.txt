A worldwide survey (by GMAC) of B-school alumni revealed that 45% of those who graduated between 2010 and 2013 preferred self-employment - almost double the proportion of their seniors who opted to pursue their own dreams in the 2000-2009 period. The survey, conducted among nearly 21,000 alumni representing 132 institutions from 129 countries, covered batches from 1959 to 2013.
