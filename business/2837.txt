Over 70,000 people have signed a White House petition asking to declare billionaire investor George Soros a terrorist. The petition accuses Soros of sedition against US, and demands that he and his affiliates be declared "domestic terrorists" and his assets be seized. The petition, initially launched on August 20, would require 1,00,000 signatures before September 19 to garner a response.
