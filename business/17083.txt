Following an all-time high share value, Tata Consultancy Services on Wednesday became the first Indian company to cross Rs.5-lakh-crore market capitalisation. TCS' nearest rival in terms of m-cap is state-run ONGC (Rs.3.5 trillion). Interestingly, among IT companies, TCS' m-cap is more than the combined m-cap of its nearest three rivals - Infosys (Rs.1.90tn), Wipro (Rs.1.39tn) and HCL Tech (Rs.1.07tn).
