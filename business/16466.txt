E-retailer Amazon Tuesday added a new 'bidding' feature to its website, allowing customers to bid for lower prices on more than 150,000 items, including fine art and rare coins, sold by third-party vendors. The new "make-an-offer" was distinct from an auction because price negotiations are private and a customer will never pay more than the listed price, Amazon said.
