Food safety regulator FSSAI has sought public opinion for allowing up to 5% vegetable fats, other than cocoa butter, and up to 50% artificial sweetener Isomaltulose in chocolates. FSSAI added that these ingredients will be mentioned on labels as per regulations. This could reportedly  benefit importers as the import and sale of chocolates containing vegetable fat is not allowed in India.
