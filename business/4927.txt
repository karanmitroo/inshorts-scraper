The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared an ordinance to empower RBI to reduce bad debts of public sector banks. The amendment will empower RBI to issue directions to banks to recover dues from loan defaulters. It will also allow RBI to set up oversight panels that will shield bankers from later action by probe agencies looking into loan recasts.
