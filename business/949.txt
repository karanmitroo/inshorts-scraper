The government has extended the deadline for linking Aadhaar with small saving schemes by three months to March 31, 2018. The 12-digit Aadhaar number was made mandatory for all small savings schemes, including post office deposits and Kisan Vikas Patra, in October 2017. Meanwhile, the deadline for linking Aadhaar to avail welfare scheme benefits was also extended to March 31.
