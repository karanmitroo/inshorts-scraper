RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday cautioned the government against economic growth driven by an increasing fiscal deficit. Any compromise on fiscal consolidation may hurt India's macroeconomic stability, India's "single most important strength during this period of global turmoil", Rajan said. The government and RBI should instead continue their focus on bringing down the inflation, he added.
