US automaker Ford's CEO Mark Fields on Tuesday announced that the company is scrapping plans to build a â‚¹10,900-crore small car production plant in Mexico. This comes after US President-elect Donald Trump criticised Ford for shifting jobs out of the US. Ford, USA's second largest automaker, had planned to shift production to Mexico to cut costs amid declining car sales.
