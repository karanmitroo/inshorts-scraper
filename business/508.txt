The Food Ministry has reportedly proposed doubling the import duty on sugar to 100% to curb cheaper imports. A recommendation has been made to the Finance Ministry to hike the duty from the current 50% to protect domestic sugarcane farmers, reports added. Sugar industry bodies had sought intervention as ex-factory prices of sugar have fallen below the production cost.
