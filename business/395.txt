The World Bank has said that India needs to create more regular, salaried jobs with growing earnings rather than self-employment to become a middle-income country by 2047. It said that salaried jobs are a "rare privilege" in India today where less than 20% of workers are in salaried employment. India is currently classified as a lower middle-income country.
