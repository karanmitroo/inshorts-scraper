Aiming to create awareness among people to prevent them from writing anything on currency notes, RBI said, "If anyone writes anything on the currency note at the front of a banker then he may deny to accept that note". It added that overwritten cheques will also be considered invalid by the banks and would not be accepted from Jan-1, 2014.
