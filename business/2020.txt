The RBI on Saturday clarified that the linkage of Aadhaar number to one's bank account is mandatory in applicable cases. This comes a day after several reports claimed that Aadhaar number linkage with bank accounts is not mandatory, quoting an RTI application. Earlier, banks had warned customers that their accounts will be suspended if they aren't linked to Aadhaar.
