Sports Direct has introduced a staff survey system at an England warehouse, wherein workers have to press a touchpad featuring a happy and sad face emoji when they clock in. If employees press the sad emoji, they can be called in by managers to discuss their grievances. The touchpad uses fingerprint recognition technology to identify those who express discontent.
