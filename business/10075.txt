Coal India workers have called for a nation-wide strike on September 2 to protest against further divestment and strategic sale in the sector. However, Coal India said that efforts are being made for conciliation. Notably, around 5 lakh bank union workers and officers will also be joining a nation-wide strike called by all central trade unions on the same day.
