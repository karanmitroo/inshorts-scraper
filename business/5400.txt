Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Tuesday said he had granted approval to Aircel-Maxis deal "in the normal course of business". Chidambaram's remarks come after Supreme Court asked CBI to file a status report on the probe being carried out on the deal. Earlier, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had alleged that Chidambaram illegally granted clearance to the deal in 2006.
