‘CoCo’ bonds, typically sold by European banks, offer investors a higher interest rate in exchange for the bank having an option not to actually pay the interest (and possibly not to have to pay back the bond). Such bonds have dropped sharply in value this year and are contributing to a wider selloff in stocks of European banks.
