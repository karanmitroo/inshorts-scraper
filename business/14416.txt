Commodity futures regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) is set to merge with capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Monday for creating a unified regulatory body. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced this merger in his budget speech this year amid the speculative activities in the commodities market including the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) scam.
