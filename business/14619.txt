Italian energy group Eni on Sunday claimed to have found one of the world's largest natural gas fields off Egypt's coast- 4,757 feet beneath the surface covering an area of 100 square kilometres. Eni, the biggest foreign energy firm in Africa, estimated the expanse to hold around 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, or 5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
