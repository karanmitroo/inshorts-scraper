Nepal's central bank has developed a software to facilitate exchanging banned Indian notes in the country. This comes while Nepali banks have been facing an extensive shortage of 100-rupee notes for people who want to visit India. The RBI reportedly indicated that they would only allow exchange facilities for up to â‚¹25,000 to each Nepali citizen.
