Reducing the interest rates, the State Bank of India will now offer home loans above Rs 75 lakh at 10.10% (10.30% earlier) for male borrowers and 10.15% (10.25% earlier) for female borrowers. The cut comes on the back of improved liquidity and slower pick up in corporate credit. For loans below Rs 75 lakh, existing rates will continue.
