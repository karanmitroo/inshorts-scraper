The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to issue a stay order on the notification scrapping ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes while hearing a PIL. The apex court said the order appears to be "carpet bombing" and not a "surgical strike" like the Centre claimed. It also directed the Centre to submit details of steps taken to ease inconvenience faced by citizens.
