In a relief to Samsung, the Competition Commission of India has ruled out any anti-competitive conduct by the handset major in connection with sale of spare parts and equipments for its mobile phones. A complaint, filed with the CCI, had accused Samsung of creating a monopoly by restricting sale and supply of genuine spare parts, diagnostic tools, and so on.
