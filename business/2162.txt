Disruptions from demonetisation and events surrounding the implementation of GST led to a setback in India's economic momentum, said a World Bank report. It added that the growth is expected to slowdown from 8.6% in 2015 to 7% in 2017. According to the bank, GST is expected to disrupt economic activity in early 2018 but has the momentum to pick-up.
