India Gate rice, the countryâ€™s largest-selling rice brand, is exempt from paying GST as the company didn't get the brand name registered under the Trade Marks Act 1999. This is because GST on staples like rice, wheat and cereals is zero. However, branded rice became costlier in many states under GST as a 5% tax has been imposed on it.
