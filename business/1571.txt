Johnson & Johnson has won a lawsuit in California against a woman who claimed she developed cancer after being exposed to asbestos in the company's talc-based products. The company in a statement said its powder has been around since 1894 and it does not contain asbestos. Over 5,500 people have filed cases against the company for its talc causing cancer.
