Sutirtha Bhattacharya on Monday assumed charge as Coal India's full-time chairman and managing director, a post which had been lying vacant for over six months. Prior to this, Bhattacharya was the CMD of state-owned Singareni Collieries Company. The Public Enterprises Selection Board had in November recommended Bhattacharya, a 1985 batch IAS officer, for the top post at Coal India.
