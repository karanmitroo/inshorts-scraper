Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday launched the one-day Make in India conference in Sydney and asked Australian businesses to make investments in India. Speaking at the event, Jaitley said that India could become a low-cost services provider but has failed to become a low-cost manufacturing hub, adding that the campaign has given it a chance to become one.
