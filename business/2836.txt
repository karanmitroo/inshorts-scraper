Infosys ex-Chairman R Seshasayee on Friday said Co-founder Narayana Murthy carried out "personal attacks" against him and made "patently false and slanderous accusations". Murthy earlier said that Seshasayee had told him that the board agreed to pay former CFO Rajiv Bansal a large sum of money as it "felt generous". Seshasayee said his words were taken "completely out of context".
