Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian-led GST panel has recommended a three-tier structure with 17-18% standard tax on most goods and services, 12% on essential goods and 40% on 'demerit' goods like luxury cars. The panel suggested a 15-15.5% revenue-neutral rate (single rate at which the government incurs no loss). It further recommended dropping the 1% additional tax on inter-state sales.
