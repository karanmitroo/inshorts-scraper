RBI Governor Urjit Patel on Wednesday asked the Central and state governments to bring down the high borrowings while keeping inflation low and stable for long-lasting higher growth. "Our general government deficit (borrowing by the Centre and states combined) is, according to IMF data, amongst the highest in the group of G-20 countries," Patel has said.
