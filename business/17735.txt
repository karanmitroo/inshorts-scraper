Owing to slower economic growth, salary hike for employees of at least 565 companies in the country in 2014 will be the lowest in five years at 10%, compared with 10.2% in 2013. "The years 2012-14 are witnessing a sort of plateauing in salary increases, as compared with the high double-digit increases in the last decade," a consultancy official said.
