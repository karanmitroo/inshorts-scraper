According to Nestle India, over 50 million packets of Maggi have been sold in 21 days since its relaunch on November 9. Even reports of the presence of lead in samples of Maggi's Pazzta did not impact Maggi sales, according to retailers. "Maggi noodles have altogether created their individual brand visibility in the market," an e-tailer said.
