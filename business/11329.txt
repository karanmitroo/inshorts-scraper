Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to give Greece access to bailout loans of €10.3 billion ($11.5 billion) and short-term debt relief measures, such as locking in lower interest rates and easing repayment schedules. This is the second instalment of Greece’s third bailout package, worth €86 billion, agreed last August. Notably, Greece’s debt stands at €321 billion, 180% of its GDP.
