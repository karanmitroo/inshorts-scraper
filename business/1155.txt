On being questioned about what went wrong in partnership with McDonald's, the company's estranged partner Vikram Bakshi said, "It was my doing because no brand wants a strong partner." He further said that most brands would prefer a "subservient" partner than a strong partner. "McDonald's and I need to take a step back and think about the brand," he added.
