E-commerce major Flipkart is in talks to acquire a majority stake in digital mapping company, MapmyIndia for around $60 million. The acquisition can help Flipkart strengthen its logistics and customer analytics. “The deal would allow all investors in MapmyIndia to get an exit. The promoters could, however, retain some stake in the firm,” a person familiar to the development said.
