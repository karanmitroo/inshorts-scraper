CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday warned Jindal Steel Works  that unless it completes its steel plant project in  West Midnapore, the state government would take back all 4,000 acres acquired for it. In 2007, JSW had signed an agreement for Rs 35,000 crore, but there isn't much progress despite an ultimatum from the Trinamool government in March last year.
