The Development Bank of Singapore plans to introduce its latest banking innovation in India by year-end, enabling customers, for the first time in Asia-Pacific, to use natural language to converse with DBS from their preferred mobile messaging app. The tool will also allow customers to track expenses, and make payments, among others. Earlier, DBS launched India's first mobile-only bank "digibank".
