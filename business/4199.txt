Canadian lender Home Capital Group's shares soared as much as 27% on Thursday, after billionaire investor Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway agreed to provide a $1.5 billion loan. Berkshire is buying a 38% stake in the troubled lender, which has been accused by regulators of misleading investors about mortgage fraud. Shares of other Canadian lenders also rose on Thursday.
