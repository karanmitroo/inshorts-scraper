After a gap of 35 months, the S&P BSE benchmark Sensex crossed 21,000-mark due to hectic buying mainly in realty, auto, banking, consumer durables, and refinery sectors along with continuous foreign capital inflows. The NSE 50-share Nifty also rose by 0.97% to 6,238.35. However, Asian markets were trading lower in their early trade as China's money-market rates continued to surge.
