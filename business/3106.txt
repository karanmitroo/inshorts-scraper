Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the government has full sympathy with the agitating Noida homebuyers and they can seek relief under the insolvency law. Many home buyers staged protests after NCLT admitted insolvency plea against Jaypee Infratech for defaulting on a â‚¹526 crore loan. The company has reportedly handed over only 5,500 flats out of the proposed 32,000.
