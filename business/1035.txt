Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said that the government will not take knee-jerk decisions on cryptocurrencies. Adding that 11 cryptocurrency exchanges have been identified in India, he said the government is awaiting a report from an expert panel set up to examine cryptocurrencies. Last week, the government said Bitcoin and the other digital currencies are like Ponzi schemes.
