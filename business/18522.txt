The depreciating rupee has resulted in nearly 1,200 small and medium diamond unit owners in shutting shops, thereby making at least 25,000 workers jobless since last Thursday. Babu Lekhadia, a diamond entrepreneur in Varachha, said, "We have to buy rough diamonds in dollars, which is very expensive at the moment. It is better to shut down the unit."
