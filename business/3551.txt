The Ministry of Railways has cancelled a caterer's contract after a passenger found dead lizard in vegetable biryani served on Howrah-New Delhi Poorva Express. The passenger had ordered and eaten the dish without noticing the lizard but felt unwell later, a co-passenger tweeted. The incident follows CAG's report stating food on trains is "unfit for human consumption".
