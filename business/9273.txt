Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank's (DB) shares fell to the lowest level since mid-1980s on Monday, reports said. This comes amid reports that the government has refused any state-aid to the bank before elections next year. Earlier, the IMF had said that DB was the biggest risk to the financial system due to its intertwined relations with international lenders.
