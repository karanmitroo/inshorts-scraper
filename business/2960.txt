Harvard researchers investigating nearly 200 ExxonMobil climate change documents since 1977 claim to have found "grave discrepancies" between what the oil giant internally acknowledged versus its public denial. "80% of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt," the researchers wrote.
