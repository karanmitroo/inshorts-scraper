The RBI kept its key policy repo rate unchanged at 8% on Tuesday, as widely expected. Moreover, the RBI lowered the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), by half a percentage point to 22% to free up more money for lending, effective from Aug-9. The repo rate has been unchanged since January, when the RBI increased it by a quarter percentage point.
