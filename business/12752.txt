The Income Tax (I-T) Department on Friday cautioned taxpayers not to share confidential or financial information over e-mail. “The [department] never asks for your PIN numbers, passwords or similar access information for credit cards, banks or other financial accounts through e-mail,” it said, while also directing taxpayers not to open such e-mails falling in spam folders or reply to them.
