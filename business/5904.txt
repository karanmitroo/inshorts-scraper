World Bank's CEO Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday said that demonetisation will have a profound and positive impact on India’s economy. "What India has done will be studied by other countries. There hasn’t been such demonetisation in a country so big," she added. Georgieva compared India's decision to that of the European Union, which is also phasing out high denomination bills.
