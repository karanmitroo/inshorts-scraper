Fox News fired Bob Beckel, a co-host on the prime-time programme "The Five", for making an "insensitive remark" to a black employee, the cable-news network said. The employee who made the complaint was a technician assigned to do work on Beckel's computer. Beckel "stormed out of his office," saying he was leaving because the worker was black, lawyers claimed.
