The World Bank has said the "adverse effects" of demonetisation in India will disappear in the medium term, saying any reform has short-term costs. However, the World Bank cut its estimates of India's growth rate in 2016-17 to 7% from the previous projection of 7.6%. An official also said that demonetisation will help in reducing the size of informal economy.
