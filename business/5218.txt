HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has said an average of 15 lakh graduate engineers pass out every year, and four-fifth of them are not employable due to lack of adequate skills. This is despite having more than 3,300 approved engineering colleges in the country, Parekh stated.  Teachers need to undertake necessary training so that students become employable after graduating, he added.
