Reliance Jio has filed a complaint with the Advertising Standards Council of India, accusing Airtel of airing misleading ads on network data speed. Jio has asked for action to be taken against Airtel's new advertisement, which claims it's 'officially India's fastest network'. Jio questioned the methodology used by Airtel, stating it can't use the word 'officially' in its advertisements.
