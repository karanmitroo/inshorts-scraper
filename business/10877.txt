According to reports, the 8th India-China financial dialogue at the level of Secretaries which is scheduled for June 27 was postponed to July. The meeting was deferred due to the inability of Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das to travel to Beijing as he was asked to stay back in India in view of the 'Brexit' referendum on Thursday.
