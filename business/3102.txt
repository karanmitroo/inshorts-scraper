Rebecca Allen, a vice president at Goldman Sachs has filed a lawsuit against the bank and one of its managers, claiming she was discriminated because she is black and Jewish. She claimed that Goldman's all-white senior leadership team favours white bankers for promotions, so they earn more than black co-workers. However, the company said the claims were meritless.
