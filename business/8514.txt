Cyrus Mistry has denied filing caveats at the National Company Law Tribunal against Ratan Tata, Tata Group, and Tata Trusts, according to reports. This comes after reports claimed that Mistry had filed four caveats against the Tatas. Earlier, Tata Sons filed caveats in all courts to prevent Cyrus Mistry from getting ex-parte order against his sacking.
