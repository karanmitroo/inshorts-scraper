Private sector lender Axis Bank on Wednesday said there was no loss to its customers from the recent cyber attack on the company. This comes after cyber-security firm Kaspersky warned the bank of a data breach. Axis bank later sent a preliminary report to RBI and hired audit and advisory firm, Ernst & Young, to carry out an investigation.
