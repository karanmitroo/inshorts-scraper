Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar-led Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) on Monday enhanced the offset threshold for defence deals to ₹2,000 crore from ₹300 crore. A mandatory 30% indigenous share will now be applicable to contracts worth ₹2,000 crore and above. The DAC also cleared ‘Indigenous Design Development and Manufactured’ as the preferred category over the existing ‘Buy (Indian)’ category.
