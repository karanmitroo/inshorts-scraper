BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan has said 1,000 companies will list on his bourse over four years. Smaller firms that become tax-compliant due to GST, scheduled for implementation on July 1, would want to go public because they won't have anything to hide. Notably, 74 companies raised $4.3 billion through first-time share sales on BSE in last fiscal, highest since 2010.
