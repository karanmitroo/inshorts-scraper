IMF chief Christine Lagarde has urged Arab countries to slash public wages and subsidies to curb spending, achieve sustainable growth and create jobs. Lagarde added that Arab public spending remains very high, especially in oil-rich Gulf states where government expenditures exceed 55% of GDP. She warned that higher growth and stringent reforms were needed to create jobs for young Arabs.
