Retirement fund body Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Monday fixed 8.65% as the interest on provident fund deposits for 2016-17. This is against the 8.8% rate provided in 2015-16. The lower interest rate is due to the poor rate of return on investments made by the EPFO in all spheres, according to sources.
