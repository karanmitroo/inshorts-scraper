Vodafone Monday moved the Delhi High Court alleging the Centre is indulging in "coercive" tactics by refusing to sign its unified licence (UL), till the telecom major unconditionally accepts the "restrictive" clauses in the licence. The company said "if UL is not signed in a timely manner, then 22 million subscribers will face disruption of services after November 29, 2014".
