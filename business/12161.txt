NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya on Monday said that India should emerge as an attractive destination for manufacturing firms that are exiting China because of its rising wages and demographic transition. The move will help create jobs in India, he added. He also said that India's transformation can only be pushed by bringing in workers into non-agricultural sectors.
