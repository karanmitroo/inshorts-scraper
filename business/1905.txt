RV Deshpande, a Congress minister from Karnataka, called GST a "game changer and good reform" but said it should be made simpler by reducing tax slabs and rates. He said the changes are required as "small traders and businessmen are suffering". On demonetisation, Deshpande said he initially welcomed the move but it has failed to achieve its stated objective.
