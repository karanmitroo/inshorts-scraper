RBI Deputy Governor SS Mundra on Thursday asked the banks not to be "over-zealous" while lending, saying it leads to over-indebtedness of customers. The resultant default in repayment could harm the individual's credit rating, he added. Meanwhile, banks should expand the direct benefit transfer facility to all identified government schemes to improve financial inclusion, he further said.
