The government on Wednesday confirmed the introduction of new ₹200 notes by RBI for the first time. While no immediate date has been specified, the new notes could reportedly be introduced by September. The ₹200 note will fill in the 'missing middle' even as new currency in circulation has reached 84% of pre-demonetisation level, SBI said earlier.
