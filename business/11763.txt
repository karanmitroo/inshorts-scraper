Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler on Friday said that it is recalling more than 1.1 million cars and SUVs worldwide over fears that the vehicles may roll away after the drivers exit. The automaker said that the recall is linked to as many as 41 injuries caused because the drivers mistakenly believed they had parked the vehicles before exiting.
