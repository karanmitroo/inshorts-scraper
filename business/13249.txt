Apple on Wednesday agreed to pay $347 million to the Italian tax authorities to settle a tax dispute. Apple's Italian subsidiary was proved guilty of evading corporate tax of $962 million between 2008-2013 by transferring its profits to Ireland, where tax rate is lower than Italy. However, Italy agreed to close the case at one-third of the total amount evaded.
