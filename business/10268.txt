An Israel-controlled oil firm Trans-Asiatic Oil has been ordered to pay $1.2 billion to an Iranian oil company by Switzerland's Supreme Court. The dues are linked to a partnership formed before Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. The court also reportedly ruled that there were no legal obstacles for Israelâ€‹ to pay Iran since the sanctions against Iran were lifted.
