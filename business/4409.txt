The Unique Identification Authority of India has refused to share information on fake and duplicate Aadhaar cards, saying the disclosure might affect national security. Replying to an RTI query, UIDAI also refused to give details of action taken in such cases. The format in which information is held, contains identity details which, if divulged, could lead to identity-theft, it said.
