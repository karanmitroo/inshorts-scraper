Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) chief Ross McEwan said the bank “would just be too big for the economy” of an independent Scotland. He said the company will move its headquarters out of Scotland if it votes for independence. However, the move will not endanger the jobs of 12,000 RBS employees, he added.
