Finnish utility firm Fortum on Tuesday said it will invest in India €200-400 million (around ₹1,500-3,000 crore) in solar power projects. India offers “one of the best solar resources and a sound government support for the development of solar sector. The country provides a good platform for Fortum to further develop its business in solar also elsewhere,” the company said.
