World's largest coal producer Coal India on Monday approved a proposal to buy back 108.95 million shares, spending a total of ₹3,650 crore. A buyback would be a 'better way' of rewarding shareholders and will be "positive for the stock", an analyst said. It will help the government, which owns 79.65% of Coal India’s shares, to raise resources, he added.
