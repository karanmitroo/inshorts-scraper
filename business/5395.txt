The board of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cleared a proposal to introduce banknotes of ₹200 denomination, according to multiple reports. The decision was reportedly taken at an RBI board meeting held in March. The process of printing the new ₹200 notes is likely to begin after June, once the government officially approves this new denomination, reports added.
