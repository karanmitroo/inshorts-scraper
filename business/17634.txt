The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, this week sued Visa Inc for $5 billion, accusing the credit and debit card network of excessively high card swipe fees. Wal-Mart contends that the way Visa set swipe fees violated antitrust regulations and generated $350 billion for card issuers over a 9-year period, in part at the expense of the retailer and customers.
