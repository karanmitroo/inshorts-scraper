US-based Saint Francis High School has made $24 million from Snapchat's IPO that took place on Thursday. The school invested $15,000 in Snapchat in 2012, which has since matured and received a significant boost after the company's IPO. The school made investment on the recommendation of Barry Eggers, Co-founder of VC firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, which also invested in Snapchat.
