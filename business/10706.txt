The RBI on Friday removed the seven-year-old restriction on fresh purchase of state-owned Punjab National Bank's shares by foreign investors. This followed the central bank reporting that aggregate foreign shareholdings in PNB have fallen below the prescribed threshold caution limit. Earlier, PNB had posted the largest quarterly loss by any public sector lender for the quarter ended March.
