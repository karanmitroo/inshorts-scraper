Following the passage of the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill on Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it is "perhaps the most important" tax reform, subsuming over a dozen central and state levies. Manufacturing taxes and VAT will come down, he said, adding that once GST is implemented it will "improve the base of taxation" and make evasion "extremely difficult".
