At an Asia-Pacific summit in Manila, Philippines, on Wednesday, US President Barack Obama asked Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Filipina entrepreneur Aisa Mijeno questions. Obama questioned Ma on how the latter thought young entrepreneurs could be helped by the government, to which Ma replied, "no tax". Obama also attempted to play "matchmaker" and suggested Ma to invest in Mijeno's company.
