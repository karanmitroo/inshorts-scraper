Former SoftBank President Nikesh Arora has sold all of his SoftBank shares to company’s Founder Masayoshi Son at a ‘minimal loss’, after he resigned from the company on Tuesday. Notably, Arora had borrowed heavily to buy $483 million worth of SoftBank’s shares last August, which was the biggest insider purchase in Japan in the last 12 years.
