US-based lender Wells Fargo awarded CEO Timothy Sloan $12.8 million (â‚¹84 crore) last year, a 17% increase, despite scrapping executive bonuses following a fake accounts scandal. The lender had been fined $190 million for a dispute over its sales practices. Notably, the bank was accused of setting 'unrealistic' goals that caused employees to cheat, including open 20 lakh bogus accounts.
