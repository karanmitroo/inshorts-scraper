In his first media interaction after resigning as Infosys CEO, Vishal Sikka said that in many ways it's a sad day, but it might help things. "I have no plans, I have no thought about what I'm going to do next," he added. Further, Infosys Co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan said the board fully understands Sikka's reasons for stepping down.
