The Income Tax department has got a new technology tool to check for duplicate Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards. The department earlier used to check for duplicity of PAN in a manual fashion, a senior official said. The system, upon finding a duplicate PAN, will direct the taxman to inform applicants to surrender the duplicate identity.
