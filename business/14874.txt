Biocon, a biopharmaceutical company, has decided to introduce biosimilar products in developed markets in the next three years. Biosimilars are copies of drugs with the same safety and efficacy as the original products. The company launched two biosimilar products in Mexico and Colombia this year and is looking at a revenue of around $200 million by 2018 through them.
