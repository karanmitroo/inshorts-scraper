Brandon Charles, a former employee of lending startup Social Finance, has filed a lawsuit alleging he was fired for reporting sexual harassment of female co-workers. The lawsuit claims Charles' manager used "explicit sexual innuendo" and made "lewd, sexualised gestures" when referring female staff. Charles claimed he was told that reporting this to supervisors was outside his "appropriate duties".
