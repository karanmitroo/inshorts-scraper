Congress leader and industrialist Naveen Jindal, accused in a coal block allocation scam case, was on Wednesday allowed by a special court to travel abroad for business purposes. Jindal was earlier granted bail by the court in the case and several conditions were imposed on him, including one prohibiting him from leaving the country without the court's nod.
