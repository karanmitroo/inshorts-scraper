Nestlé has launched the first nut-free version of one of its oldest brands 'Walnut Whip' in the UK. Nestle has said the new variant will cater to people who do not like nuts, but reportedly this comes after walnut prices in the UK rose 20% earlier this year. Notably, the new variant will be sold under the Nestlé Whip brand.
