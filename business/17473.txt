Bill Gates, who sold 20 million shares of Microsoft last week, is no longer the largest individual shareholder in the company. With almost 333 million shares, Steve Ballmer, who retired in Feb from its CEO position, has now eclipsed Gates (330 million). Interestingly, Gates, who owned 49% of Microsoft at its IPO in 1986, is now left with only 4%.
