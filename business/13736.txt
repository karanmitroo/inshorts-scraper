Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) reported a net loss of ₹617.94 crore for the quarter ended September, compared to a net profit of ₹441.83 crore in the year-ago period. “Exceptional losses impacted consolidated profit after tax... on account of impairment of overseas fixed assets (Australia) and foreign exchange variations attributable to sharp depreciation of Australian dollar,” JSPL said.
