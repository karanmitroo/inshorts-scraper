Slamming the Centre for merging the Union Budget and the Railway Budget, former Railway Minister Pawan Bansal has said that the move has "finished the importance of the Railways." He added that a separate Railway Budget allowed the Parliament to scrutinise the government's announcements. India's Union and Railway Budgets were merged after 92 years in 2017.
