A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court today issued a non-bailable warrant against Vijay Mallya in a â‚¹950-crore loan default case. In its chargesheet, the Enforcement Directorate said the loan was disbursed despite weak financials of the borrower. This is seen as a move to make India's case stronger for Mallya's extradition from the UK.
