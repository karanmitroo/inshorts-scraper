The Japanese division of lingerie maker Triumph International is recalling 22,000 brassieres after complaints that underwires suddenly poked out, sometimes while women were wearing them. Apologizing for the defect, the company said, "We are sorry for the bother, but we ask customers to stop using the bras immediately". There have been no reports of injuries from the defect so far.
