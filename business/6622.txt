Flipkart-owned payments app PhonePe, which completed a year of launch last week, hit out at ICICI Bank in a blog post for blocking its transactions on its platform since January 13. "First the 'bad' happened! Then the 'ugliness' started," PhonePe wrote in the post, saying that NPCI has no direct legal jurisdiction to 'direct' PhonePe or Flipkart to do anything.
