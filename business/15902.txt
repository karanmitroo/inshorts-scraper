Delhi industries minister Satyendra Jain said on Tuesday that the government has decided to do away with the requirement of consent from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and MCD trade license for small industries. DPCC officials stressed on their limited manpower and said requirements of these licences led to delay, harassment and increase in transaction cost in doing business.
