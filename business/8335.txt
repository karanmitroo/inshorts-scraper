Jindal Steel & Power Limited (JSPL) on Thursday said that it had missed its payment on interest, worth â‚¹15.43 crore, due last month on some bonds, making it the third lapse since September. The firm owed this to short-term cash flow mismatches and it said that the money will be paid in due course.
