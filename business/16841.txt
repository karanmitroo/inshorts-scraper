Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will launch an updated version of the Income Tax Department website, on Monday. The new version will be more user-friendly, as it will be a single window for all online services offered by the department. It will help users to file I-T returns, apply for a PAN card and get information and news on Income Tax.
