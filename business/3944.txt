Mike Ashley, founder of sports goods firm Sports Direct, once vomited in a pub fireplace at a company meeting after drinking 12 pints of lager with vodka chasers, according to court. Finance expert Jeffrey Blue, who is suing Ashley, said he regularly held meetings in pubs. "On one such evening...Ashley challenged a young Polish analyst...to a drinking competition," he added.
