Vijay Mallya on Thursday told the Supreme Court that he does not have enough money to pay the â‚¹9,000 crore he owes to banks in India. He stated that all his assets have been attached by the Enforcement Directorate. The court asked Mallya if he has honestly disclosed his assets, as he has been absconding since 2016 over loan non-payment.
