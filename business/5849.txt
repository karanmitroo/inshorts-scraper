SpiceJet has announced that it will reserve its fourth row on all flights for female passengers travelling alone, starting Wednesday on International Women's Day. In case the flight is full, women will be assigned aisle and middle seats as moving out of these is easier, the airline added. Meanwhile, Air India started seat reservation for solo women passengers in January.
