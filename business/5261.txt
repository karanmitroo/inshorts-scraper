The Maharashtra government has agreed to provide land at the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) for the first underground station of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. The train would start underground from BKC, travel 21 km in a tunnel passing through the sea, and emerge over the ground at Thane. It would have 12 stations, eight in Gujarat and remaining in Maharashtra.
