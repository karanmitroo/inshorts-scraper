Israel's national trade union staged a half-day strike on Sunday to protest generic drugmaker Teva's decision to lay off a quarter of its workforce. The strike closed Israel's main international airport, stock exchange, banks and all government ministries. Recently, Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, said it would cut 14,000 jobs worldwide, including 1,700 jobs in Israel.
