Pearson Plc on Thursday agreed to sell the Financial Times Group to Japanese news service Nikkei for a sum of $1.3 billion. The sale doesn’t include Pearson’s 50% stake in the Economist group and the Financial Times headquarters on London’s Southwark Bridge. The Japanese financial giant trumped German publisher Axel Springer, to end Pearson's 58-year ownership of the Financial Times.
