Infosys' Senior Vice President and Technology and Architecture head, Navin Budhiraja, has resigned over a month after Vishal Sikka stepped down as CEO. This makes him at least the 12th former SAP executive to have left Infosys since March 2016. Infosys denied making a statement saying, "We don't comment on exits or appointments other than those of key management personnel."
