The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced the implementation of its long due quota reforms which were passed in 2010, but only got the US Congress' approval last year. As a result of the reforms, four emerging market countries (Brazil, China, India, and Russia) will gain more voting rights and be among the ten largest members of the IMF.
