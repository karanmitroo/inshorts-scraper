More than 25 US companies, including airplane major Boeing and technology firm Oracle, have launched a coalition, dubbed the "American Made Coalition" to back a House Republican plan to tax all imports. The proposal would "support American jobs and American-made products," the firms claim. The coalition also includes pharmaceutical major Pfizer and General Electric, the companies confirmed.
