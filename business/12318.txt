UB Group chairman and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Mallya on Friday responded to the controversy over him leaving the country even as 17 PSU banks sought an order restraining him from travelling abroad. “I am an international businessman. I travel to and from India frequently. I did not flee from India and neither am I an absconder. Rubbish,” Mallya tweeted.
