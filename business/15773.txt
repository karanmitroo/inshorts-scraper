India's current account deficit (CAD) reached $8.2 billion (1.6% of GDP) in the October-December quarter of the current financial year from $10.1 billion in Q2. The reduction in the CAD in Q3 was primarily on account of increased net exports of services with improvements in net earnings through travel and software services, and lower net outflows under primary income.
