Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said that negotiation talks on restructuring the Greek bailout terms will resume after being frozen. This comes after Greece's government reaffirmed commitment to reforms demanded as part of its third bailout. Notably, the talks froze over Greece's demand of paying a Christmas bonus to 16 lakh pensioners and halting tax on the islands sheltering migrants.
