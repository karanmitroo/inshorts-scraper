The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has said that celebrities should be held liable for endorsing misleading advertisements. The Consumer Protection Bill, which is pending before Parliament, has provisions for a penalty and ban on celebrities endorsing misleading ads. CAIT has written to Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan saying the bill must be passed in the current Parliament session.
