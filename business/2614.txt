China is reportedly planning to ban trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on domestic exchanges, but plans to allow over-the-counter transactions. Following the reports, the price of Bitcoin fell $500 in the last two days to trade around $4,100. Notably, this comes after China recently banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), saying the practice constituted illegal fundraising.
