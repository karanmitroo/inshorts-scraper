Unions under the United Forum of Bank Unions have threatened to go on strike on February 28, which will mostly affect operations at public sector banks. Private banks will function normally but may see delays in cheque clearances. The demands include compensation of employees for extra work hours following demonetisation. Notably, UFBU claims membership of nearly 10 lakh bank staff.
