Former head of immigration of Infosys in the US, Erin Green, has filed a lawsuit against the IT giant, alleging discrimination against non-Asian employees and sought damages. Green also questioned the manner in which Infosys decided to fire him, and raised serious charges against two senior executives. Notably, Green joined Infosys in 2011 and was asked to leave last year.
