TMC leader Dinesh Trivedi has said that successive governments have "short changed" Air India by treating it like their private properties. Trivedi urged the government to reconsider its decision to privatise it. "As the government operates BSNL and MTNL in communications and Doordarshan and All India Radio in broadcasting, it should have a national carrier as well," he added.
