Over 200 Air India passengers have been stranded in Ankara, Turkey for over 24 hours because the aircraft cannot take off after making an 'overweight landing'. The London-Mumbai flight was forced to land due to a medical emergency. It requires clearance from engineers at the airport because it landed with an additional 20 tonnes of fuel instead of minimum weight.
