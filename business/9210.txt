Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry's share prices increased on Wednesday after the company said it will stop making smartphones and move into the software business. This comes after BlackBerry said they would stop making phones if they could not generate profit by September. CEO John Chen said the services and software revenue is expected to increase 30% in this fiscal year.
