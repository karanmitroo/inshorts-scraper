British carrier Monarch Airlines faced an annual loss in excess of $133 million (over â‚¹867 crore) when it went bust, CEO Andrew Swaffield has said. He said the collapse of Monarch was timed to avoid more disruption and could not have been averted because of Britain's insolvency laws. The failure of Monarch has affected nearly 9 lakh passengers in total.
