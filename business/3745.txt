China plans to cut off some funding for China's third richest man Wang Jianlinâ€™s Dalian Wanda Group, after concluding the conglomerate breached restrictions for overseas investments, reports said. Six investments, like the purchase of Carmike Cinemas, were found to have violations. The move is a setback for Jianlin, who has announced deals worth over $20 billion since 2016.
