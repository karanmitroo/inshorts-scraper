US-based aerospace startup Boom Technology has raised $10 million from Japan Airlines to build supersonic passenger jets. Japan Airlines has also agreed to purchase 20 aircrafts, the startup said in a blog post. Boom intends to build aircrafts that can fly 2.2 times the speed of sound (over 2,300 kmph) in comparison to nearly 1,050 kmph speed of conventional airplanes.
