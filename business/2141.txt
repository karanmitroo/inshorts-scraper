Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the goal of increasing the annual trade between the US and India to $500 billion is not a "distant dream". He said India offers opportunities to American companies, particularly in defence and aviation sectors. Notably, US' goods and services trade with India totalled an estimated $114.8 billion in 2016, with India running trade surplus.
