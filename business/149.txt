Craig Wright, who once claimed to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has been sued for $10 billion by the family of his former colleague Dave Kleiman. The lawsuit claims that Craig "perpetrated a scheme" to seize Bitcoins mined by Dave, who died in 2013. The duo allegedly controlled as many as 1.1 million Bitcoins at the time of Dave's death.
