World's top 30 steel companies' total debt stands at a record $150 billion, consultancy firm EY said on Thursday, adding, governments' action to support the sector would work with "radical" industry restructuring. This follows pressure from excess capacity, lower steel prices and weaker demand on major steel firms, EY stated. Notably, China's steel sector debt is estimated at $500 billion.
