China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has banned individuals and organisations from raising funds through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), saying the practice constituted illegal fundraising. Those who have raised funds via ICOs should make arrangements to return the funds, it said. Notably, ICOs have seen unchecked growth over the past year, raising as much as $1.6 billion.
