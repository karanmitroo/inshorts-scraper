Apple, which recently unveiled iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, could sell 100 million iPhones during the second half of 2014, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said, adding that the new releases are expected to do well particularly in China. After unveiling the new models, Apple had announced that over 4 million iPhones were sold during the first 24 hours of preorders.
