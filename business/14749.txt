Five Uber drivers were arrested in Hong Kong on Tuesday for allegedly operating without a hire car permit and driving without a proper insurance. The arrests came a few weeks after traditional taxi drivers protested against taxi hailing apps, accusing the latter of not getting legal permits. Two of Uberâ€™s offices were raided and three staff members were detained.
