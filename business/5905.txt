Benami properties are properties bought by an individual, not under his or her name. Any asset can be Benami if itâ€™s owned by one person but paid for by another, from unknown sources of income. Transactions involved in the same are called Benami transactions and are used to evade taxes as real owners of such properties are difficult to trace.
