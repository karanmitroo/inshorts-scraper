US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been sued for alleged insider trading of Bitcoin Cash by its employees. Coinbase made a surprise announcement on December 19, 2017, that it had started trading the cryptocurrency. The lawsuit alleges that employees were tipped off a month in advance allowing them to place orders and drive up the prices within minutes of the announcement.
