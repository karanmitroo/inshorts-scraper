SK Patra, former CEO of Patanjali Ayurved and President of Patanjali Food Park, said he left because Baba Ramdev asked him to offer free 'seva'. Patra said while Patanjali promised to pay for both his jobs, Ramdev would tell everyone, "Right now he's drawing salary, but soon he won't." However, Patra insisted on receiving salary for both the jobs.
