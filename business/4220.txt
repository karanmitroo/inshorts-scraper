Anti-nuclear activist SP Udayakumar, in a letter, has accused journalist Arnab Goswami's news venture Republic TV of deceiving and harassing him and his family. His complaint comes after Republic TV carried out a ‘sting operation’ against him, which the channel claims exposed his "willingness to accept money from abroad". The channel further claimed that the activist had “gone into hiding”.
