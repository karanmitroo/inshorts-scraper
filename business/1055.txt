The Centre has made it mandatory for e-commerce firms to display the maximum retail price (MRP) on goods from today. Amendments in this regard were made to the Legal Metrology (packaged commodities) Rules in June 2017. Along with MRP, the companies have to display manufacturing and expiry date, net quantity, country of origin and consumer care details on the label.
