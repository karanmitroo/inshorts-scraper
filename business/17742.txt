The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused the plea of Sahara Group chief Subrata Roy seeking exemption from personal appearance before it, in connection with the failure of his companies to refund Rs 20,000 to investors. Roy has not complied with its order (of refunding investorsâ€™ money) and that is why he is summoned to appear tomorrow, the apex court said.
