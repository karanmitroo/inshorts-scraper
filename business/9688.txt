Natural resources company Vedanta Resources on Tuesday said its shareholders have approved the merger with its oil subsidiary Cairn India Limited. However, the shareholders of Cairn are yet to approve the merger in an e-vote. The “risk averse” merger could make the joint entity India’s largest diversified natural resources company, Vedanta Group Chairman Anil Agarwal said.
