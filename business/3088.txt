The market valuation of e-commerce giant Amazon briefly dipped by $5.7 billion after US President Donald Trump tweeted against it on Wednesday. Trump's tweet came in the wake of many traditional retailers closing stores and blaming Amazon for a shift to buying goods online. Trump has often criticised Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.
