Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian has said that all tax laws and procedures should be devised to cater to the over 90% who comply. "We have learnt that while the costs of corruption are huge, so are the economic costs of going after corruption," Subramanian said. He added that one of the properties of GST is that it encourages self-compliance.
