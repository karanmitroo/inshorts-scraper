Expressing confidence about diesel price deregulation, Union Oil Minister Veerappa Moily on Friday said, "We still hope that in the days to come and within a couple of months, we are going to deregulate diesel prices completely". The government would have achieved complete deregulation of diesel earlier but couldn't because of the sharp currency depreciation during the year, he added.
