The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI), which tracks service sector companies on monthly basis, declined for the first time in 16 months to 46.7 in November. This was also the biggest one-month drop since November 2008, after the Lehman Brothers' collapse, which triggered the global financial crisis. This shows that firms were heavily impacted by demonetisation, analysts said.
