Italy's antitrust agency on Wednesday fined Unilever's Italian unit over €60 million (over ₹450 crore) for abusing its dominant position in the country's ice cream market. The authorities started probe after a smaller rival accused Unilever of forcing local retailers not to sell their popsicles. Unilever Italy said it rejects the conclusion of the Italian authorities and would appeal it.
