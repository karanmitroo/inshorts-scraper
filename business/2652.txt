Gold price plunged by ₹820 to ₹30,530 per ten gram on Saturday in the national capital, witnessing the biggest one-day fall this year. This came due to weak global cues and a drop in demand from local jewellers. Silver held steady at ₹42,000 per kg on scattered enquiries from industrial units and coin makers.
