Tobacco giant Philip Morris' marketing strategies of advertising at kiosks and free distribution in bars for youth, for its cigarette brand Marlboro, have violated India's legal norms, reports said. Tobacco-control officer SK Arora stated vendors were paid extra for such ads. Notably, a Facebook post in 2016 read, "We're searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for Marlboro pub activity...in Delhi."
