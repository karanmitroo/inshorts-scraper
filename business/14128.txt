Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) have invested around $8.05 billion in Indian debt this year, which is more than double of their $4.02 billion investment in local equities. “FIIs are looking at debt in India as real interest rates are higher than nominal interest rates in most parts of the world”, said managing director at Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund.
