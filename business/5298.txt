The Income Tax Department has slapped a fresh demand note of ₹10,247 crore on Cairn Energy. This comes days after Income Tax Appellate​ Tribunal (ITAT) held that Cairn Energy was liable to pay tax on the 2006 transfer of India assets to newly created Cairn India, prior to listing. Cairn Energy had sold Cairn India to Vedanta in 2011.
