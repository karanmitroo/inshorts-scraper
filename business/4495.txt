About 450 workers at Tata Motors' Sanand factory decided to boycott canteen meals offered by the company, demanding higher compensation in the first year of long-term settlement of wages. The workers claimed they had been negotiating with the management for 18 months. Since there was little progress for their demand, the workers resorted to this 'symbolic form of protest'.
