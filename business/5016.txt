Businessman Raj Kundra has said that his wife Shilpa Shetty's name has been dragged in a cheating case to create media hype. "We have tight contracts signed and on the contrary, the vendor owes us money for not fulfilling orders," added Kundra. He further explained that Shilpa has nothing to do with the daily running of the business.
