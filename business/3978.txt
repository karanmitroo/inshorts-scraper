Restrictions on cash dealings of ₹2 lakh or more will not apply to credit card bill payments, the Revenue Department has clarified on Monday. Earlier, the government banned cash transaction of ₹2 lakh or above with effect from April 1, 2017. The move was aimed at curbing black money by discouraging cash transactions and promoting digital economy.
