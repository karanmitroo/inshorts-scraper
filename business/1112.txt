Air Deccan Chairman GR Gopinath has referred to Vijay Mallya as a "political football", who borrowed money when UPA was in power. Without naming, Gopinath claimed that one party was disgruntled that Mallya was allowed to leave India, while the other blamed the former for not taking adequate action. "Both parties politically find him too close for comfort," he added.
