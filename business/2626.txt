Reliance Jio, in a letter to TRAI, said Airtel is creating a 'smokescreen to hide its ill-gotten profits' under the existing Interconnection Usage Charge (IUC) regime. Earlier, Jio said India's top three telcos generated up to ₹1.04 lakh crore in revenue in the last five years in excess IUC. In reply, Airtel claimed it incurred a loss of ₹6,800 crore.
