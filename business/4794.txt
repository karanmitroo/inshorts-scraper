The Competition Commission has ordered a probe against major telcos for allegedly trying to block the entry of Reliance Jio, reports said. The regulator's decision comes after a complaint filed against Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, and Cellular Operators Association of India. The watchdog reportedly has concluded that dominant telcos used the platform of COAI to deny interconnection points to Jio.
