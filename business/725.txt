The European Union's anti-trust regulator has fined Qualcomm $1.2 billion for paying Apple to not use rival manufacturers' LTE chips in its iPhones and iPads. "This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were," the regulator said. It added that the penalty represents 4.9% of Qualcomm's turnover in 2017.
