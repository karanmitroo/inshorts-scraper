Former World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu on Sunday said while GST was good economics, PM Narendra Modi's decision to demonetise high denomination currency notes is not. It's complex and the collateral damage is likely to far outstrip the benefits, Basu said. Notably, the government has demonetised ₹1000 and ₹500 notes as a measure against black money and fake currency.
