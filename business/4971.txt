A Delta Airlines pilot slapped a woman who was fighting with another passenger, as he tried to break up a fight between them. The incident occurred when passengers were de-boarding a flight and two women got into a physical altercation. The pilot was suspended but later returned to duty as Delta felt he had acted in accordance with the law.
