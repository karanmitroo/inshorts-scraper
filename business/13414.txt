The BSE Sensex on Tuesday gained 170.09 points to close at 25,320.44 while the NSE Nifty rose 50.85 points to settle at 7,700.90. Analysts attributed the gains to buying of blue chip stocks in the afternoon session, ahead of the US Federal Reserveâ€™s meeting and recovery in European markets riding on gains in French companies.
