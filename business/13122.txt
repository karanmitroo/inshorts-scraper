Adani Power, India's largest private sector power producer, plans to invest an estimated ₹11,500 crore in Udupi Power Corporation (UPCL) to expand its capacity to 2,800 MW from the present 1,200 MW. Adani had acquired UPCL from Lanco Infratech early last year at an enterprise valuation of ₹6,300 crore in one of the biggest deals in the power sector.
