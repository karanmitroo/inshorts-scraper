A parliamentary panel has recommended fixing an upper limit on airline fares depending on the sector. The panel has also accused airline companies of not passing on the reduction in jet fuel prices to customers. Further, it has also proposed that airlines not be allowed to charge more than 50% of the base fare on cancellation.
