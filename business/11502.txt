The government has relaxed FDI norms for asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), allowing 100% FDI through the automatic route, as per Budget announcements. Earlier, 49% investment was permitted through automatic route while investors had to obtain government approval to increase their stake in ARCs to over 49%. ARCs reconstruct assets and liabilities of other firms to make them saleable.
