To provide low-cost Internet connectivity to passengers, Malaysia's budget airline AirAsia has launched, a two month-long, free user trial of on board WiFi service. It’ll be available for up to 60 passengers, on a first-come first-serve basis, on selected flights until October. However, the airline hasn’t given details of the sectors, on which WiFi would be available.
