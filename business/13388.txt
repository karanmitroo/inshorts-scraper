The government on Friday lowered its GDP growth projection for 2015-16 to 7-7.5%, from the previously forecasted 8.1-8.5%, citing lower agricultural output triggered by a monsoon deficit as the primary reason. The Mid-Year Economic Review added that while retail inflation is likely to stay within the targeted 6%, keeping fiscal deficit under the targeted 3.9% of GDP would be challenging.
