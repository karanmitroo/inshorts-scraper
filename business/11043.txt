The government on Friday said it has constituted a committee to make recommendations on pay scale revision of executives in PSUs. The panel's suggestions will be submitted within six months of its constitution, and the government's decision on them will take effect from January 1, 2017. The last pay revision for the executives came into effect in 2007.
