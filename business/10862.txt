The British Pound has dropped to a 31-year-low of 1.35 against the US Dollar with voting on the Brexit referendum leaning towards Britain ‘leaving’ the European Union. This comes less than 24 hours after the Pound rose to its highest value of $1.50 in 2016. Notably, the drop in the British currency marks its biggest intra-day fall in history.
