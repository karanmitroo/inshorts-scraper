Union Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has dismissed mobile service providers' comments that call rates will increase due to the high bids for spectrum. He said that there was no reason to increase call rates and these “campaigns” should stop. “Tariff impact after the auctions will not be more than 1.3 paise per minute for users,” he added.
