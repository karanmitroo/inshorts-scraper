Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to violate safety regulations, leading to a mine blast that killed 29 workers in 2010. However, he was found innocent of lying to regulators and investors after the tragedy. Blankenship is believed to be the first CEO of a US giant to be convicted of safety-related charges.
