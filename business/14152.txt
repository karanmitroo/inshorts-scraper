Chinese mobile phone maker Vivo will reportedly replace PepsiCo as the title sponsor of IPL T20 tournament. PepsiCo, however, will continue its association with independent IPL teams as their beverage partner. The company, that apparently does not want to be linked to a controversy-ridden sport, had replaced DLF as IPLâ€™s title sponsor in 2013.
