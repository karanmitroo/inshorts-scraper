Responding to a question on whether Air India stake sale would be open for FDI, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said, "I think Indian mindset is not inclined towards that but theoretically everything is open." "Indian mindset is that this is a national carrier," he stated. Notably, current FDI policy doesn't permit foreign airlines to invest in Air India.
