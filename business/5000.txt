A US court has ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $20 million (â‚¹129 crore) to a woman who suffered injuries from an implanted vaginal mesh device. The 56-year-old woman had alleged the product failed to work as advertised, caused her chronic pain, and necessitated multiple corrective surgeries. The woman added that the device caused "sharp stabbing pains" and bladder problems.
