Swedish furniture maker IKEA has recalled about 17.3 million chests and dressers after the death of an eighth child. The two-year-old boy was killed in California in May after he got trapped beneath an unanchored 3-drawer chest that tipped over. IKEA has received 186 reports of tip-over incidents involving the dressers, including 91 reports of injuries to children.
