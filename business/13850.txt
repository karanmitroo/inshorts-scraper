Nissan Motor Co on Saturday announced it will discontinue fitting Japanese auto parts supplier Takata's airbag inflators in its cars. The inflators contain ammonium nitrate and have, in the past, exploded under pressure to spray shrapnel in the cars. This has led to eight deaths and over 100 injuries worldwide. Carmakers Toyota and Honda have also discontinued using Takata's airbags.
