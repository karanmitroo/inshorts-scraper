The government has said there will be no special treatment for Vodafone and Idea, which have decided to merge and the companies will have to comply with existing norms on spectrum, subscriber, and revenue caps. "After consolidation, there will still be 5-6 players in each service area. So, cartelisation is not possible," Union Minister Manoj Sinha has said.
