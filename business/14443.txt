The government on Thursday decided to amend the Income-Tax act retrospectively to exempt Foreign companies that do not have a permanent establishment (PE) in India from paying Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) on profits from April 2001. The amendment will be applicable for companies, irrespective of whether they reside in countries which have a Double-Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India.
