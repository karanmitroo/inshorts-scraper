A London court has ordered Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion in damages to Japan's NTT Docomo for breaching an agreement. Docomo claimed Tata Sons had failed to find a suitable buyer for Docomo's 26.5% stake in Tata Teleservices under an agreement signed between them. The court further asked Tata to designate a buyer for Docomo's stake in Tata Teleservices.
