Sahara chief Subrata Roy's lawyer Thursday told the Supreme court that the company could not deposit the Rs 10,000 crore as surety for bail. This means Roy will have to stay in jail till the next hearing on Apr-3. On Wednesday, the apex court had said that Roy could be released on bail the moment he paid Rs 10,000 crore.
