BlackRock executive Belinda Boa has said that Bitcoin's valuations are "extreme" and "bubble-like". "BlackRock's view is that this isn't a financial asset like we would trade in terms of equities and fixed-income instruments," she said. She added that as the cryptocurrency's valuations go higher in the future, there is likely to be more volatility in its price.
