Taxi-hailing app Uber is reportedly planning to raise another $1 billion in funding at a valuation of $60-70 billion. This round comes just a few months after it closed a funding of $1 billion. After this raise, it will become the most valuable private startup in the world. Uber recently said that it is not planning to go public soon.
