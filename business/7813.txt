The Reserve Bank of India has proposed opening “Islamic window” in conventional banks for “gradual” introduction of Sharia-compliant banking in India. “Initially, a few simple products... similar to conventional banking products may be considered for introduction through Islamic window," RBI said. Islamic banking is based on principles of not charging interest, which is prohibited under Islam.
