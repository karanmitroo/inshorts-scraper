Mitsubishi Motors on Tuesday admitted that it falsified the fuel consumption test several times on its cars since 1991. The company’s announcement comes after last week’s revelation that it deliberately manipulated fuel economy tests for four of its car models sold in Japan. The number of models affected was not yet known, said vice-president Ryugo Nakao.
