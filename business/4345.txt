The merger between Flipkart and eBay India has been approved by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Earlier this year, eBay had invested $500 million into Flipkart and sold its India business to the company to pick up a stake in it. The CCI's approval is necessary for the formal completion of any acquisition and merger deals in the country.
