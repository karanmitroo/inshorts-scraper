Snapchat Founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy's net worth has dropped by $1 billion each to $4.9 billion after Snapchat's parent company Snap's shares fell 18%. Spiegel, 26, and Murphy, 28, are among the world's only four self-made billionaires aged under 30. Snap, which went for IPO on March 2, is now more valuable than Ferrari and hotels chain Hilton.
