The pound on Tuesday dipped around 0.6% to $1.276 in early trading, hitting its lowest level since June 1985. The currency traded around 15% weaker than before the 'Brexit' vote. The pound earlier hit a three-year low against the euro. This came after UK Prime Minister Theresa May set a March deadline for exiting the European Union.
