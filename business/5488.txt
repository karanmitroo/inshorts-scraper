Gap CEO Jeff Kirwan has responded to a five-year-old girl's letter, who asked the clothing giant to expand the girls' section beyond "princess" themes, or consider eliminating gendered kids clothing sections. Kirwan emailed the girl, saying, "You are right." Gap was earlier criticised for its campaign featuring boys' ads with slogans like "little scholar" and girls' ads with "social butterfly".
