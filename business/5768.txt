The Chinese Embassy in Berlin has asked a German company Spreadshirt to apologise for T-shirts carrying "eat a Chinese" slogans. Spreadshirt was slammed for the T-shirts which had slogans like "Save a dog, eat a Chinese" and “Save a shark, eat a Chinese”. The slogans were reportedly meant to encourage customers to eat Chinese food, instead of dogs and sharks.
