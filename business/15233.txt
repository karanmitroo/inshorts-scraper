Greece's cash-strapped government has delayed the 300 million euro repayment of an IMF loan scheduled for June 5, saying it will bundle all four of its payments due in June together. Greece now has until June 30 to repay the International Monetary Fund 1.5 billion euros, the same day its bailout deal with the European Union and IMF runs out.
