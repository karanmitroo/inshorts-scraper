Tax incentives allowed 15,080 profit-making Indian companies to have effective tax rates of zero or even less than zero in 2015-16, an IndiaSpend analysis revealed. Additionally, larger corporations paid lower tax rates than smaller ones during the period. Effective tax rate is the rate actually paid by companies on profits, calculated as tax actually paid divided by profits before tax.
