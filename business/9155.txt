Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank's shares tanked over 8% in intra-day trade on Friday, causing its share price to slip below the â‚¬10 mark for the first time in around 30 years. The bank is facing a possible $14 billion penalty from US authorities. This has dragged the entire banking sector down with Italian lenders at the bottom, analysts said.
