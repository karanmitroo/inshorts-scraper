An Independent Director on the boards of three Tata group companies, Nusli Wadia has filed a ₹3,000 crore defamation suit against Ratan Tata and Tata Sons' board of directors. After Chairman Cyrus Mistry's exit from Tata, the group is also seeking Wadia's ouster. While Tata alleged Wadia's actions harmed the group, Wadia termed the allegations “false, defamatory, baseless and libellous.”
