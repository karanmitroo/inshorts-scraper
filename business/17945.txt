The price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) was hiked by Rs 220 per bottle on Wednesday on firming international rates. The 14.2-kg cooking gas cylinder, which customers buy after consuming their quota of subsidised cylinders, will now cost Rs 1,241 in Delhi, state-owned fuel retailers said. This is the third increase in non-subsidised LPG rates in the past month.
