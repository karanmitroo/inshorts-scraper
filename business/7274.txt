Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Friday said that political parties depositing old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes in their accounts will be exempt from income tax. If the amount is deposited in an individual's account then "that information will come into our radar", he stated. Notably, the I-T Act grants exemption from tax to political parties in respect of their income.
