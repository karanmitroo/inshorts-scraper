Bharti Airtel on Tuesday hit back at Reliance Jio for its allegations around the former's fastest network ad campaign, saying that the complaint is a deliberate attempt to “malign the brand” and “misguide customers”. Further, mobile internet speed testing firm Ookla has stood by the finding that Airtel had fastest broadband network, a claim which has been challenged by Jio.
