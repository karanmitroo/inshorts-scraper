South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai Motor has fired its America CEO Dave Zuchowski with immediate effect. While the company did not mention the reason for Zuchowski's departure, reports claim that he was sacked over missing the company's internal sales goals. Zuchowski, who earlier worked with Ford and later Mazda, took over as Hyundai's America CEO in 2014.
