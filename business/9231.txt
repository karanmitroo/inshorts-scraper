Software services firm Infosys has stopped the remaining instalments of the promised â‚¹17.38-crore severance package to its ex-Chief Financial Officer Rajiv Bansal, reportedly after some of the company's founders questioned the move. Notably, none of the Infosys founders is on the board or in any executive position. Earlier, Infosys said it had paid 2 of the 10 instalments to Bansal.
