The Royal Canadian Mint has unveiled a specially designed two-dollar coin, or 'toonie', which it claims is the world’s first glow-in-the-dark coin to enter circulation. The coin features two people paddling under the Northern Lights. The coin, created to mark the 150th anniversary of Canada’s confederation, is also the world’s first coloured bimetallic coin.
