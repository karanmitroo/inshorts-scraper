US-based Firestar Diamond Inc, controlled by PNB fraud accused jeweller Nirav Modi, filed for bankruptcy on Monday, along with its affiliates A Jaffe Inc and Fantasy Inc. Listing up to $100 million in assets and debt, Firestar blamed liquidity and supply chain challenges for bankruptcy after the nearly $2 billion fraud. Notably, Firestar is not named in PNB's fraud complaint.
