L&T Shipbuilding is expecting orders worth around ₹9,000 crore over the next three years, Chief Executive B Kannan said. With the government opening the defence sector to private players, the company also expects to earn revenue worth ₹3,000 crore during the period. Notably, the Cabinet had cleared the ₹4,000-crore 10-year policy to boost commercial shipbuilding in December 2015.
