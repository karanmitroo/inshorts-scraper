Energy firm Royal Dutch Shell will exit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to reportedly increase cost reduction amid weak oil prices. The move includes the sale of 10% of the company's oil and gas assets. Shell is currently active in more than 70 countries and said it would focus on US, Brazil, and Australia, among others.
