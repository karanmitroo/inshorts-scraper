E-commerce giant Amazon is planning to launch Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video (AIV) services in India by the end of 2015. While AIV is an Internet video on demand service, Amazon Prime is its premium subscription setup. Amazon, which turned 20 last week, has completed two years in India, where its business is now worth at least $2 billion.
