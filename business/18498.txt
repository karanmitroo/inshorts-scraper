Don Mattrick(49), the head of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox business who replaced Zynga Inc. founder Mark Pincus as CEO this week, will get a hefty, largely stock-based compensation package of about $50-million in coming years. Zynga, which has suffered 66% loss in its IPO of $10 in late 2011, is counting on Mattrick to turn around its struggling phase.
