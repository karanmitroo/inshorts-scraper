A fake message being circulated on WhatsApp claims that if people split their shopping bills at supermarket chain D-Mart, they can avoid GST. The message says that no GST will be levied on bills below â‚¹1,000, while the tax will increase as the amount increases. However, D-Mart issued a clarification saying GST is levied on products, not on bill amount.
