Japan's economy loses $138 billion (â‚¹9.2 lakh crore) a year, about 2.9% of GDP, due to lack of sleep, according to a study. Japan doesn't have laws governing minimum rest periods and one has to work long hours, analysts said. Increasing sleep from under six hours to up to seven could add $75.7 billion to Japanese economy, the report added.
