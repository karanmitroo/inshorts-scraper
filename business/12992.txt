RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Wednesday that once the markets stabilise, people will invest in emerging markets like India. Calling the rupee "relatively strong" in the emerging markets currency basket he said India is facing the same problems as other world markets. His comments come amid the recent stock market plunge and the rupee reaching lowest-ever levels.
