Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday hinted that the growth rate in 2015-2016 could reach an excess of eight percent. "Our fiscal deficit figures are under control. Inflation is very much under control," Jaitley said. He also allayed fears over Monday's stock market crash, saying that it was due to external and not domestic factors.
