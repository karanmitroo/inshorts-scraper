Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Kalraj Mishra on Sunday said that the setting up of MSMEs is necessary for the 'Make in India' campaign and for India's overall progress. The government's 'Zero Defect, Zero Effect’ policy has gained "attention and importance" and its implementation can help the manufacturing sector "thrive" in the country, Mishra added.
