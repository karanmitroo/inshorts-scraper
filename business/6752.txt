Chinese President Xi Jinping, while cautioning against protectionism, told the World Economic Forum, "No one is a winner in a trade war.” “Protectionism is like locking yourself in a dark room, which would seem to escape wind and rain, but also block out the sunshine,” he said. He urged world’s elite to address globalisation problems without turning from economic trends.
