Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra is recalling around 23k units of a select variant of its popular sports utility vehicle Scorpio to rectify faulty pressure regulating valves. The company said it would carry out preventive inspection of some parts of its Scorpio Ex variant manufactured between May-2012 and Nov-2013. In December last year, the company had undertaken a similar exercise.
