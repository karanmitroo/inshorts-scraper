The All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC) is protesting against RBI's decision to keep banks open on all holidays till April 1 to facilitate tax collection. "There are four working days between March 25-31, which is more than enough," the union said. It further stated the bank employees won't be able to celebrate Navaratri, Ugadi, Gudi Padwa and other festivals.
