India's largest lender SBI has cut its workforce by 6,622 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, driven by natural attrition such as retirements and voluntary retirement scheme. The lender has seen a staff reduction to around 2.73 lakh during the period. This comes amid concerns that active digitisation in the banking sector will slow down hiring of workforce.
