PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said that India will no longer “resort to retrospective taxation” while also not imposing “minimum alternate tax on foreign portfolio investors”. "There were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting the sentiments of foreign investors… We want to make sure our tax regime is transparent and predictable,” Modi added.
