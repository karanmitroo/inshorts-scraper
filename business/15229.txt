Indian designer Nirav Modi’s high-value diamond necklace was recently sold for Rs 13 crore at a Christie’s auction in Hong Kong. It took Modi 2 years to develop the trademarked Ainra cut, with pearl shaped diamonds weighing 10.02 and 2.66 carats. The Gemological Institute of America has termed the 10.02 carat diamond as the world's most sought-after diamond.
