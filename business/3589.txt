Tanzania government sent gold producer Acacia Mining a $40 billion tax bill and another $150 billion in interest and penalties. The bill is equal to almost two centuries worth of the company's revenue. The government alleged the company under-declared export revenues between 2000 and 2017. The company's disagreements with authorities has resulted in 57% decline in its stock this year.
