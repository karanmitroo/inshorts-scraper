Samsung Co-CEO Jong-Kyun Shin on Thursday apologised for the Galaxy Note 7 debacle which dragged the company's profits to a two-year low. "We know we must work hard to earn back your trust and we are committed to doing just that," he said at the general meeting following the announcement of Samsung's quarterly result in South Korea.
