AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes says the worst negative reception he has had to face in any South East Asian market that his airline has entered, was in India. "I found the reaction of the airline industry quite hostile and quite counterproductive, something I have never experienced before," said Fernandes. Notably, AirAsia began operations in India last month.
