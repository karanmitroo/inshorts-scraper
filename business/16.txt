'The Wolf of Wall Street' producer Red Granite Pictures has agreed to pay $60 million to settle US government claims that it financed the film with money misappropriated from Malaysian state fund 1MDB. The settlement by the company, co-founded by Malaysian Prime Minister's stepson Riza Aziz, also covers forfeiture claims against the rights and interests in two other movies.
