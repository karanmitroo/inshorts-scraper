Jim Wong, President of the world's fourth-biggest PC maker company ACER, said that the company would return to profit this year after write-downs and poor demand pushed it into losses in 2012. According to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll, analysts forecast that Acer will swing to a net profit of $57 million in 2013 from $97 million loss in 2012.
