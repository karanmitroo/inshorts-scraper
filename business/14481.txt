Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, at the Asia Pacific Investors Cooperation India summit in Hong Kong on Monday, said that the economic growth of India is set to outperform last year's 7.3%, and won't be affected by China's slowdown. He added that India stands benefitted by China's laggard growth, which has weakened the oil and commodity prices.
