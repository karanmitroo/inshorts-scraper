The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which maps the service sector activity, returned to growth in February after posting a contraction for three straight months. The index rose to 50.3 as against 48.7 in January. The expansion came as businesses recovered from the demonetisation-led disruptions seen in the previous three months.
