RBI Governor Urjit Patel has asked his colleagues to “zealously guard the integrity and reputation of our organisation” and emphasised that “any act belittling the same should deserve zero tolerance from all of us”. Earlier, RBI employees, while commenting on demonetisation, had said that the government “is impinging on the RBI’s autonomy and its statutory as well as operational jurisdiction”.
