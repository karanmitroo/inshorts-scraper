Phelon Davis, a former bank teller at Wells Fargo's Georgetown branch, stole more than $185,000 (â‚¹1.2 crore) from a homeless customer. Davis devised a scheme to steal money when the customer went to deposit a garbage bag full of cash. He used the stolen cash for the down payment on his home, to pay off debts, and fund several vacations.
