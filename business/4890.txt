Billionaire Warren Buffett has called Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos "the most remarkable business person of our age." Buffett was talking about Bezos' ability to grow Amazon's retailing and cloud computing divisions both into multi-billion dollar businesses. "To succeed in two different big businesses in a huge way, I can't think of another example like it," Buffett said.
