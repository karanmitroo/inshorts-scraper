Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha on Friday said the country would have 8 to 10 “very competitive” state-owned banks after an ongoing consolidation phase, a sharp reduction from the 27 currently in existence. “Some of them are going to be large-scale global players. Some of them are going to be differentiated banks,” he said.
