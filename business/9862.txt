American aircraft maker Boeing on Monday said that it will not raise its jetliner prices for the first time since 2009 and will continue to quote July 2015 base prices in 2016. This comes after the firm booked 335 new orders till August 23, much fewer than the 418 jetliners ordered in the first seven months of the previous year.
