Ma Huateng, Chairman of Chinese internet giant Tencent, became the country's richest man after overtaking e-commerce major Alibaba's Founder Jack Ma on Monday. This marked the first time he ranked at the top in China. A 2.95% gain in share price of Tencent added nearly $1 billion to Ma Huateng's fortune, which stood at an estimated $36.2 billion.
