Technology giant Google may buy Taiwanese electronics company HTC's smartphone business, according to reports. Google is planning to "either become a strategic partner, or outright buy the entire smartphone unit," reports said. However, HTC's virtual reality business is unlikely to be a part of the deal. Earlier this week, HTC posted its lowest monthly revenue in over a decade.
