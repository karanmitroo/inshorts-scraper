India's per capita beer consumption last year was 4.6 litres, which is around 92% less compared with the Asia average of 57 litres, according to global industry analysis firm BMI Research. India ranks among the lowest globally in beer consumption because regulatory restrictions like licensing and high taxes limited expansion opportunities for multinational brewers, BMI said.
