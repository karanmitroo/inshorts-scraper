Telecom equipment maker Ericsson on Monday announced that it signed a patent license deal with Apple but, did not elaborate on the details of the agreement. Ericsson had filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker in January over technology license payments. Apple reportedly would have had to pay 2-6 billion Swedish crowns annually if it lost the patent license case.
