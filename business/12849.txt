Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu on Saturday said that his ministry is investing billions of dollars to modernise the sector and give a push to the ‘Make in India’ initiative, which is a “marathon” and not a “sprint”. 'Make in India' “is a mission and not a slogan. We are working on it,” he added, while disclosing the Railways' investment plans.
