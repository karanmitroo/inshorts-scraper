India's electronic goods imports for 2014-15 stood at ₹2.25 lakh crore against ₹1.95 lakh crore in 2013-14, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Indian electronic goods production value was ₹1.8 lakh crore and ₹1.9 lakh crore for 2013-14 and 2014-15 respectively, thereby suggesting that the indigenous production is not sufficient to meet the local demand, Prasad added.
