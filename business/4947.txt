United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz has told a congressional committee that the incident of a passenger being dragged off a flight was a "mistake of epic proportions". The passenger was treated in a way that no customer, or individual, should be treated, he added. Munoz further called the incident a "terrible experience" that should never be repeated.
