Rating agency Moody's said Thursday that a growth rate of over 7.5 percent might not be "sustainable" for India and the country needed to settle tax issues. However, it added that the country's outlook was better than its peers. "What is positive for India is political willingness to take a longer term reform measures," Moody's vice president Atsi Seth said.
