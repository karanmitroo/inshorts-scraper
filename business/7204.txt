Television journalist and former Editor-in-Chief of Times Now Arnab Goswami has said his new venture 'Republic' would change the “perspective” of journalism. “The people who rejoiced when I left will eat their words now, because I am coming back with Republic,” he said. As long as he remains in the journalism profession, he won't “let down” people’s faith, Goswami added.
