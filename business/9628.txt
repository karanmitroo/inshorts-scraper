President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday signed the Goods and Services Tax Bill (GST), making the bill a law. The Constitutional Amendment bill proposing the indirect tax regime was already approved by the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and over 16 State Assemblies. Under GST, taxes previously imposed by the Centre and States will be replaced with a common nation-wide taxation system.
