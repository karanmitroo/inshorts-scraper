Nestle India Ltd, which makes Maggi noodles, claimed on Monday that it had conducted tests on more than 1,000 batches and found them safe. “Internal and external tests show that lead levels are well within the limits specified by food regulations,” the company said in a statement. The company, however, maintained a silence on levels of MSG in the noodles.
