The Supreme Court has asked Sahara to submit a fresh plan for raising funds against its properties following the collapse of negotiations with US-based Mirach last week. Sahara was in funding talks with Mirach Capital that would have involved refinancing the conglomerate's overseas hotels. Sahara is struggling to raise money to secure release of its jailed chief, Subrata Roy.
