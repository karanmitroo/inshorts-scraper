The city council of Portland, US has voted to pass a first-of-its-kind measure to levy tax on public companies whose CEOs earn significantly more than employees. Firms will see a 10% increase in tax if CEOs make 100 times the average employee and a 25% increase if they earn 250 times the average. The tax seeks to address income inequality.
