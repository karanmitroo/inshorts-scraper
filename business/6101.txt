TRAI is examining BSNL's app-based calling service following a complaint by Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI). "We have asked them for certain clarifications to understand the service," said TRAI Chairperson RS Sharma. COAI alleged the new service was being marketed as "distinct", despite being "in-principle same version of the FMT services" launched last year but later withdrawn.
