In a significant step, the Reserve Bank of India has relaxed the "fair value" buyout norm for Tata, easing the buyout of its Japanese partner DoCoMo's stake in their telecom joint-venture. Tata Group can pay DoCoMo a previously agreed price of Rs 58.045 a share, for the latter's 26% stake in Tata Teleservices, instead of a much lower "fair value".
