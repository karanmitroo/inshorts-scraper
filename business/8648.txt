Saudi Arabia has hiked its visa fee by 650% to do business, which could deter foreign investment required for its oil-dependent economy, diplomats said. A six-month work-visit visa allowing multiple entries will now cost 3,000 riyals ($800), as against 400 riyals ($106.6) before. The hike aims to cover Saudi's loss in oil revenue, which slumped 68% over five years.
