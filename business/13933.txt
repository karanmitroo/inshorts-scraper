Ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service on Monday changed its outlook for India's banking system from 'negative’ to 'stable'. “The stable outlook... over the next 12-18 months reflects our expectation that the banks’ gradually improving operating environment will result in a slower pace of additions to problem loans, leading to more stable impaired loan ratios,” Moody’s' vice-president said.
