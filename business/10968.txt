Insurance regulatory body IRDA on Wednesday issued draft guidelines for the public listing (IPO) of insurance firms. Currently, no insurance firm in India is publicly listed. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had earlier proposed the listing of four state-owned general insurance firms. Further, private players like HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential had earlier announced their plans of going public.
