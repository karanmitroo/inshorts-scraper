British Airways is expected to face a bill exceeding £100 million (nearly ₹830 crore) in compensation, additional customer care and lost business after a global IT outage affected over 1,000 flights over the weekend. It faces bills for delays, while passengers are also entitled to meals and refunds. BA will reunite passengers with their luggage via a free courier service.
