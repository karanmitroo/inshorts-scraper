The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Civil Aviation Policy, under which the 5/20 rule will be replaced by 0/20 rule. Airlines would be allowed to fly abroad only if they have 20 aircraft, but there would be no restriction on the number of years of operation. Earlier, airlines had to wait for five years to have an international flying permit.
