After his sudden exit as Infosys MD and CEO, Vishal Sikka is now likely to join IT giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), according to reports. Sikka, on Thursday, stepped down from Infosys entirely with immediate effect, after Nilekani's entry. He had joined Infosys three-years ago from German software maker SAP, where he was the CTO.
