The government on Wednesday said directors or authorised signatories of deregistered companies who try to siphon off money from the shell firms' bank accounts will face up to 10 years in jail. This comes after 2 lakh companies were struck off the records over inactivity. The government said it is trying to find the "actual beneficiaries" behind such entities.
