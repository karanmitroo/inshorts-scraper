The Central Information Commission has directed a banks' consortium that lent a bad loan to Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines to reveal details about not just the loan, but also about the loan's approval. Banks earlier rejected an RTI petition, refusing to give most of the information about the process that led to "unwarranted" granting of loan that eventually went bad.
