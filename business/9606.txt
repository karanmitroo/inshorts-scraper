According to a regulatory filing, Yahoo Japan in February proposed a "merger of equals" with Yahoo before Verizon acquired Yahoo's core assets for over $4.8 billion in July. The deal would have given the company's shareholders 50% of the combined entity and about $14 billion in cash. The deal was rejected because its terms did not seem "compelling" to Yahoo.
