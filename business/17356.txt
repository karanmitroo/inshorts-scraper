The NSE Nifty on Thursday closed 23.50 points higher at a fresh record close of 7,276.40, surpassing the previous record of 7,275.50 made on May-20. The broader sentiment got a leg-up after Reuters reported that the finance ministry was working on a proposal for the new government to cut welfare spending and rein in fiscal deficit to 3.8-3.9% of GDP.
