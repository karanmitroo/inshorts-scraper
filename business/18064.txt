Sahara Group on Tuesday said it would submit new title deeds for properties worth Rs 20,000 crore to the SEBI, which had termed assets offered earlier as highly over-valued. The fresh proposal follows after the Supreme Court last week restrained Sahara group from selling any properties. The court will hear the matter next on December 11.
