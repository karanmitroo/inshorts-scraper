Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Tuesday said that his new telecom venture Jio is not a gamble but a well thought-out and well-engineered business. “It is no punt... It is a ₹2.5 lakh crore investment,” Ambani stated. Furthermore, Ambani compared the interconnectivity dispute between Jio and incumbent telecom operators as similar to a meritorious student “getting ragged”.
