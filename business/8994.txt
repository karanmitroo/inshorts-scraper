A US appeals court on Friday reinstated a 2014 verdict which had ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million to Apple for breaching patents. Apple’s lawsuit had contended that Samsung infringed upon patents for 'slide to unlock' and autocorrection features, among others. Samsung failed to prove that these features were “obvious” and thus not able to be patented, the court ruled.
