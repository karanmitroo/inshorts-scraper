Russia's energy Minister Aleksandr Novak called the $6.6 billion (â‚¹44,500 crore) fine imposed by a Ukrainian court on Russian natural gas company, Gazprom, an "illegal decision". The fine was imposed on Gazprom for alleged abuse of its monopoly in the natural gas market. Relations between the two Soviet countries has been strained since 2015 after Russia annexed the Crimean Penninsula.
