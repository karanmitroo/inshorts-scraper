India retained its position as the world's largest remittance recipient in 2015, receiving about $69 billion, the World Bank said on Wednesday. However, with a fall from $70 billion in 2014, this is the first decline in India's annual remittances since 2009. China, with $64 billion in remittances, was second on the list, followed by Philippines ($28 billion).
