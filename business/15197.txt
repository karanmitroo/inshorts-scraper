Germany’s largest lender, Deutsche Bank, on Sunday appointed Briton John Cryan as its CEO to replace Anshu Jain just two weeks after the latter was given more power to reorganise the bank. Bryan had been on the bank’s supervisory board since 2013 and was the ex-CFO of rival bank UBS. He will replace Jain as he resigns on June 30.
