Over 72 days post demonetisation, the RBI has said that it still doesn't know the ‘exact number’ of demonetised currency notes that were in circulation. The RBI is still “reconciling” the number of notes that were deposited back, reports have said. Earlier, reports had said that old notes worth ₹15.44 lakh crore were in circulation on November 8.
