The Indian Banks' Association has said there is no proposal to discontinue free banking services and asked people not to pay heed to 'baseless rumours'. This comes after reports that public sector banks will cease free services from January 20. However, the industry body said that banks will continue to review their transaction charges based on operational and commercial viabilities.
