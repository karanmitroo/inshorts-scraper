The dollar index, a measure of the value of a dollar compared to a host of other currencies hit a record high of 95.516 on Tuesday, a figure untouched since September 2003. The benchmark 10-year treasury bond yield rose to 2.1% from last week's low of 1.93% to push the dollar up, supported by healthy inflation rates and consumption indices.
