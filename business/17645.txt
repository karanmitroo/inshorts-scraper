The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the government to file a report on the steps it had taken for an investigation into the alleged Rs 6,500 crore investment in four Reliance Industries Ltd companies. In 2011, the Indian High Commission in Singapore had asked for a probe in the investment made by Biometrix Marketing and Strasbourg Holdings in RIL.
