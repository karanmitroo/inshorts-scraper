The Modi government has decided to release commemorative coins to honor Tata Group founder Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, to mark his 175th birth anniversary. This is the first time that coins will be minted for an industrialist. The move will boost PM Narendra Modi's "Make in India" campaign. The coin-release ceremony will be on January 6, at the PM's residence.
