Tata Sons has stated that Interim Chairman Ratan Tata never attended any board meeting since 2013 to ‘allow Cyrus Mistry the freedom to operate’. This comes after ousted Tata Sons Chairman Mistry alleged that he was not given "autonomy" during his four-year term. The statement further claimed that Ratan Tata had retired and hence, it was ‘unfair’ to target him.
