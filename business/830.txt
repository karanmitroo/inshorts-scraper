Saudi Arabia's King Salman has ordered deposit of $2 billion into Yemen's central bank to support the country's national currency rial. This comes a day after the Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr publicly appealed for funds to save the local currency. "Saving the rial means saving Yemenis from inevitable hunger," the PM said on Wednesday.
