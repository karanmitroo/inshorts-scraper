The US dollar reached a 12-year high against the euro on Friday, with 1.05 dollar being equivalent to one euro, due to heavy buying. The rise in the dollar's value caused apprehensions about its impact on the earnings of US-based multinational companies, leading to a fall in stocks. The S&P 500 declined for the third consecutive week.
