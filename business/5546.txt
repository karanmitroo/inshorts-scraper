Ice-cream makers Vadilal and Pabrai’s Fresh & Naturelle are joining Hindustan Unilever, which owns the Kwality Wall’s brand, in its case against Amul's latest ice-cream TV commercial. HUL has sought removal of Amul's ad, stating that it is misleading and makes factually incorrect statements. Notably, Amul's ad says, "Eat real ice-cream and not vanaspati-based frozen desserts."
