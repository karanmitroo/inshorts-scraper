The Finance Ministry is reportedly looking to increase the earlier announced capital infusion of ₹70,000 crore into PSU banks over the next four years to meet their financial requirement. The announcement regarding this may be made in the 2016-17 Union Budget. Notably, the PSU banks have an additional ₹1.1 lakh crore capital requirement to meet the global risk norms.
