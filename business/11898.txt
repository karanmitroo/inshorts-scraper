The wholesale price of onion has plunged to 30 paise per kg in Madhya Pradesh's Neemuch district after a bumper harvest and low demand. “[O]nly a few days ago it commanded a price of ₹15-20 per kg,” a farmer said. This comes after onion prices surpassed ₹60 per kg last year due to shortage following crop damage from heavy rainfall.
