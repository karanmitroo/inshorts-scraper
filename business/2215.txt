A manager at a McDonald's outlet in New York was arrested earlier this week after he was caught serving customers cocaine with Happy Meals. Frank Guerrero, 26, was caught red-handed by authorities after a three-month long undercover investigation, termed as "Operation Off the Menu". Guerrero allegedly stuffed drugs inside the bathroom's soap dispenser until clients arrived to purchase them.
