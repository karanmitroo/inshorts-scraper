World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu on Saturday said that there could be revisions in the bank’s “January review of India’s growth forecast”. “[T]he fact that a couple of important decisions did not go through (in the Parliament’s winter session) could have an impact,” Basu added. Until October, the World Bank maintained India’s GDP growth forecast at 7.5% for 2015-16.
