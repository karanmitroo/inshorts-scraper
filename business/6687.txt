Finance Minister Arun Jaitley took part in the 'Halwa' ceremony on Thursday, which marks the printing of documents for the forthcoming Budget. As a ritual, ‘halwa’ is prepared in a big ‘kadhai’ (frying pot) and served to the ministry's entire staff. Over 100 officials will now stay in Budget printing press till Jaitley’s budget speech on February 1 gets over.
