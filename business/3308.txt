Bank employee unions have called for a nation-wide strike on August 22, which will see participation of nearly 10 lakh employees, to protest against privatisation of public sector banks, and their merger and consolidation. Some of the other demands by the unions include not to write off bad loans, and to declare wilful default of bank loans as criminal offence.
