The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority announced that upper age limit for joining National Pension Scheme (NPS) has been raised to 65 years, from the current 60. This aims to open up pensions to sectors without pensions. Currently, only 15-16% of employees in India are covered by pensions because around 85% of the workforce is in the unorganised sector.
