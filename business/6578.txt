Yoga guru Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved's spokesperson has said that the company will never sponsor cricket as it is not an Indian sport. The spokesperson added that Patanjali will be associated only with Indian sports and events built on Indian culture, and the events where Ramdev himself participates in. Patanjali had sponsored season two of Pro Wrestling League.
