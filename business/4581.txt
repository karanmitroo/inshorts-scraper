United Spirits plans to sell 13 properties earlier owned by former Chairman Vijay Mallya who has failed to buy these back within an agreed deadline. United Spirits said it received call notices from a party nominated by Mallya to purchase four non-core properties, but these notices have expired due to inaction. Notably, Mallya owes over â‚¹9,000 crore to various banks.
