While ATMs will be operational from Friday, it will take another 10 days for the situation to normalise, SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said. This is because there are nearly two lakh ATMs and only three-four vendors to reconfigure them, she added. Further, some ATMs dispense only â‚¹100 notes, and need to be reconfigured to dispense other denominations, she stated.
