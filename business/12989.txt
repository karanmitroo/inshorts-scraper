Tech giant Apple India Ltd on Wednesday sought permission from the Indian government to open single-brand retail stores in India and also sell its products online. This comes after the government allowed single-brand retailers with foreign investments to sell products online last year. Notably, Apple opened its retail stores last year in partnership with Tata-owned electronics chain Croma.
