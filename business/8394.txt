The government on Saturday issued an order for the implementation of the recommendations of the seventh Central Pay Commission for the revision of pension of pre-2016 defence forces pensioners. For these pensioners, the revised pension with effect from January 1 shall be determined by multiplying the basic pension/basic family pension, as drawn on December 31, by 2.57.
