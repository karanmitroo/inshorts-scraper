The Income Tax department on Thursday activated the e-filing facility for all categories of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2017-18. The new ITRs have been made available for filing on the e-portal of the department. The government had launched all ITRs on March 31 including the one-page simplified ITR-1 (Sahaj) for salaried class.
