United Airlines on Tuesday won a false imprisonment lawsuit by a frequent flier who was arrested by London police after refusing to leave a United lounge. The flier said the staff demanded that she leave despite rebooking a missed flight. The court said United did not falsely imprison her and had no duty to help her rebook the club lounge.
