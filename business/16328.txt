President Pranab Mukherjee Friday signed the ordinances on insurance and coal, paving the way for additional foreign investment in insurance as well as re-allocation of cancelled coal mines. The President has signed the two ordinances, press secretary Venu Rajamony said. The Cabinet had promulgated the ordinances after the bills could not get passed in the winter session of Parliament.
