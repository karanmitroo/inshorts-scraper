A US cafe The End has claimed that Starbucks stole the idea of a unicorn-themed beverage from them. The End started selling its Unicorn Latte in December and has had a trademark on the drink name pending since January, while Starbucks launched the Unicorn Frappuccino in April as a limited-run item. The cafe is seeking compensation and a public apology.
