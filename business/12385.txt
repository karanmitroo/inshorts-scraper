The RBI on Thursday released draft guidelines for setting up non-banking financial companies. NBFCs would act as account aggregators and provide customers with a consolidated view of their financial holdings across banking, insurance, mutual funds, provident funds and shares in a common format. Such a platform is presently not available, especially for holdings under different regulators' purview.
