The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Tuesday that London-based drugmaker AstraZeneca will pay $5.52 million to resolve a bribery probe. The case pertains to improper payments by the firm's staff to state-employed healthcare officials in China and Russia. AstraZeneca had also falsely recorded these payments in China and Russia as bona fide business expenses, the SEC said.
