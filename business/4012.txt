The Delhi High Court on Monday directed SpiceJet to deposit ₹250 crore in cash and ₹329 crore as bank guarantee with the court, providing interim relief to Kalanithi Maran. A previous order asked SpiceJet to pay ₹579 crore to Maran and his KAL Airways. This came as the court asked both firms to begin arbitration in a share transfer dispute.
