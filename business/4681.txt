Deutsche Bank, which is on trial for allegedly helping Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena conceal losses, is facing accusations that it was running an international criminal organisation at the time. Deutsche Bank is accused of using complex derivative trades to hide losses at the Italian lender, leading to a misrepresentation of its finances between 2008 and 2012.
