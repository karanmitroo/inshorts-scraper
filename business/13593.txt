The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Thursday called the recent liberalisation of FDI norms an “absolute jugglery of words... to provide backdoor entry" to MNCs in India. CAIT added that the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion’s (DIPP) press note extends the definition of 'manufacturing' to assemblers and re-packers, which violates the ‘Make in India’ initiative's objectives.
