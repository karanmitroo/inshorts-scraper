Automobile manufacturer Maruti Suzuki expects to sell 4,000 to 5,000 units of its maiden crossover SUV, the S-Cross, every month. Priced between Rs 8.8 lakh and Rs 14.5 lakh, the all diesel car comes in seven variants. However, the company said it had no plans to roll out a petrol variant or an automatic transmission model.
