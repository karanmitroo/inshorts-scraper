Saudi-based Ahmad Hamad Al Gosaibi & Brothers (AHAB) has signed a deal with a creditor banks' committee to restructure about $6 billion of debt, amid attempts to end a seven-year halt on Middle East’s biggest default. In 2009, AHAB and billionaire Maan al-Sanea’s Saad Group had defaulted on about $15.7 billion following the global economic crisis and asset price slump.
