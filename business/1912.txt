Kotak Life's #LaterMaybeLate campaign wants to create awareness among people to avoid procrastination in securing the future of their loved ones. It has released a video that portrays a near-death experience and urges people to act now by taking life insurance and not let an emergency rule their decisions because 'Later' could turn out to be 'Late'.
