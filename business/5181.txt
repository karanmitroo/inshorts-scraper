Times Group has sent journalist Arnab Goswami's new venture Republic TV a notice over the use of the phrase "Nation wants to know". Goswami said, "The notice threatens me with imprisonment if I ever use the phrase. They say they own the phrase". He added he has been using the phrase for the last 20 years throughout his reporting career.
