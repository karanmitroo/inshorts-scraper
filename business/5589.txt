News Corporation Founder Rupert Murdoch has reportedly reached an agreement with blood-testing startup Theranos to sell $125 million worth of shares back to the startup for $1. The move will potentially allow the billionaire to write off the investment in Theranos as a loss and save tax. Theranos is currently facing criminal investigations for misleading investors and regulators.
