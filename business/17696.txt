The directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) has slapped a notice to Samsung for evading duties to the tune of Rs 72 crore by declaring tablets as mobile phones while importing a consignment of Rs 464 crore. The company allegedly did so as import duty on tablets was much higher at 12% as compared to mobile phones at merely 1%.
