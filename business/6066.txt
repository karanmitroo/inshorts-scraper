Vodafone India on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court that it was aggrieved by the free voice services being provided by Reliance Jio. Vodafone alleged that by providing free voice calls as a promotional offer beyond a period of 90 days, Jio was violating TRAI tariff orders. It said it was also aggrieved by TRAI allowing the violation to continue.
