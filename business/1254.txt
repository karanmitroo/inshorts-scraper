GST Council member Sushil Modi has said the council will consider bringing electricity, real-estate, stamp duty and petroleum products under GST in future. He said if petroleum products are brought under the GST regime, it will attract the highest tax slab prevalent at that time. He said the current highest tax slab of 28% may be brought down to 25%.
