Twitter’s Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has announced that he will transfer one-third of his stock, or 1% of the company, to the employee equity pool to "reinvest directly into people". This is reportedly worth $197 million as of July 28. Dorsey tweeted, "I'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small”.
