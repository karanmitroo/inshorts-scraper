A panel of top bureaucrats has recommended PM Narendra Modi to make public broadcasters Doordarshan and All India Radio corporate entities. This would reduce their dependence on government funds and give them flexibility in decision-making, like BBC, the panel said. The panel also recommended reviewing the existence of Prasar Bharati, which runs AIR and Doordarshan.
