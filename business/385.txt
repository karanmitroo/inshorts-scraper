US President Donald Trump has slammed India for high import tariffs on high-end motorcycles and threatened to impose a 'reciprocal tax' on motorcycles imported from India. He added that the recent decision of India to reduce the customs duty from 75% to 50% was not enough. At present, US does not levy any tariff on Indian motorcycle imports.
