US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn on Tuesday resigned amid reports of differences over stiff tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Trump had announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports to protect US manufacturers.  "Gary is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service," Trump said.
