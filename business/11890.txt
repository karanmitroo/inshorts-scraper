The Delhi government has banned the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of all forms of chewable tobacco including gutkha and pan masala for one year. The ban is also applicable to unpackaged tobacco products and components of gutkha that "easily facilitate mixing by the consumer". This comes after the Supreme Court directed the government to ban gutkha in Delhi.
