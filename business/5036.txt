Private sector lender Axis Bank on Wednesday said that its net profit for the fourth quarter dropped by 43.13% to ₹1,225 crore, as against the year-ago period. The drop came amid flat net interest income and a rise in provisions for stressed loans. Notably, the bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose more than two times against the year-ago period.
