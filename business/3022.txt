Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy in a letter said the Infosys board's refusal to disclose information about the investigations related to the company's Panaya acquisition, is an "ultimate insult to shareholder democracy". "I never ever imagined that governance levels would stoop down to such a low level in a company that was the most respected company till 2014," he added.
