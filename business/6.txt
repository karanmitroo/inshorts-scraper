Nirav Modi's Firestar Diamond has moved Delhi HC against the seizure of its properties by Enforcement Directorate (ED). It has challenged provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) that allowed ED to conduct search and seizure. Firestar claimed the searches were conducted without following due process by not giving a copy of the search warrant to company officials.
