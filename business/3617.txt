The apex consumer commission has asked Unitech to refund over â‚¹49 lakh to a homebuyer for delay in delivering possession of his property. A buyer cannot be expected to wait indefinitely, it said. The commission also held Unitech guilty of deficient service and unfair practice as even after receiving over 100% of consideration amount, it failed to deliver the possession.
