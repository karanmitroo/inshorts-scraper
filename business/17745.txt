Revolutionary air-powered hybrid car by Peugeot will hit the market next year. The system combines a gasoline engine with an air engine which enables it to run on petrol or air or both. Expensive batteries would no longer be needed and drivers never run the risk of running out of compressed air  as the car ensures it replenishes itself automatically.
