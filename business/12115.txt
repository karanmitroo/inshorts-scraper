Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday urged the chief ministers of all states to oppose the proposed 1% excise duty on non-silver jewellery. "I wrote to Prime minister a few days back seeking roll back of excise on jewellers. Today, I wrote letters to all chief ministers urging them also to write to PM," Kejriwal tweeted.
