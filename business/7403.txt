Japanese construction company Kongo Gumi is considered the world's oldest surviving business, operating for over 1,400 years before it was absorbed as a subsidiary of another larger construction company in 2006. Founded in 578 AD, Kongo Gumi was a builder of Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and castles. The business was run by 40 generations of the Kongo family.
