The European Union (EU) on Tuesday blacklisted 17 tax havens, following investigations targetting nations not doing enough to tackle off-shore tax evasion. The blacklisted nations include South Korea, the UAE, and Panama, among others. The bloc named 47 other nations, which do not comply with EU standards but have committed to change their tax rules, in a "grey list".
