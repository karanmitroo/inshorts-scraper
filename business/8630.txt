Bio-pharmaceutical company Biocon on Friday said it expects to see its first set of biosimilar products to hit the European markets by early 2018. The company, in partnership with Mylan NV, is developing four biosimilars for regulated markets such as Europe and the US. A biosimilar is a drug that has active properties similar to the original biological product.
