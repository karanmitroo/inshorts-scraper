Former Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog Arvind Panagariya said, "India as a place to do business is a lot more attractive than the World Bank ranking suggests." He said investors usually go where the environment is best and not where the World Bank collects its data. He added, "reaching into the top 50 looks a lot more within our grasp."
