The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) Secretary Aruna Sundararajan has said that the department wants customers to rate their network provider and then 'name and shame' them for poor service. She said DoT plans to introduce a ranking system for telecom operators to tackle the problem of dropped calls. She added telecom operators can't give excuses for rise in call drops.
