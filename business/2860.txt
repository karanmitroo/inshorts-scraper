Billionaire Michael Bloomberg's Bloomberg Philanthropies is being investigated by Indian government over its funding to local non-profit groups for anti-tobacco lobbying. Home Ministry raised concerns that the foundation was running a campaign to "target" Indian tobacco businesses and "aggressively" lobby against the sector. It said such campaign has "adverse economic impact" on 3.5 crore people.
