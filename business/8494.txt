A US judge on Tuesday approved Volkswagen's $14.7 billion (over â‚¹98,000 crore) settlement with the federal and California regulators, and vehicle owners over its diesel emissions cheating scandal. The German automaker said it would begin buying back polluting cars in mid-November. Owners will get the pre-scandal "trade-in" value of the vehicle and $5,100 to $10,000 in additional compensation.
