Competition Comission of India on Friday ordered a probe against Swedish telecom giant Ericsson for allegedly violating the competition norms in India. The company was found charging two different licence fees per phone for use of the same technology. Also, royalty rates were linked to the final price of the product rather than to the functionality of the patent.
