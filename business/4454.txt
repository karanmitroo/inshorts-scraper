Oil marketing companies will extend the new pricing mechanism for fuel across India from June 16. Under the new system, companies won't wait for 15 days to adjust prices, and instead change them everyday based on crude price movements. This will move India to an international fuel pricing standard and prevent losses due to crude movements over a 15-day period.
