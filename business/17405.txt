Dallas-based AT&T is buying DirecTV for a whopping $49 billion, at a rate of $95 per share. The move gives the company a larger base of video subscribers and increases its ability to compete against Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which agreed to a merger in Feb. The companies expect the deal to close within 12 months.
