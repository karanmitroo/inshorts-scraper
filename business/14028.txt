India Infrastructure Finance (IIFCL), Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) and NTPC are planning to issue rupee-denominated bonds overseas next year, with the RBI issuing final guidelines for the same. With this, the foreign companies can raise cheaper capital and reduce the burden of hedging against currency fluctuations. NTPC and IIFCL reportedly plan to raise $500 million through these bonds.
