In one of the biggest layoffs in India, Larsen & Toubro fired 14,000 employees across businesses in the past six months, the conglomerate's CFO R Shankar Raman said. The firings were made due to factors such as change in technology, automation, redundancy and performance. L&T has been facing a slowdown in investments as its entities are struggling to repay debt.
