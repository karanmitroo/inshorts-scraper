Asian Development Bank (ADB) president Takehiko Nakao has been re-elected for a five-year second term by the bank's board of governors, on Friday. Nakao was first elected in 2013 to serve his predecessor Haruhiko Kuroda's three-and-half-years remaining term. Nakako was the only person to be nominated for the top post at the multilateral funding agency.
