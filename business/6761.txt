Payments app PhonePe's Co-founder and CEO Sameer Nigam on Saturday alleged that ICICI Bank was blocking transactions through its platform since Friday. This is at least the second instance of a commercial bank allegedly blocking an e-wallet service to protect its own services. PhonePe is a Unified Payment Interface (UPI) based e-wallet service under RBI's National Payments Corporation of India.
