RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said that India should set up a monetary policy committee (MPC), adding that he was "working hard" to get it in place before his three-year term ends in September. The committee would lead to more institutionalised decision-making on interest rates and stabilise expectations about inflation in the future, Rajan further said.
