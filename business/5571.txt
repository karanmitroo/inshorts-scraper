Dutch brewer Heineken has rejected accusations from Hungary that its red star is a communist symbol, stating brewers have used the logo since Middle-Ages. "[T]he red Heineken star has no political meaning whatsoever, and we use the same brand symbols across the world," it said. Notably, Hungary wants to outlaw symbols like the Nazi swastika or the communist red star.
