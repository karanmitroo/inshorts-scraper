Telecom operator Airtel said it has so far given over 17,000 interconnection points, sufficient to serve 7.5 crore customers, to Reliance Jio 'well ahead of the timeframe'. However, Jio claimed that Airtel was providing only one-way points, thereby violating licence norms. Over 280 crore calls have failed between Jio and Airtel over last three and a half months, Jio added.
