The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has asked the Indian Railways to revisit passenger tariffs to reduce losses in its core operations. Railways had managed to retain 2.8% of the profit earned in the freight services after subsidising for losses in the passenger segment in 2013-14, compared to a 21.66% retention in 2012-13, the CAG observed.
