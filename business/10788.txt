RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, while addressing the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, has suggested a longer term for the central bank's head. He reportedly said that the current three-year term is "short", citing the US Federal Reserve's example, where the chairman and vice-chairman serve a four-year tenure. Rajan, whose term ends in September, has already refused a second term.
