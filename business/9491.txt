Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said that although banks would prefer more funds for their recapitalisation needs, there are budgetary constraints in doing so. Jaitley has set about $10.5 billion in bank capital injections in the four years to March 2019. Notably, state-run banks have been saddled with $120 billion worth of bad loans.
