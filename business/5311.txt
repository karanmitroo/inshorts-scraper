Contrary to the belief that large sums must be invested in Mutual Funds to earn meaningful returns, people can start investing as little as ₹500 per month and gradually increasing the investment as income rises. For example, by investing ₹500 a month for 20 years at an annual return rate of 6%, investors can make ₹2.32 lakh at maturity.
