Nestlé's Poland Spring Water unit duped US consumers into paying premium prices for ordinary ground water, rather than water from natural springs as the company advertises, according to a lawsuit. While Poland Springs says its water bottles contain "100% natural spring water", the complaint claims Nestlé bottled well water. The suit, which includes claims for fraud, also seeks unspecified damages.
