Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra has said that the government needs to incentivise buying electric vehicles in order to bring down their cost and push sales. Incentives could be in the form of reduction in taxes or subsidies in insurance, he added. He said that due to very high battery cost, there is still reluctance to purchase electric cars.
