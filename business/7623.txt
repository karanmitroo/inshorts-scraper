Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said that he would have resigned from the post of Finance Minister if the Prime Minister insisted on demonetisation. "Had the Prime Minister told me 'I have decided to declare as illegal tenders ₹1,000 and ₹500 currency notes', my advice to him would have been not to do it," he said.
