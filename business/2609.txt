The Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted its ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR "for the time being". The court also directed Delhi Police to reduce the number of temporary licenses by 50% of those granted last year and cap it at 500. The bench said the order might require a review after Diwali, depending on the air quality.
