A 3-foot-long rabbit, which was expected to become the world's biggest rabbit but died on United Airlines' flight, was accidentally shut in a freezer by staff, reports said. An airport worker has revealed the pet was placed in temperatures of 0-2 degree celsius by mistake. The rabbit then reportedly froze to death after being left in there for 16 hours.
