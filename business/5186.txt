Ant Financial has raised its offer for electronic payment firm MoneyGram by 36% as the financial-services company controlled by billionaire Jack Ma tries to top a competing offer by Euronet Worldwide. With this, the transaction is now valued at around $1.2 billion, a statement by Ant said. A successful deal would be Ant's first big step to expand business overseas.
