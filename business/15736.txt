Snapchat's chief operating officer Emily White resigned on Friday - just a few days after the company bagged $200-million funding from Alibaba Group. White's stint in the firm lasted for just over a year. She is the third senior-level executive, after sales chief Mike Randall and human resources overseer Sara Sperling, to quit the startup in the last two months.
