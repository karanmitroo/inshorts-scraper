S&P on Monday raised the credit rating of Ukraine to B- from selective default after the war-torn country reached an agreement with international creditors for debt restructuring. “We view the risk of another default in the next two to three years as diminished due to the Ukrainian authorities’ commitment to the reforms set out in the IMF program", S&P said.
