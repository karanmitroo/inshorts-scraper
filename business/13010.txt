China witnessed an economic growth of 6.9% in 2015, its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. The country's GDP for December quarter stood at 6.8%, it's weakest quarterly growth since 2009. This comes at a time when China's government wants to move towards an economy driven by consumption and services, rather than one led by exports and investments.
