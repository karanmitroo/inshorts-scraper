Anil Ambani-led Reliance Energy on Tuesday terminated its contract for Rs 36,000 Cr Power Project (3,960 MW) in Jharkhand citing excessive delay in land clearances. It was required to handover 17,000 acre land clearances by Feb 2010, but there has been a delay of over 5-years by the state government required for power plant, captive coal blocks and related infrastructure.
