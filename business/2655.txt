McDonald's estranged partner Vikram Bakshi has claimed that 126 outlets in north and east India, run by Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), continue to operate fully. Apart from 43 outlets, which were closed in June after expiry of eating house licenses, the remaining are open, he noted. Earlier, McDonald's said it was taking action to enforce cancellation of CPRL's franchise licence.
