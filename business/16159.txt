A government announcement Friday said petrol price had been cut by Rs 2.42 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.25 per litre. Minutes before the announcement, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2/litre each. Thus, retail pump rates will remain unchanged as the increase in excise duty neutralises the cut in petrol and diesel prices.
