In an unexpected move, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan kept India's policy interest rate on hold on Wednesday. It was widely speculated that RBI will lift it's lending rate, but contrarily, it opted to keep the country's key lending rate  unchanged at 7.75%. The RBI had raised interest rates by 0.25% at its previous reviews in September and October.
