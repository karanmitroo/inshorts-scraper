Vodafone has moved the Delhi High Court alleging that telecom regulator TRAI failed to prohibit “blatant violation” of its tariff regulations by Reliance Jio by permitting it to continue its free offer. Vodafone further claimed that TRAI failed to implement the Telecom Department's circulars, which state that all tariffs must be non-discriminatory and non-predatory.
