Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out over ₹2,300 crore from Indian stock markets in the first week of December after US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reinforced the likelihood of a rate hike later this month. This comes after a sell-off of ₹7,074 crore-worth equities in November, prior to which FPIs had invested ₹6,650 crore in stock markets in October.
