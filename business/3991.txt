Netherlands' third-largest bank ABN AMRO said it will no longer extend credit to clients in the tobacco industry. The Amsterdam-based bank's decision came as it announced a new partnership with the Heart Foundation in its fight against smoking. Existing contracts with tobacco industry clients will be respected but won't be renewed and no new contracts will be signed, it stated.
