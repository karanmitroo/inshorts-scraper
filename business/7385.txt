The Venezuelan government on Friday seized nearly 40 lakh toys from a private company and promised to distribute the toys as Christmas gifts for poor children. The company, Kreisel, was accused of hoarding toys and hiking prices in the run-up to Christmas. Two company officials were also arrested on suspicion of promoting price speculation.
