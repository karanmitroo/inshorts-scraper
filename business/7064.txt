A multi-story car park in Hong Kong, which has been valued at around $2.2 billion (around ₹15,000 crore) by real estate firm Colliers International, is set to be sold by next year. The Hong Kong government's announcement marks the first sale of commercial land in the city’s central business district in over 20 years, which could boost property demand.
