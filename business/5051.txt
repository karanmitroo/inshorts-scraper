Benchmark index NSE Nifty closed above the 9,300-mark for the first time ever on Tuesday, following positive global cues. The sentiment was also boosted by optimistic quarterly results, including that of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries. Notably, Reliance rose 3.6% to its highest level since May 2008 in intraday trade, making it the biggest gainer on the NSE index.
