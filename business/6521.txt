In response to US President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order on immigration, Google has set up a $4 million fund, its largest ever humanitarian fund to date. The money will be donated to four organisations working to help the immigrants and refugees. While half of the fund money is coming directly from Google, another half will be coming from its employees.
