The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday charged two Initial Coin Offering (ICO) operators, REcoin and DRC World, with fraud. In a statement, the SEC accused the owner of the companies Maksim Zaslavskiy of selling unregistered securities and coins that don't exist to investors. Zaslavskiy allegedly told the investors they could expect "sizeable returns" from each operation.
