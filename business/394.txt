The Chairman of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, Shin Dong-bin, has been sentenced to 30 months in jail for bribery. He was found guilty of paying $6.5 million to a close friend of ex-President Park Geun-hye, in exchange for government favours. Samsung heir Lee Kun-hee was jailed last year in a related trial but was released last week on appeal.
