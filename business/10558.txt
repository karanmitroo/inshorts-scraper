According to US-based Moody's Investors Service, the government's fund infusion into public sector banks (PSBs) will offer "some respite", but their capital needs are "significantly higher". The rating agency estimates that the 11-rated PSBs need ₹1.2 lakh crore, which exceeds the ₹45,000 crore budgeted for disbursal by 2019. Earlier this week, the Centre had released ₹22,915 crore for 13 PSBs.
