Global financial ratings agency Fitch on Thursday said that while Indian banks are stable, “there will be challenges”. State-owned banks reportedly need ₹2.40 lakh crore by 2018 to meet global Basel III norms while pursuing "sustainable growth rates and cushioning balance-sheet stress”. Basel III norms are a global regulatory framework for strengthening banks’ stability by increasing liquidity.
