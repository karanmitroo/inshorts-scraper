Fast food giant McDonald's closed some restaurants across US on Thursday as part of a nationwide "Day Without Immigrants" protest. The protest, which was intended to show how US relies on immigrants in its workforce, impacted the fast food chain's employee count. Further, businesses including Starbucks, Taco Bell, and Burger King also shut down in some locations amid the protest.
