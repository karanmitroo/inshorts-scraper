The Reserve Bank of India on Monday denied that it has initiated any action to cancel the banking licence of Axis Bank. The private lender had earlier slammed reports stating that authorities were preparing to revoke its licence as "false and malafide". This came after a local daily suggested that Axis bank could lose its licence over money laundering activities.
