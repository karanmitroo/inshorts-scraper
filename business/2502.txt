A recent survey has revealed that around 30% people do not pay service charge levied by restaurants after the government termed the charge voluntary, asking people only to pay it if satisfied by the service. It further revealed that the 30% included 21% respondents who weren't asked for the charge, and 9% who got it removed from the bill.
