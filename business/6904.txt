State-run carrier Air India has said it will keep restrainers like plastic handcuffs on-board all its domestic and international flights to control unruly and disruptive passengers, a report said. "All our aircraft will have two pairs of restraining devices," Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani said. The move comes after recent incidents of indecent behaviour on-board Air India flights.
