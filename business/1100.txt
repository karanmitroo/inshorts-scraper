Markets regulator SEBI has ordered Axis Bank to investigate a suspected leak of financial information through WhatsApp after an initial investigation showed the leakage was due to "inadequacy" of processes at the bank. Axis Bank said it would work with SEBI to investigate the matter and take action as needed. Axis Bank has to complete the inquiry within three months.
