The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has introduced a common form to let people make different types of money withdrawals from their PF account. Fund subscribers will no longer require filing documents like marriage invitation cards for taking advances. The forms, besides the ones for advances and withdrawals, have been replaced with a single page Composite Claim Form (Aadhaar).
