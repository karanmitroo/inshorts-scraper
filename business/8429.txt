The Delhi High Court has rejected a plea filed by Tata Sons against allowing auctioning of the Taj Mansingh hotel. The court denied Indian Hotels' (IHCL) plea to extend the lease on the property. IHCL had challenged an order that permitted the hotel's auction as the Tata Group company was not entitled to an extension to run it.
