Goldman Sachs on Friday won a legal dispute with Libyaâ€™s sovereign wealth fund as a court ruled that the US-based firm did not dupe Libyan officials into investments that led to losses worth $1.2 billion. The Libyan Investment Authority had alleged Goldman Sachs used lavish meals and prostitutes to win the fund's trust to sign deals that it didn't understand.
