The Service Tax department has decided to re-auction Vijay Mallya's personal jet on November 28-29, in order to recover dues of around ₹535 crore. The department is opting for auction of the plane for the third time after it failed to find a buyer twice in the past. “We are trying to get potential buyers globally," a department official said.
