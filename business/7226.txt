BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has said the decision to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes was taken in 2014. “The government had decided to go for demonetisation in 2014 itself and the Finance Ministry ought to have done contingency plans," Swamy said. They haven't done any preparation and the PM announced the move assuming things will be smooth, he added.
