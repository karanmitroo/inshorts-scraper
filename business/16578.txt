Owing to an absence of demand from jewellers and retailers at domestic markets, leading to a weak global trend, gold prices in the capital plunged by Rs 345 to settle at Rs 26,050 per 10 grams, on Tuesday. Silver also fell largely by Rs 350 to end at Rs 35,150 per kg due to poor offtake by industrial units.
