MakeMyTrip has launched an SMS based bus-ticketing service, India?s first company to do so. Passengers interested in booking ticket will need to SMS @mbus <From-City> <To-City> <Date-of-Travel> <No-of-Passengers> to 9664896648 and consecutively follow onscreen instructions. This is considered a good move to engage non-smartphone users, as Smartphones share only 10% of mobile shipments in India, as per a IDC study.
