US President Donald Trump will not release his tax returns, White House Counsellor Kellyanne Conway said. "The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care. They voted for him," she stated. Notably, Trump made a campaign pledge of releasing his tax returns after an audit.
