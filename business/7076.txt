A court has ordered two Chinese firms to pay entertainment major Walt Disney and Pixar more than $194,440 (over â‚¹1.3 crore) as compensation for copying parts of their movies "Cars" and "Cars 2". Disney had alleged that the characters, titles, and posters from animation film "The Autobots" were substantially similar to those from its movies, China's state-run news agency reported.
