SpiceJet on Monday became the first airline in India to offer passengers the Empty Seat Option (ESo) of paying extra to get preference in securing seats adjacent to vacant seats. The facility on offer subject to availability on SpiceJet's domestic flights came as a result of the Union civil aviation ministry's decision to permit unbundling of services earlier this year.
