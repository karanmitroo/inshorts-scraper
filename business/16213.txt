Twitter is reportedly in talks to acquire ZipDial, an Indian mobile solution startup. The deal has already been closed at $30 million-$40 million and will be announced as soon as this week, the TechCrunch reported quoting a source. However, an another source said the deal has not been closed yet, and a different company (possibly Facebook) too is eyeing ZipDial.
