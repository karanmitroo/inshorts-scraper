Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev on Monday said the ₹2,000 currency note introduced by the government after demonetisation was not good for the country. "I do not like the ₹2000 note as it facilitates corruption. It is easy to carry and can be easily transported," he added. Ramdev also said black money, both inside and outside India, belonged to the people.
