Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka has said that the number of senior-level exits in the company is "far lower" than other companies. Dismissing views that the exits were a cause of concern, Sikka said, "Not at all. This is a complete nonsensical myth that has been propagated in some parts." Notably, Infosys has seen four senior-level exits in 40 days.
