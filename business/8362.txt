Country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India's domestic sales rose 2.2% to 1.23 lakh units over a year-ago period, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The muted growth came due to a 9.8% decline in the sales of its entry-level models of Wagon R and Alto. Maruti's sales of compact car models also dropped 1.8% to 50,116 units.
