Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail has lost cryptocurrency tokens worth about $170 million through "unauthorized transactions". BitGrail's owner Francesco Firano claimed that bugs in the cryptocurrency Nano's software had enabled coins to be "double spent" without the exchange noticing. He added that BitGrail cannot refund 100% of what users lost.
