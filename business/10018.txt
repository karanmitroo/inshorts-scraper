Reliance Jio has accused the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) of "breach of trust" after the telecom lobby wrote to the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office for intervention on Reliance's test launch. Reliance said it reserves the right to seek legal action against COAI for 'maligning and damaging' its interests. Earlier, COAI said Reliance was offering unauthorised commercial services as tests.
