Falling for the sixth straight day, the Sensex on Friday fell by 133.06 points and posted its worst weekly drop in nearly two months. The 30-share index settled lower at 28,717.91, due to weak bluechip earnings coupled with caution ahead of Delhi Assembly polls. The 50-share Nifty also slipped 50.65 points to close below 8,700 mark at 8,661.05.
