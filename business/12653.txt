State-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has pulled out all of its personnel from Syria following the threat from the Islamic State group. “I cannot risk the lives of my colleagues,” ONGC Chairman Dinesh Sarraf said. According to reports, the two oil fields left by the ONGC have been taken over by "jihadi" terrorists.
