Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan on Saturday said that until inflation is brought down, there will be a depreciation of the rupee, which is "necessary" to make the currency competitive. However, he added that the RBI's intent is not to gradually depreciate the rupee but to ensure that inflation is brought down to lower levels.
