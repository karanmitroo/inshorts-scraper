The benchmark Sensex on Monday rose by 216.68 points to settle at 25,735.90, while the broader Nifty gained 72.50 points to close at 7,834.45, amidst aggressive buying by domestic funds tracking positive Asian cues. Analysts attributed the renewed investor risk appetite to the hike in US Federal Reserve's interest rate for the first time since 2006, ending months of uncertainty.
