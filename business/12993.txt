The BSE Sensex on Thursday closed 99.83 points down at 23,962.21, the first time since May 2014 that the index has closed below the 24,000-mark. The NSE Nifty breached the 7,300-mark to close 32.50 points down at 7,276.80. Analysts attributed the fall to weak global cues triggered by falling crude oil prices.
