India’s electricity generation registered a 7.13% increase in the April-July period to 391.16 billion units as against the year-ago period, Power Minister Piyush Goyal has said. Further, the central and state sector power projects’ output rose by 3.94% year-on-year to 265.29 billion units. Rationalisation of freight charges for domestic coal and import reduction led to lower power costs, he added.
