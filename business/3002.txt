Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein reportedly took a dig at US President Donald Trump in a tweet about Monday's solar eclipse, saying, "Wish the moon wasn't the only thing casting a shadow across the country." Notably, Blankfein tweeted for the first time ever in June 2017 to express disapproval over Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord.
