India's largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Tuesday agreed to provide additional interconnect points to Reliance Jio to support its 15 million customers. Reliance Jio, which was commercially launched on September 5, had earlier accused telecom operators of not releasing sufficient interconnection ports. This comes after Idea Cellular offered additional interconnect to Reliance Jio.
