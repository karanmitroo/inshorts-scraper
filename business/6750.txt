German-based Deutsche Bank may withhold bonuses from as many as 90% of its bankers and traders, according to reports. Only the top 10% are expected to receive a bonus for 2016, and those payments may be spread out over the next five years. The bank is exploring alternatives to paying bonuses in cash to shore up investor confidence, sources said.
