Taxi service provider Ola Cabs has launched 'Ola Cafe' food delivery service with a promise of 20-minute delivery time. The Ola app users can select the ‘Cafe’ option to see a location-specific menu offered to them. The service will, however, be available in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi and Mumbai only with specific meal timings.
