Marks & Spencer, Aldi have suspended buying chicken from UK's 2 Sisters Food Group-owned West Bromwich factory. This comes after an investigation by The Guardian revealed the supplier had been tampering with food safety records. The grocers said they have commenced an investigation into claims that workers in the factory were changing slaughter dates of poultry, potentially making them unsafe.
