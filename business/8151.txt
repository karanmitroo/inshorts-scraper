Telecom operators Vodafone and Airtel have extended the deadline for their subscribers to pay mobile phone bills by three days due to the government's move to make current ₹500 and ₹1,000 invalid. They will also provide some talk time/data loan to prepaid customers to ensure continuity of services so that they are not inconvenienced, an Airtel spokesperson said.
