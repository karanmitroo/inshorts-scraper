Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said on Saturday that the consortium of oil exporting countries, OPEC, is expected to reach an agreement to stabilise the oil market at its upcoming meeting, slated to begin on September 26. In case an agreement is not reached, he said the consequences could be "very serious" and can lead to further plummeting of oil prices.
