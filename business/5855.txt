Gerry Harvey, the Chairman of Australian retailer Harvey Norman, has called e-commerce giant Amazon the "worst possible corporate citizen". "Amazon is a marauder. It's crossed America. It's sent lots of businesses broke," he said, adding, "There's not a retailer in the world, practically, that likes Amazon." His statement comes as Amazon reportedly prepares to set up operations in Australia.
