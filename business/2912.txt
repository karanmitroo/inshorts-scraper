Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka has refuted reports that he's joining Hewlett Packard Enterprise as the CTO. "It's not true...I used to be an intern at HP. Someone is keenly trying to put me in a box," he said. Sikka further added, "With Nandan coming in, it wasn't right for me to hang on and I offered to leave immediately."
