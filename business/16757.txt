Indian govt is planning to raise about Rs 5k crore this fiscal (2014-2015) through an exchange traded fund (ETF) by selling stakes in companies including ITC, L&T and Axis Bank, a senior official said Wednesday, adding that the sales could be launched before the March end. Notably, the government raised Rs 4.4k crore through another ETF in March.
