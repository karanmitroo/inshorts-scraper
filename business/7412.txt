The Reserve Bank of India has directed banks to deploy a large majority of the new ₹500 notes in their ATMs and use only a small portion of that currency to service customers through their branches. Earlier, the RBI had said currency notes worth ₹4.27 lakh crore have been issued through banks and ATMs following the demonetisation drive.
