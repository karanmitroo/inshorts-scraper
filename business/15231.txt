Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who is a Harvard dropout, has urged students to graduate with a university degree as it is 'a much surer path to success'. "College graduates are more likely to find a rewarding job, earn higher income, and even, evidence shows, live healthier lives than if they didn't have degrees," Gates wrote in a blog post.
