Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said that the government is considering a proposal to further liberalise the visa policy. A liberalised visa regime will help in the promotion of trade in services in different modes of supply, particularly Mode 2, which includes tourism, medical value travel, and education services, she added.
