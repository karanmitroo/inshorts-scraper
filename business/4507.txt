Responding to NDTV's allegations that CBI raided its premises "without conducting a preliminary enquiry", the agency clarified that searches were conducted based on warrants by a competent court. CBI added investigations against Prannoy and Radhika Roy weren't regarding loan default, but wrongful gain of â‚¹48 crore. CBI further dismissed NDTV's charges, saying it "fully respects freedom of press".
