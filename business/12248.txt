The BSNL board has formally approved the signing of an intra-circle roaming (ICR) pact with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm across all the 22 circles in India. ICR refers to a network operator using the telecommunication services provided by another operator. Jio's services are yet to be commercially launched, and the company earlier announced the commencement of services from April.
