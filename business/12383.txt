Petrol, diesel, LPG and Kerosene will be available at cheaper prices in Maharashtra as oil marketing companies have agreed to remove additional surcharge on products, said state Consumer Protection Minister Girish Bapat. "This would help cut petrol prices in the state by 95 paise and diesel 66 paise in about a week", said Bapat.
