All oil pumps in Manipur were shut down on Saturday due to shortage of petrol and diesel in the state. The shortage happened due to a blockade of the highways on the Karbil Along route in Assam. The blockade, which was caused by some protesters, had obstructed trucks or tankers coming to Nagaland and Manipur, managers of retail outfits said.
