India's merchandise exports in February shrank for the 15th straight month, as it fell 5.66% year-on-year, data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Tuesday suggested. Meanwhile, the country's imports dipped 5.03% from a year earlier, thereby narrowing the trade deficit to $6.54 billion. The change was attributed to weak European demand and falling commodity prices.
