The Infosys board has termed Co-founder Narayana Murthy's "continuous assault and misguided campaign" as the primary reason behind the abrupt resignation of Vishal Sikka as CEO. In a release, Infosys said Murthy demanded that the board adopt certain changes in policy, else he will attack board members in public. The Co-founder's demands have been damaging for the company, it added.
