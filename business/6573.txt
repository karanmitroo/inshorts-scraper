Zimbabwe authorities offered residential land to government employees instead of annual bonus due to a cash crunch in the southern African nation, employee unions said on Thursday. The unions rejected the government's offer and described it as "madness". Owning residential land is reportedly seen as unattractive as most plots lack basic amenities making them difficult to settle on or sell.
