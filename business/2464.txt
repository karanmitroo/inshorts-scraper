Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said if 75% businesses will file GST returns on last day, they are bound to have problems. He urged businesses to file returns well in advance, adding, only 25% had filed returns till September 19. "The capacity of the system is 1 lakh returns per hour, so its maximum capacity is 24 lakh," he added.
