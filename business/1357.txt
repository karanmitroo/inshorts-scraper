Credit rating agency Fitch on Wednesday said that it has withdrawn ratings of debt-ridden Reliance Communications (RCom) for "commercial reasons". The firm will no longer provide analytical coverage or ratings for the Anil Ambani-led company. Earlier, Moody's Investors Service had withdrawn its credit rating on Reliance Communications after it defaulted on interest payment on its bonds.
