After a media report said that sale of Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali's amla juice had been suspended in defence canteens, the company has claimed the product is safe. Patanjali said the confusion had arisen because the product was wrongly tested under FSSAI standards. Earlier, the product was tested at the Central Food Lab in Kolkata, which declared it “unfit for consumption”.
