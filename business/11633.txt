The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) may shift all the 7.5 tonnes of gold it has deposited with various banks to the government's Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) when it matures, TTD Executive Officer D Sambasiva Rao has said. Further, the TTD has asked the government to tweak some rules under the scheme to enable it to make the deposit, Rao added.
