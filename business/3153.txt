Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan has said the board should "shed its ego" and reach out to Narayana Murthy and other founders. Adding that it would be a good idea for the board to immediately invite Murthy as Chairman Emeritus and Chief Mentor, Balakrishnan said, Murthy should take the lead to reconstitute the board to create a sustainable governance framework.
