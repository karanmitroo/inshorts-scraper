Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday said Japan will commit around $30 billion over the next three years in public and private support for the â€‹infrastructural development of Africa. This is an investment for Japan and Africa to grow together, Abe added. Notably, this comes in addition to the $32 billion that Japan had pledged to Africa in 2013.
