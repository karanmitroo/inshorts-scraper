The Central Board of Direct Taxes on Saturday said that Aadhaar will be a "must" for filing of Income Tax Returns or for obtaining a new PAN from July 1. The CBDT issued a statement stating that the Supreme Court has only given a "partial relief" to those who don't have Aadhaar, and the taxman, hence, won't "cancel" their PAN.
