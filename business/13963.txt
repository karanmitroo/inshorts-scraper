In a move to encourage foreigners to invest in rupee-denominated bonds, the Finance Ministry on Thursday announced tax breaks on income from these bonds. On the interest income, a withholding tax of 5% will be applicable for non-resident investors (similar to offshore dollar-denominated bonds). The move came after the RBI allowed Indian Companies to sell rupee-denominated bonds overseas.
