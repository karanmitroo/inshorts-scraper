An anonymous Middle Eastern royal has paid $26 million (₹174 crore) to buy a London parking lot to store his collection of 80 supercars. The parking lot will undergo renovation to get extra-wide bays and cushioned pillars, a car grooming service, license-plate recognition technology, and 24-hour security guards. Notably, the royal's purchase works out at ₹1.27 crore per parking space.
