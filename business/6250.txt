Snapchat on Thursday updated its IPO filing to show that its only woman Director, Joanna Coles, received equal pay compared to the other four male Directors in 2016. In the initial filing, Coles was the least paid among the company's Directors. Snapchat updated the filing and said it previously didn't include a four-year contract that she signed last month.
