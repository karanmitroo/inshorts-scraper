Standard & Poor on Monday retained India's sovereign credit rating at 'BBB-' long-term and 'A-3' short-term as the "outlook for the country remains stable". It added that the ratings reflect improved monetary credibility, policy stability and predictability. "These strengths are balanced against vulnerabilities stemming from the country's low per capita income and weak public finances", said S&P.
