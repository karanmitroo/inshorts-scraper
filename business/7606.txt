Activist investment firm Elliott Management has advised IT consulting firm Cognizant to get rid of a "growth-at-all-costs‚Äù business model, and focus instead on total shareholder returns. The company's rationale for keeping margins artificially low is disguising a lower level of business efficiency, it said. Elliott also suggested Cognizant to enhance its board to benefit from new perspectives.
