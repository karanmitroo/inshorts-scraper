After the valuation of electric carmaker Tesla hit an all-time high on Monday, the company's billionaire CEO Elon Musk took a dig at short sellers or people who bet against its stock by tweeting, "Stormy weather in Shortville." He added, "Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."
