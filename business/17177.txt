Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) made an estimated Rs.50,000 crore profit during 2007-12 by selling oil and petroleum products, as per a new CAG report. On contrary, OMCs have been reporting "under recoveries" to the tune of Rs.1.10 lakh crore every year. The government auditor has observed that all these projected losses are notional due to flawed petroleum pricing.
