Markets regulator SEBI on Wednesday decided that a bourse can freeze holdings of promoters and promoter group entities of companies, which failed to pay fines imposed by the stock exchanges within time. While freezing the holdings, the exchange will have the discretion in determining which of the securities, and holdings of which promoter or promoter group entity will be frozen.
