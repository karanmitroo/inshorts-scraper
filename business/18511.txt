India has agreed to negotiate a Bilateral Investment Treaty with the US on Friday. The issue of the treaty was raised by the US team at a meeting of the CEOs Forum. This was a second major concession to the US in recent days following the shelving of the Preferential Market Access (PMA) provision for the telecom sector last week.
