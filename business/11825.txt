Chip maker Intel on Tuesday said that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11% of its workforce. The restructuring will help in shifting the company's focus from the declining personal computer industry to making microchips that power data centres and internet connected devices, it said. The job cuts will be carried out by mid-2017, Intel added.
