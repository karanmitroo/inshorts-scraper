Royal Dutch Shell on Thursday reported its lowest quarterly earnings in 11 years with profit adjusted for one-time items and inventory changes declining 72% from a year-ago period to $1.05 billion. Loss from upstream unit widened to $1.3 billion from $469 million a year earlier. The loss was attributed to lower energy prices, weaker margins, and production halts, analysts said.
