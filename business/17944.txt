RBI has warned that any political instability after LS poll results (May 2014) would drag the economy further down. "A potential additional source of uncertainty is the coming general elections. A new stable government would be positive for the economy," RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said. The warning comes as some political observers are expecting a hung Parliament post elections.
