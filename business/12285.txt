India-born former Goldman Sachs Director Rajat Gupta has been released after completing his two-year prison term. This comes weeks after a US court agreed to rehear his appeal to throw out his 2012 insider-trading conviction. The 67-year-old was convicted of passing confidential information to one-time friend and business associate Raj Rajaratnam, who is serving an 11-year sentence.
