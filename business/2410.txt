Toyota has no plans to launch an electric vehicle in India, said Shekar Viswanathan, Vice Chairman & Whole-time Director of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM). He said the company will wait for charging infrastructure to develop in India before launching such models. Viswanathan said that electric vehicle technology is simple, and that TKM can launch EVs at short notice.
