Sportswear brand Nike has been targeted by China's annual consumer rights day TV show for falsely advertising its shoes. The programme, a “name-and-shame” show that aims to uncover abuses by companies, said Nike claimed its basketball sneakers had high-tech air cushions inside when they did not. Nike admitted it sold 300 pairs of the shoes in China with "inaccurate description".
