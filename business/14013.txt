Deutsche Bank posted a $6.6 billion loss in the quarter that ended September after the company announced major overhaul in its management. As a result, the company announced that it will slash its workforce by around 35,000 people by 2018 and will exit operations from 10 countries. However, the bank's CEO said it did not have a "strategy problem".
