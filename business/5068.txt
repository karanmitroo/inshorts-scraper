Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh, who was travelling with Jet Airways on Wednesday, took to Twitter to blast the flight's pilot for his alleged racist and violent behaviour towards some fellow travellers on the flight. Harbhajan accused the pilot of physically assaulting a lady and a physically challenged man, and termed the behaviour 'absolutely disgraceful'.
