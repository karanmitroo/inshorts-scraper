Billy McFarland, founder of the Fyre Festival, was arrested on Friday on charges of fraud. Prosecutors said McFarland is accused of misleading investors who invested more than $1 million into Fyre Media, based on misrepresentations of the company's revenue. "McFarland promised a 'life changing' music festival but in actuality delivered a disaster," acting US attorney Joon Kim said.
