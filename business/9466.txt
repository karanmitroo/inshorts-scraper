Deutsche Bank has been asked to pay a fine of $14 billion (approx â‚¹93,611 crores) by the US Department of Justice to settle an investigation into mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. The malpractices by several leading banks are cited as the primary reason for the 2008 financial crisis. The verdict comes on the eighth anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers.
