In a letter to all employees, IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh has said that they will not pursue an Air India bid if it is not profitable and jeopardises the interests of the airline. He added that IndiGo is primarily interested in Air India's international operations. Notably, IndiGo is the first airline to formally express interest in buying Air India.
