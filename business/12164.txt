The government has constituted a panel under former Chief Economic Advisor Ashok Lahri to look into the demands of jewellers protesting against the proposed 1% levy on non-silver jewellery. The panel will review issues related to compliance procedures for excise duty and submit its report in 60 days. This comes after major jeweller associations called off their strike on Saturday.
