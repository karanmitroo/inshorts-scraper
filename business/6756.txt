The world's eight richest people together own assets worth $426 billion, equivalent to the wealth owned by world's poorest 50%, according to a report by charitable organisation Oxfam. Microsoft's Bill Gates is the world's richest person followed by Zara's Amancio Ortega and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The report attributed wealth inequality to aggressive wage restraint and tax dodging.
