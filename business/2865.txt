Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the fallout of demonetisation was on predicted lines and the economy will benefit in medium and long term. "The fact that money got deposited in banks doesn't make it legitimate money," he added. He further said demonetisation, along with GST, will give a "significant boost" to direct tax revenues.
