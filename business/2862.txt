Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy has said, "While keeping quiet may make me seem gentle and 'good', it had the potential to mortally wound the company." "I chose to speak up and question because...I wish to see this company flourish," he added. Earlier, a former Infosys board member had urged Murthy not to "mortally wound" Infosys by persisting in his actions.
