US prosecutors have dropped charges that Lapo Elkann, grandson of late Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli, falsely reported he was kidnapped in November in order to get ransom money. Prosecutors, however, did not disclose why the criminal case was dropped. Elkann was suspected of concocting a fake abduction after running out of cash during a drug-fueled partying binge, reports claimed.
