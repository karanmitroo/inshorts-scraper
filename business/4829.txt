The Income Tax department has launched a new e-facility to link a person's Aadhaar with the Permanent Account Number. The new link requires a person to punch in his/her PAN number, Aadhaar number, and the "exact name as given in the Aadhaar card". Notably, the government has made it mandatory for taxpayers to quote Aadhaar for filing income tax returns.
