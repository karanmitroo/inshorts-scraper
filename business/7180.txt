UK-based grocery chain Co-op has recalled as many as 1,65,000 chocolate Santas after batteries were found in two of them. The food retailer stated that according to investigations, batteries were "deliberately" placed inside the chocolate figures. â€œThe health and safety of our customers is our top priority," Co-op said, adding, people with these products should not eat them.
