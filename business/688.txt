A group of armed robbers allegedly forced a UK cryptocurrency trader to transfer Bitcoin at gunpoint after breaking into his home. The masked men tied up the victim's girlfriend and put their baby outside in a pram while forcing him to transfer the cryptocurrency, reports said. This is believed to be the first heist of its kind in the UK.
