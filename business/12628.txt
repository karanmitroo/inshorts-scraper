The benchmark Sensex and broader Nifty lost over 6.5% in the week ended February 12, their biggest weekly fall since July 2009. Analysts attributed the losses to weak quarterly earnings by key corporates, a sliding rupee and weak global markets. While the Sensex lost 1,630.85 points to close at 22,986.12, the Nifty fell by 508.15 points to settle at 6,980.95.
