Amid reports of mass layoffs, former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan has said, "IT industry is not bad, IT industry people are well taken care of, well-paid, and they find opportunities." "So, I don't find a need for union in this industry," he stated. He further noted, "Even if there's a union, I don't think it will impact the industry much."
