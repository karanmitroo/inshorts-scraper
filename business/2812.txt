Congress leader Kapil Sibal said the drop in growth rate has been 3%, which means loss to the country of over â‚¹4 lakh crore. He called demonetisation the biggest scam, saying 99% of "all alleged black money has been converted into alleged white money". Demonetisation destroyed "jobs, economy, life of a labourer, construction industry, farmers, and small businesses", he added.
