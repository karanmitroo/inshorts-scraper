Customers will not suffer any loss if unauthorised electronic banking transactions are reported within three days, according to RBI. Further, the amount involved will be credited to the accounts concerned within 10 days. These rules will be applicable for third-party breaches, where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but elsewhere in the system.
