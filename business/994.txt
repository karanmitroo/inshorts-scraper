Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the credit growth in the banking system has started improving slowly after the government's recent decision to recapitalise public sector banks. He said that credit growth would go further up once the infusion of capital takes place. Jaitley added that "green shoots" in the economy are now visible after a series of structural reforms.
