Bank of France Governor Fran√ßois Villeroy de Galhau has said, "Bitcoin is in no way a currency, or even a cryptocurrency." Bitcoin is a speculative asset and people must invest in it at their own risk, he added. "Its value and extreme volatility have no economic basis, and they are nobody's responsibility," he further said.
