After Samsung heir Jay Y. Lee's imprisonment, the South Korean company may ask his sister Lee Boo-jin to lead, breaking away from the tradition of male-dominated succession. Boo-jin has a net worth of $1.81 billion and owns 5.5% of the company. She is also the CEO of Samsung's Hotel Shilla, one of Seoul's top lodging and conference centres.
