In an effort to unearth money laundering, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday checked records of over 50 bank branches, with a special eye on Jan Dhan, student, and dormant accounts. The ED said the action was taken in wake of allegations that certain bank officials are involved in the conversion of black money into white in lieu of commission.
