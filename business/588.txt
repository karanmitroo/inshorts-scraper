During his 2018 Budget speech, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the government will introduce an 'e-assessment system' for taxpayers to reduce "person-to-person contact". This is aimed at promoting efficiency and transparency. The scheme, which was launched on a pilot basis in 2016, has reduced interface between the Income Tax Department and taxpayers in 102 cities, he added.
