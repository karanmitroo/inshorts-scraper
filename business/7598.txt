In order to protect farmers and rural account holders from money launderers, the RBI on Wednesday limited the cash withdrawal from KYC-linked Jan Dhan accounts to ₹10,000 a month. Withdrawals beyond ₹10,000 will be allowed by bankers only after ascertaining the genuineness of such withdrawals. Notably, Jan Dhan deposits rose by 60% in two weeks after note ban.
