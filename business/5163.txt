United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz on Tuesday said no one will be fired over the incident of a 69-year-old passenger being dragged off an overbooked flight. Munoz said, "It was a system failure across various areas. There was never a consideration for firing an employee." He added that the board of United Continental Holdings was supporting him.
