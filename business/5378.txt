Puma has sued retail fashion label Forever 21 accusing the company of copying a number of the Fenty X Rihanna designs created by singer Rihanna. Puma is demanding the retailer to stop selling the alleged rip-offs of Puma's fur slides, bow slides and creepers. It has also demanded that Forever 21 hand over all profits it has made from them.
