The Corporate Affairs Ministry said it is amending the form for reporting annual financial statements under the Companies Act to include mandatory corporate social responsibility-related details. This would help extract CSR spending-related data more efficiently, an official said. Further, companies have to submit revised statements in respect of financial years starting on or after April 1, 2014.
