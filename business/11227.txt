US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Saturday said the central bank should raise interest rates "in the coming months" if the country's economy picks up as expected and jobs continue to be generated. The Fed had raised its key benchmark interest rate to 0.25-0.5% in December for the first time in nearly a decade.
