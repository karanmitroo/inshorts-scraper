Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that any economic impact arising out of recent tensions with Pakistan and incidents like the surgical strikes undertaken by the Indian Army will be “extremely marginal”. Any impact that had been felt by the markets and the rupee had been “temporary”, and foreign direct investment (FDI) into India “continues to increase”, he added.
