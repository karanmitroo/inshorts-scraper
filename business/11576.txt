State-run NTPC has issued notices to Delhi-based power distribution companies (discoms) BSES Rajdhani and BSES Yamuna, saying the power supply to them would be regulated from May 10 if the firms do not clear their dues amounting to â‚¹1,300 crore. NTPC added it would supply the excess power resulting from regulating supply to any region that requests for it.
