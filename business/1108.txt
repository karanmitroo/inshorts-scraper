Kingfisher Airlines Founder Vijay Mallya is a "victim of flamboyance and arrogance rather than any political conspiracy", Air Deccan Chairman GR Gopinath has said. "I think he should have acted sooner by mobilising funds from his other liquor companies and rescued Kingfisher Airlines," he added. Mallya was "not wise" about his activities during the days of default, he further said.
