Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in a Facebook post said November 8, 2016 would be remembered as a "watershed moment" in the history of Indian economy. He said the day is significant as the country was cured from the "dreaded disease of black money". Jaitley added India has moved on to a much cleaner, transparent and honest financial system post demonetisation.
