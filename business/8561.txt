The Khadi and Village Industries Commission outlet in Delhi on Saturday registered record ₹1.08 crore sale in one day, its highest so far. This was due to an appeal made by PM Narendra Modi, which impacted a four-fold rise in Khadi sales, Chairman VK Saxena said. Modi recently said today’s mantra should be “khadi for nation and khadi for fashion”.
