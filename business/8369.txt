The European Union and Canada on Sunday signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a free trade deal. This enables the provisional implementation of the pact by early-2017, but it needs to be cleared by around 40 national and regional parliaments in Europe. CETA eliminates tariffs on almost 99% of goods and will reportedly increase Canadian-EU trade by 20%.
