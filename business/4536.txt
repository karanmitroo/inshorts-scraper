India's GDP growth slowed down to 6.1% year-on-year during the January-March period, less than economists' 7.1% estimate, government data showed on Wednesday. Further, government data showed that GDP grew 7.1% in the full financial year 2016-17, slower than the 8% recorded in the previous year. The slump followed the government's note ban decision, which slowed activity in cash-dependent sectors.
