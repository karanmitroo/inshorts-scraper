Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Friday urged people to not get lured by ‘money converters’ claiming to turn unaccounted money into white. He asked people to not "be a partner in this crime of converting black money into black again". Earlier, the government said housewives and artisans could be prosecuted by the I-T department for allowing misuse of their accounts.
