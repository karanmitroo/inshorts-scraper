Videocon Telecommunications is reportedly planning to file an over â‚¹10,000-crore compensation claim against the government after a CBI court acquitted all accused in 2G spectrum case. The Supreme Court in 2012 had cancelled Videocon's 15 telecom licences in 2G spectrum allocation done under the then Telecom Minister A Raja. Videocon alleged the licence cancellation caused huge financial losses.
