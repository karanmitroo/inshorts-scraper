The GST Network has initiated the process of mining data to analyse taxpayer behaviour and detect tax evasion, according to reports. GSTN will soon solicit proposals from companies as it needs tools and manpower for data analytics, CEO Prakash Kumar has said. "We should be able to slice and dice the data whichever way we want," he added.
