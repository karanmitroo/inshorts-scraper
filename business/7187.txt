Banking major Barclays and two former executives are being sued by the US Department of Justice over alleged fraud in the sale of mortgage-backed securities in run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Barclays was accused of deceiving investors about loan quality between 2005-2007. The lawsuit was reportedly filed after Barclays resisted a penalty by the US government in settlement negotiations.
