The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has reported that the Kerala's Cochin Port flouted the International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT) tender norms with container port operator DP World. Port authorities requested DP World to start construction of the ICTT before the existing terminal reached the agreed traffic volume in return for post-tender concessions worth â‚¹40.23 crore.
