Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has accused incumbent operators Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular, and Vodafone of refusing to enable their mobile phone users to port or switch to the new operator. In this regard, Jio has told telecom operator TRAI that the incumbents are perpetrating “illegal and perverse actions”, adding that "this is a clear and deliberate breach" of licence conditions.
