Liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Monday distanced himself from an interview, allegedly given to the Sunday Guardian, quoting him as saying that time was not "right" for him to return to India. "Shocked to see media statements that I gave an interview to Sunday Guardian without verification. I have not given any statement to anyone," Mallya tweeted.
