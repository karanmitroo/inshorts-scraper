IT giant Cognizant struck its biggest deal on Monday, acquiring IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $2.7 billion to beef up its slowing healthcare business. Cognizant's healthcare business, which accounted for about 26% of total revenue in 2013, has declined in the last three quarters. Notably, the company in August forecast its slowest full-year sales growth in its 20-year history.
