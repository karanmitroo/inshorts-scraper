Liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Tuesday lashed out at the media on Twitter and asked them to "check and verify facts" before calling him a defaulter. Mallya also tweeted, "Agree Kingfisher Air owes money to Banks. I am neither a borrower or a judgement debtor. Why am I a defaulter in spite of a settlement offer?"
