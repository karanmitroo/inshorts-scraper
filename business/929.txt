The North American Bitcoin Conference, which is to be held in Miami, US next week, is no longer accepting Bitcoin payments for tickets due to high fees and network congestion. The organisers said transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain exceed $30 (â‚¹1,900) at certain times of the day. Notably, the last minute tickets for the event are priced at $1,000.
