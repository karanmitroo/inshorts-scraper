SpiceJet has extended its flight cancellations till January 31, 2015, affecting at least 329 flights, including mostly domestic flights and a few connecting Nepal and Afghanistan. This follows after the cash-strapped carrier recently cancelled over 1,800 flights till December 31, 2014. The airline is currently awaiting the much-needed capital to come out of the persisting financial crunch.
