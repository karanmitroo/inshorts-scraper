Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that achieving a 10% GDP growth rate is "very challenging" and will depend on how the world is moving. He said India has done well by growing at a rate of 7-8% during the last three years. "We brought structural changes when the rest of the world was slowing down," he added.
