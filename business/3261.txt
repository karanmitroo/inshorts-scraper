The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to accept Sahara chief Subrata Roy’s plea to put on hold the auction process of Sahara's Aamby Valley. Sahara said that the auction process should be put on hold till September so that it could arrange ₹1,500 crore which has to be deposited into Sebi-Sahara account. Notably, Aamby Valley is worth around ₹34,000 crore.
