The Reserve Bank of India has asked the banks not to collect photocopies of customers' identities for the exchange of old currency notes. Customers can exchange their old currency notes at banks and post offices by only presenting a valid ID proof like Aadhaar or PAN card. Most of the banks including SBI branches have been demanding ID proof photocopies.
