Twitter's market share fell 18% on Tuesday after their disappointing quarterly financial report was leaked on Twitter itself by the financial analytics firm Selerity, hours before the scheduled released. The market paused for the micro-blogging site to disseminate the reports, but the fall only steepened. The company's revenue growth was 74% this quarter compared to fourth quarter's 97%.
