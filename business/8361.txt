A few listed firms of the Tata group have filed clarifications with the NSE after the stock exchange sought an explanation about “deficiencies” pointed out by ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry. He had raised governance issues and highlighted weaknesses in several Tata companies. These firms said they had followed the law and made adequate disclosures but didn't comment on specific “deficiencies.”
