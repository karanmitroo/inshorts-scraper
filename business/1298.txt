NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said the days of physical banks were ending, and the banks unable to transition to data analytics and digital banking would die by 2020. "In the next two-three years, everyone will have a smartphone...By 2020, we will have a billion people connected to Internet," Kant said. These transitions will drive financial inclusion, he added.
