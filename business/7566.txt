The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday reached an agreement to cut their production of oil at a meeting in Vienna in an effort to raise crude oil prices. The cartel will now cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, which accounts for nearly 1.3% of the entire world's daily oil production.
