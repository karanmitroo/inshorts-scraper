In a move to promote a fast track route of raising capital from markets, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Thursday proposed e-IPO norms. Under the norms, investors can bid for shares through Internet and eventually on mobiles. SEBI has proposed to cut the timeline for shares' listing within 2-3 days of the IPO, as against 12 days currently.
