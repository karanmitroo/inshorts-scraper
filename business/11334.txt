India and Iran on Monday signed a pact during PM's ongoing visit that allows India to operate the Chabahar port in Iran. The pact gives India access to Iran by sea and then to Afghanistan, Russia and Europe through a road-rail network, thus bypassing Pakistan, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said. India signed a total of 12 pacts across various sectors.
