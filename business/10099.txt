State Bank of India's logo, a blue circle with a cut in the centre, was designed by the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad and is said to be inspired by the city's Kankaria Lake. The state-run lender on Thursday approved its merger with its five associate banks, including the State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank.
