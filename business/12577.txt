The Indian rupee weakened by 24 paise to hit a 30-month low of 68.62 against the dollar in early trade on Wednesday, on sustained foreign fund outflows amid increased demand for the US currency from importers. The dollarâ€™s strength against some other currencies overseas and a sharp fall in the domestic stock market also weighed on the rupee, dealers said.
