Brent Crude Oil on Thursday was trading at around $48.89 per barrel, down by about 7% this week, as world's major exporters pumped more than half a billion barrels more crude than required this year, as suggested by Reuters. Goldman Sachs head of commodities market said there is less than 50% possibility of oil price falling below $20 per barrel.
