India's leading pharmaceutical firm Sun Pharma's shares plunged by nearly 24% in 2016, which is its worst performance ever since the company was listed on Indian stock exchanges back in 1994. Further, the stock underperformed the benchmark Sensex index in 2016 for the first time in seven years due to lingering regulatory issues at its manufacturing units.
