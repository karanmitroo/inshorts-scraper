The rupee fell marginally by 4 paise to 63.59 against one US dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market on Wednesday. This happened due to a fresh demand for dollar from importers and a lower opening in the domestic equity market. The rupee had bounced back by 11 paise on Tuesday on fresh selling of dollars by banks.
