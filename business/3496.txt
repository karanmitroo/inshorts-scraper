Ben Van Beurden, CEO of Europe's biggest listed oil company Royal Dutch Shell, said that the next thing he'll buy is a car that doesn't run either on oil or gas. Van Beurden will switch from a diesel car to a plug-in Mercedes-Benz S500e in September. "The whole move to electrify the economy, electrify mobility...is a good thing," he said.
