Marlboro cigarettes maker has been accused of trying to sidestep new UK laws on plain packaging by rolling out durable tins that look like ordinary cigarette packets. It's an "immature trick" to "retain" its branding, an official said. Under the laws, retailers can't sell branded cigarette packets and can only stock plain packets featuring graphic pictures designed to deter smokers.
