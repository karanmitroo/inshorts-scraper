UK shoe manufacturer Clarks has been accused of sexism for calling its new girls' shoe range "Dolly Babe" and the boys' equivalent as "Leader". Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland tweeted, "It's almost beyond belief that in 2017 a major company could think this is in any way acceptable." Following the complaints, Clarks removed 'Dolly Babe' range from its website.
