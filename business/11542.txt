The Finance Ministry on Friday gave its clearance for the creation of a 'Government e-Marketplace' for online purchase of commonly used goods and services by various central government ministries and departments. The Directorate General Supply and Disposal (DGS&D) will be hosting the website, the Ministry said. The marketplace will also reportedly facilitate bidding and online reverse auction.
