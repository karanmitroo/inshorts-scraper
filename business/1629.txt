Indian drugmaker Lupin was issued a warning letter by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for repeated quality violations at its Goa and Indore's manufacturing facilities. In 2015 and 2016, the FDA found 134 instances when drugs or active ingredients failed initial testing. Lupin Managing Director Nilesh Gupta said it would take about six months to address FDA's concerns.
