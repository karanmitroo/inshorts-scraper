A Mexican group has filed a class action lawsuit against petroleum company BP over its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. According to the group's head, no claims were made at that time because the spill did not affect Mexican coast. However, with time, the contamination had spread and "started to affect people along the Mexican coast", he added.
