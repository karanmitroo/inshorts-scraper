Former Ford CEO Mark Fields could reportedly get a payout worth about â‚¹370 crore following his ouster from the automaker. The largest portion of the compensation will be in unvested stock awards and retirement benefits, and he will be able to use Ford's aircraft until August 1. Fields was replaced in response to investors' growing unease over Ford's falling shares.
