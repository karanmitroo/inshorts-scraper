India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has said it will hire over 9,500 people for customer support and sales functions. This comes after the bank's employee strength had gone down by over 10,000 during the current fiscal after its merger with associate banks. The introduction of digital banking has reportedly reduced the requirement of administrative staff.
