Vodafone India's Managing Director and CEO Sunil Sood on Wednesday hit back at Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio's strategy and said, "It's not only about pricing. Pricing is a strategy, which is not a long-term differentiator." On company's plan to go for an IPO, Sood said that there's a high chance that the IPO will be moved to the next year.
