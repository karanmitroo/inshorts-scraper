A drunk airline pilot who passed out in the cockpit before takeoff was sentenced to eight months jail in Canada on Monday. The pilot had pleaded guilty last month to having control of an aircraft while he had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. Further, he has been banned from flying for one year after his release.
