Canada-born gambling and Bitcoin multi-millionaire Calvin Ayre is building a $100 million (nearly â‚¹650 crore) five-star resort on Antigua. The resort, which will accept Bitcoin Cash, will be funded by profits from the rise in Bitcoin's value. Ayre, who was once on the run from American authorities, has been given the official title of "His Excellency" by Antigua and Barbuda.
