In his first interview since Demonetisation, PM Narendra Modi said that the move's strategy can be aptly summarised by the age-old saying of 'Tu daal-daal, main paat-paat' which means staying a step ahead of the enemy. "The decision of demonetisation, which reflects our Niti (policy), is unequivocally clear, unwavering and categorical," he added.
