SpiceJet, that has hiked excess baggage rates, on Wednesday said the charges would help low-cost carriers "provide lucrative fares" and remain competitive in market. However, the airline emphasised that it has kept reasonable amount of luggage free for passengers. Notably, SpiceJet increased excess baggage charges to ₹1,425 from ₹500 for 5 kg above the free 15 kg allowed.
