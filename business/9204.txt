Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio on Wednesday slammed the telecom body COAI for terming Jio a 'back door operator', calling the allegation 'contempt of court' as the charge was already rejected by the Supreme Court. Reliance had earlier written to COAI seeking an overhaul of current rules, alleging that the current norms were skewed in favour of existing operators.
