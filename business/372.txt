After PNB revealed that jeweller Nirav Modi-linked firms defrauded the bank of $1.77 billion, a user tweeted, "Finding NiMo, a movie by Punjab National Bank." Another user tweeted, "If Nirav Modi had linked his Aadhaar, none of this would have happened." "Rich is just a euphemism for 'expert thief' in India," read another tweet.
