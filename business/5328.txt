An SBI-led group of lenders has managed to sell Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Villa in Goa, after three failed attempts, to film production company Viiking Media & Entertainment, owned by actor-businessman Sachiin Joshi, reports said. Joshi reportedly paid marginally more than the property's previous reserve price of ₹73 crore. Notably, Mallya owes over ₹9000 crore to the SBI-led consortium.
