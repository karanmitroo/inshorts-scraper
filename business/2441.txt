Mankind Pharma has pulled down almost 500 Navratri-themed hoardings featuring Sunny Leone promoting its Manforce condoms across Gujarat. This comes after a traders' body protested the campaign's reference to the ongoing Navratri festival, calling it insulting and extremely irresponsible. Manforce has apologised for the ad campaign and said it was not meant to hurt anyone's sentiments.
