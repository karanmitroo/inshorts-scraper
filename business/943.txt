The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in single-brand retail via automatic route. This makes it easier for foreign brands to fully own their Indian stores when earlier they needed to partner with local brands. This was aimed at liberalising and simplifying FDI policy to improve ease of doing business in the country.
