Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal on Tuesday said the issues with telecom operator Reliance Jio will be resolved in a few weeks. This comes amid the ongoing spat between the telecom operators over the interconnection points provided to Reliance Jio, after regulator TRAI's directives. Earlier, Reliance Jio had accused telecom operators including Airtel of not letting customers port their numbers.
