A court in Thailand on Friday issued an arrest warrant for the heir of Red Bull energy drink fortune, Vorayuth Yoovidhya, who is accused of killing a policeman while speeding in Bangkok in 2012. This comes after Yoovidhya missed summons to report to court on Thursday for the eighth time since legal proceedings against him began in 2016.
