Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has said the government hasn't taken a final decision yet on how much stake in Air India it wants to sell. "There are lots of suggestion, there is lots of thinking," he said. Earlier, Union Minister Jayant Sinha said that over 51% of Air India will be transferred to the private sector.
