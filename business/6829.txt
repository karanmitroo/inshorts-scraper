A sum of $10 billion (over â‚¹68,000 crore) would be spent in next five years to develop India's airport infrastructure to make it the world's third largest aviation market, Civil Aviation Secretary RN Choubey said. Around 400 unused airstrips would be brought back to life, he said. Civil aviation is now just as popular and necessary as Railways, he added.
