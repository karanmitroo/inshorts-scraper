The government has said that it is not considering an extension of the December 30 deadline for depositing the now invalid ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. There is sufficient cash available with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the banks, it stated. Notably, people have withdrawn over ₹2 lakh crore and deposited over ₹8.11 lakh crore in banks post demonetisation.
