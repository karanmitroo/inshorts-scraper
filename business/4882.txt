An Australian man is suing American Airlines for over $74,000 (â‚¹47 lakh) after being forced to sit next to two "grossly obese" passengers on a flight from Sydney to Los Angeles in December 2015. The man, who repeatedly asked to change his seat, claimed he was forced to "contort" his body into positions which worsened an existing back problem.
