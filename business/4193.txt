In response to Qatar Airways' interest to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines, CEO Doug Parker said that he "found it confusing". "Why an airline we are aggressively fighting would want to take a stake makes no sense," he stated. He further described the proposal as "puzzling" given the company's stance on illegal subsidies Qatar received from its government.
