The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has pulled up Reliance Industries for charging a rate in excess of the government approved price for its KG-D6 gas field. The CAG in a draft report stated that the company charged $4.205 per mmBtu (million British thermal unit) from consumers, leading to excess billing of $9.68 million.
