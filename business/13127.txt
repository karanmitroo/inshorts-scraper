Banks and financial institutions, in their pre-Budget meeting with FM Arun Jaitley on Tuesday, pitched for increasing the tax deduction limit under section 80C of Income Tax Act to ₹2.5 lakh from ₹1.5 lakh. They further recommended reducing the lock-in period on tax-free fixed deposits from five years to one year to attract more depositors to come into the system.
