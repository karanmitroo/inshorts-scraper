Following the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision on Thursday to cut its deposit rate to a historic-low (-)0.3% and continue its bond-buying program, the euro surged 3.1%, its highest single-day gain since March 2009. The move dampened sentiment in Asian markets where stocks tumbled. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2% while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled 1.5%.
