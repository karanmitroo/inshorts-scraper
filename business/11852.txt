Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said that the share of developing and transition countries (DTCs) in multi-lateral lending agencies like International Finance Corporation should be increased to 50%. The GDP of a nation should be the primary factor in deciding its share, he said, while adding that quotas in the IMF do not reflect the economic realities.
