After a fake story about the creator of digital currency Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, dying in a car crash was posted on troll site 4Chan, the currency's price plunged. The hoax coincided with the market value of Ethereum falling by $4 billion (nearly â‚¹26,000 crore). Buterin ended the rumours by posting a picture of new data from Ethereum on Twitter.
