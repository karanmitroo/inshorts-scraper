JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said, "It's almost an embarrassment being an American travelling around the world." Dimon, a member of President Trump's advisory council, said he doesnâ€™t like listening to the "stupid shit" Americans have to deal with, and highlighted US' failures. When a reporter asked if he's frustrated with Trump administration, Dimon replied, "No, that was frustration with you."
