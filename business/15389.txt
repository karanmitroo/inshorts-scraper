Suri Payala, a former Indian employee of Wipro, has sued the company in a US court alleging violation of local labour laws. Payala, who worked with Wipro for the first half of 2014, has claimed that the company failed to compensate him for overtime and make other wage settlements. In an e-mail, Wipro said it will "vigorously defend these allegations."
