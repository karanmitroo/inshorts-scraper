No tax officer is authorised to visit premises of traders and shopkeepers without prior permission, the government said in a statement. It further stated anyone facing any such problem can lodge a complaint on tax department's phone line, 011-23370115. The clarification comes amid reports of "unscrupulous elements" posing as GST officers to fleece shopkeepers and customers in name of GST.
