While petroleum is not taxed under GST, the government clarified that domestic and commercial LPG will be taxed under the new regime. Domestic LPG, which earlier attracted VAT ranging from 2-4% based on the state, was placed in the lowest 5% bracket. LPG for commercial use, which earlier attracted 22.5% tax, is now taxed 18% under GST.
