Elon Musk-led electric vehicle startup Tesla's $2.6-billion merger with solar panel maker SolarCity would contribute over $1 billion to Tesla's revenue in 2017, the company has said. The merger would further add over $500 million in cash to Tesla's balance sheet over the next three years. The largest shareholder in both the companies, Musk calls the merger a "no brainer."
