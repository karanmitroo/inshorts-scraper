Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has allowed Spicjet to accept advance bookings beyond March 31. The DGCA had earlier restricted SpiceJet to take advance bookings only up to March 31. The flights are now open for the summer schedule of the airlines in India, which commences from March 29 and lasts up to October end, SpiceJet said.
