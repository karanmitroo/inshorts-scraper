The UAE on Sunday began collecting new "sin" taxes on tobacco products, energy drinks, and soft drinks. Tobacco and energy drinks will be taxed at 100%, while a 50% tax will be levied on soft drinks. This comes as the country aims to diversify revenue generation from sources other than oil and cope with low global energy prices.
