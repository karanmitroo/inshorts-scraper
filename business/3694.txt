The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has sought an eviction order against the Le Meridien hotel. This comes after NDMC cancelled Le Meridien's licence in March this year over non-payment of license fees amounting to â‚¹523 crore that have accumulated over 30 years. Earlier, NDMC had ordered action against four officials over alleged irregularities in the recovery of dues.
