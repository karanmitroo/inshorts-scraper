Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was slammed on social media after he posted an image of his newborn daughter at the doctorâ€™s. While some supported his implicit endorsement of child vaccination, others opposed the move with comments like, "Pharmaceutical companies make HUGE profits off of a sick society". In the US, protestors claim that vaccinating children can cause disorders in them.
