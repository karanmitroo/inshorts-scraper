Gold prices fell by another Rs. 50 on Tuesday, closing at Rs. 28,550 per ten grams. According to traders, apart from subdued demand from jewellers and retailers, a weakening global trend on easing of tensions in Ukraine mainly kept pressure on gold prices. The prices of the yellow metal have been falling, losing Rs. 220 in the past 3 days.
