Cognizant CEO Francisco D'souza said he doesn't see activist shareholders like Elliott Management as a risk, but rather constructive for the company in the long run. He further said, "From a 'learnings from Elliott' standpoint, we had a constructive conversation with a shareholder that had ideas about how we should run the business".
