Reliance's Falcon 9X - a super luxury business jet used by Mukesh Ambani - was grounded following surprise checks on Saturday. The directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) suspended the aircraft's commander as he did not have a flying licence with him. Moreover, the aircraft also violated other security norms.
