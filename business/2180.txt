American economist Elinor Ostrom is the only woman to have ever been awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences since its inception in 1968. Ostrom, who shared the $1.44 million prize with another American economist in 2009, was recognized "for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons". She studied how small, local communities manage their shared natural resources.
