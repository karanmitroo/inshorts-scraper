Industrialist Nusli Wadia, an independent director on some Tata Group companies, has filed a defamation case against the Tata Sons board asking it to withdraw "false, defamatory, and libellous" allegations against him immediately. This follows Tatas' move to remove Wadia from the firms' boards. He further said the move was an attempt to "tarnish his personal integrity and corporate image".
