The Hinduja Group has formally acquired the iconic Old War Office building in central London, in partnership with a Spanish company. The 1,100-room heritage building, close to the British Parliament, was once occupied by Britain's former prime minister Winston Churchill. Bought for an undisclosed sum, the building would be restored and redeveloped into a five-star hotel and residential apartments.
