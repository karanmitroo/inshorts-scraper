Income Tax authorities are entitled to conduct surveys on charitable institutions found violating laws and there should be no sympathy for them, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. He cited examples of hospitals and religious institutions, which got tax exemptions and later became commercial entities. "If somebody is violating the law, let him be surveyed, why should we sympathise?" Jaitley said.
