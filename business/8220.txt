Britain's biggest potato chips maker Walkers is going to raise the price of a packet of crisps by  10% following the slump in the pound's value after the 'Brexit' vote. The fall in pound's value increased its manufacturing costs, the company stated. Earlier, Unilever, the maker of Magnum ice cream, also pushed for a 10% rise in its products' prices.
