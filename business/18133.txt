Hoping to regain the smartphone market footing, BlackBerry Ltd will pay its new interim-CEO John Chen a base salary of $1 million, a double bonus and stock awards worth $85 million. Previously credited with turning around Sybase Inc, Chen has been appointed after BlackBerry abandoned plans to sell itself and opted to raise funds via a $1 billion notes offering.
