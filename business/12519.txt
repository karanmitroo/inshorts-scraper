Ahead of the Railway budget, industry body Assocham on Tuesday asked Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu to muster political courage and announce a hike in passenger fares. It would reduce the losses on commuter traffic, currently at 68% of passenger earnings, and would reduce over recoveries from freight traffic which is meant to recover losses from passenger segment, Assocham said.
