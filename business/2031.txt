Personal care brand Nivea has been slammed for a body lotion advertisement promising "visibly fairer skin" for black women. Social media users called the advertisement, which appeared in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Senegal, "racist" and "colourist" and urged to take it down. A woman tweeted, "This is not how to market in Africa. We didn't want 'FAIRER SKIN' thank you."
