World Bank's Chief Economist Paul Romer has resigned from his post after he alleged that Chile's decline in ease of doing business rankings was due to methodological changes that could have been politically motivated. He had apologised to Chile for conveying the "wrong impression" after its ranking fell from 34 in 2014 to 57 in 2017.
