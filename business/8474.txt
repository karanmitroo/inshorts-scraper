Cyrus Mistry, who was replaced as Tata Chairman, has criticised the decision in an email to the board. “I have to say that the board has not covered itself with glory. To “replace” your chairman without so much as a word of explanation and without affording him an opportunity to defend himself...must be unique in...corporate history,” Mistry reportedly said.
