Argentina on Tuesday returned to international markets after 15 years with a $16.5 billion dollar bond sale, after it defaulted on $100 billion worth US dollar debt in 2001. The sale comes following the election of President Mauricio Macri in November who has enacted a number of measures aimed at improving the country's finances and attracting international investment.
