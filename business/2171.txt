In a message to employees, Air India chief Rajiv Bansal has said, "While we strive to make improvements in our services, be it in-flight catering or entertainment... we must ensure that not even a single 'paisa' is wasted." Bansal added, "We ought to shun all avoidable and wasteful expenditure and adopt thrifty work practices without compromising with safety and quality."
