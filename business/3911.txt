Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is investigating claims of users' personal data being leaked onto a website called “magicapk”, but assured that the claim was “unauthentic”. A Jio spokesperson said subscriber data was safe and maintained with the highest security. The information made available on the website, which has now been suspended, included customers’ names and phone numbers, among others.
