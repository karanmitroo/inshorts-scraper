Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma has alleged that an HDFC Bank representative manually deleted the digital wallet app from one of its customers' phone. An incident shared by Sharma hinted that this move by HDFC was aimed to promote its own app PayZapp. Paytm's Senior VP Deepak Abbot tweeted, "In all my app uninstall analysis in life, never factored this".
