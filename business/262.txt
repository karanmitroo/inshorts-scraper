Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani has said Reliance Jio, which has already invested  ₹20,000 crore in Uttar Pradesh, will invest another ₹10,000 crore in the state. Ambani said that this will create over one lakh jobs in UP over the next three years. "If UP gets up and running, nobody can stop India from being a global superpower," Ambani added.
