Shares of Shenzhen-based technology giant Tencent have tumbled 13% from their September high, wiping $35 billion off the company's value. Overseas funds have pulled money from Hong Kong and Chinese equities in this period over concerns of a weakening yuan. Tencent had become Asia's most valuable company in September with a valuation of $263 billion.
