Talking about Initial Coin Offerings, a means of crowdfunding for blockchain-technology, Ethereum Co-founder Charles Hoskinson said, "People say ICOs are great for Ethereum because, look at the price, but it's a ticking time-bomb." He added that people are blinded by fast and easy money. Notably, firms have reportedly raised $1.3 billion this year through ICOs, a 6-fold increase from 2016.
