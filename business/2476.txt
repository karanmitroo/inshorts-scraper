Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, has hit $1 trillion for the first time on Tuesday. Norway's central bank which maintains the fund has said that strong equity markets in 2017 and a weaker US dollar were responsible for the milestone. Notably, the Norwegian government first transferred oil revenue to the fund in May 1996.
