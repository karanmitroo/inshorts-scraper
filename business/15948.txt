US-based Mirach Wednesday said it returned the entire due diligence fees of $2.625 million to Sahara, and ended the proposed loan to the Indian group amid “forged letter” controversy. The $2.05-billion financing deal involved transfer of loans taken by Saharas from Bank of China for its three overseas hotels. Mirach was entitled to fees related to legal and transaction-related costs.
