Global mobile industry body GSMA on Thursday called upon the government to reconsider the pricing of 700 MHz band that failed to find takers in the just-concluded auction due to its “unrealistically” high price. "Operators have been asked to pay some of the highest rates...compared to other markets even though [India] has a low average revenue per user," GSMA added.
