Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, following his meeting with Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, has suggested that the state government should develop its tourism and textile sectors. He added that these sectors have a "great" potential to generate employment, particularly for women. Odisha should also try and move to become a model state by creating more labour-intensive industries, he said.
