Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra on Friday said, "Biggest risk is not taking any risk," adding this government is taking risks like demonetisation and Make in India. "Why would we not want Make In India? The objective is laudable," he stated. India is possibly the best manufacturing hub, and this is proof that 'Make in India' is successful, Mahindra added.
