National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Wednesday said only 1% of India's over 125 crore population pays Income Tax. Addressing a workshop on cashless transactions, Kant said if the economy has to be taken from $2 trillion to $10 trillion by 2030, then India cannot afford that 95% of its transactions are in cash.
