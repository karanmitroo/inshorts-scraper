German automaker BMW will start recalling over 1.93 lakh cars from August 2017 in China over a defect in their airbags. The cars are being recalled as the gas generators inside the inflating airbags may damage and cause flying debris, posing safety risks to the passengers. BMW has promised to replace the defective airbags free of charge.
