Gold prices Monday went up by Rs 130 to Rs 26,930 per 10 grams on increased buying amid ongoing wedding season demand. Silver also advanced by Rs 100 to Rs 36,650 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers. Traders said wedding season demand mainly kept gold-silver prices higher, but a weak trend overseas limited the gains.
