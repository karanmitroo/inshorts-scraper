IT giant Infosys has agreed to pay $1 million (â‚¹6.4 crore) to New York state to settle a visa violation case. Infosys was accused of unlawfully obtaining temporary visitor visas, instead of the more difficult H-1B visas required by foreigners to work in the US. By doing so, Infosys employed foreign workers without paying the prevailing wages or taxes owed.
