Jet Airways has asked junior pilots to furnish surety bonds worth up to ₹1 crore and serve the airline for at least five to seven years, union officials said. This comes after junior pilots were asked to take 10 days off monthly, which would result in around 30% pay cut. The airline has “unilaterally” decided on salary cuts, officials stated.
