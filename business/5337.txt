The government is planning a national "no-fly" list to keep unruly passengers off flights, MoS for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha has said. Defending the decision to revoke the ban on Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, Sinha tweeted, "A flying ban is meant to prevent future unruly behaviour, not to punish past behaviour. We now have an undertaking for future behaviour."
