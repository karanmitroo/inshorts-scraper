Telecommunications firm Bharti Airtel on Monday said its mobile commerce subsidiary Airtel M Commerce Services, has received payments bank licence from the RBI. The subsidiary, which operates under the name of Airtel Money, received in-principle approval from RBI in 2015 to start operations as a payment bank. Notably, Idea Cellular and Vodafone had earlier received approval to form payment banks.
