A US man, who claimed to be an ex-employee of fast-food chain McDonald's, took to Twitter to share some photos of a slimy substance that he said was found inside the restaurant's ice cream machine. He later claimed to have lost his job because of his revelations and admitted that he was planning to leave the job anyway.
