The online music streaming service, Dhingana, has decided to shut down its operations after it apparently ran into problems with music licensing fees - which are often hiked unexpectedly by music labels. Dhingana had received $7 million in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners. Last year, Flipkart had pulled down its music store ‘Flyte’ in the face of declining revenue.
