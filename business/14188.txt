A US jury on Friday ordered Apple to pay the University of Wisconsin (UW) $234 million for illegal use of the latterâ€™s patented technology in some of its iPhone and iPad models. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) had sued Apple in January 2014 for infringement of its 1998 patent for improving the performance of computer processors.
