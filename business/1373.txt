Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook, are believed to have become the world's first Bitcoin billionaires. The pair received $65 million settlement from Facebook and used $11 million of that money to invest in Bitcoin in 2013. Since then, the cryptocurrency has surged by almost 10,000%, making the 36-year-old brothers billionaires.
