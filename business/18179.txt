RBI-sponsored professional forecasters Monday scaled down India's growth projection for 2013-14 to 4.8% from 5.7% estimated earlier. "The slowdown, which is lower than 5% growth registered during 2012-13, is result of global cyclic conditions worsened by domestic factors", RBI said. A modest recovery is likely in second half of 2013-14 because of the expected agricultural growth and increase in exports.
