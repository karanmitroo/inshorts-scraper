Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said GST Council could consider merging slabs of 12% and 18%, and cutting the number of items taxed at 28%. He added that the speed of rationalisation of GST rates will depend on how revenues stabilise. Earlier, GST on 178 goods was reduced to 18% from 28%, leaving only 50 items in the highest slab.
