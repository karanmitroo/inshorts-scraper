White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro has said if India lowers the tariffs imposed on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, it could result in more foreign investments in the country. "If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less, while Harley will sell more...and invest more," he stated.
