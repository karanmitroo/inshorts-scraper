Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has asked the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to consider service charge by hotels as income while assessing the tax returns. He said renowned hotels and restaurants have complied with the guidelines but consumer complaints are still being received. Notably, guidelines were issued in April 2017 that made payment of service charge voluntary.
