Fast-food giant McDonald's is temporarily shutting 43 of its 55 outlets in Delhi from Thursday. This is because the “eating house licences” of the outlets have expired. Over reports saying the shutdown will result in loss of 1,700 jobs, McDonald's said the employees of affected restaurants will be retained and salaries will be paid to them during the suspension period.
