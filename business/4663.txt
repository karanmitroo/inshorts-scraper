A video on Facebook shows a shopper hurling racial slurs at black and Latino customers in a US Walmart store. The video shows a white woman pushing a cart and telling a Latina to “go back to where you came from”. When a black woman told the shopper to “stop being ignorant", she used a racist term for her.
