Former Chairman of UK roadside repair firm AA, Bob Mackenzie, fired for assaulting a colleague, blamed alcohol and pills for the attack, adding he should still qualify for payouts close to £70 million (over ₹600 crore). One of Mackenzie's friends said he was under a lot of pressure, and stress was "getting to him" in the weeks before the attack.
