US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order to curb regulations and help businesses, reports said. The measure directs federal agencies to create "regulatory reform" task forces which will evaluate federal rules and recommend whether to keep, repeal or change them. Trump claimed that "excessive regulation is killing jobs" and "driving companies out of US like never before".
