Qantas Airways CEO Alan Joyce was addressing around 500 people at a business breakfast in Australia when a man shoved a pie in his face. The attacker was detained by security while Joyce left the stage to clean his face. After returning on stage, Joyce said, "Now, if there are any more pies can you get it over with now."
