Following Republican Donald Trump's win, billionaire philanthropist George Soros has said US, the worldâ€™s leading democracy, has elected a con artist and would-be dictator as its president. Although, Trump has toned down his rhetoric since his win, he has changed neither his behaviour nor his advisers, he said. Trump's cabinet comprises "incompetent extremists and retired generals," Soros added.
