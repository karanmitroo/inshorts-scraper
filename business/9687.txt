The Delhi High Court on Tuesday ruled in the favour of multi-business conglomerate ITC in a biscuit packet dispute with Britannia. The court has directed Britannia to withdraw its NutriChoice biscuits from the market in four weeks. The two companies were involved in a copyright infringement case where ITC accused Britannia of copying the packaging of one of its products.
