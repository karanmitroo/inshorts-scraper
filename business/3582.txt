Barkha Dutt has slammed her former employer NDTV for calling its new form of journalism 'MoJo' (mobile journalism), which she claimed, appropriates her brand's name. Dutt tweeted she launched Mojo after leaving NDTV and some events have already taken place under the banner. "Isn't it wrong to appropriate someone's brand name & new form of journalism as yours," she tweeted.
