A private equity fund that focuses on oil investments and was previously valued at over $2 billion (â‚¹13,000 crore) is now worth nearly nothing. The fund raised and started investing money in 2013 when oil was at $90, but prices have plunged to $46.54. The fund will leave clients, including major charitable foundations, with at most pennies on the dollar.
