The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a ban on the registration and sale of vehicles compliant with the older Bharat Stage-III (BS-III) emission norms from April 1. The Supreme Court asserted that the health of millions was more important than commercial interests. Notably, more stringent BS-IV norms were introduced in 2010, and a nationwide rollout is expected on April 1.
