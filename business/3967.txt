Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has said that current GST is "imperfect", "a mockery", and should have been delayed by two months. "The aim was that one indirect tax will subsume all other indirect taxes. This GST fails to achieve that," he said. He further added that Congress will press for the reduction in rates and an 18% cap.
