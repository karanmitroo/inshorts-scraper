In order to combat offshore tax evasion, India and the US signed an agreement on Thursday to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).  The move will promote transparency on the tax matters and will facilitate the exchange of information between the two countries from Oct 1. The pact will also help India deal with the black money menace.
