Sunil Mittal-led Airtel has entered into an agreement with Millicom to buy its telecom operations in Rwanda under the Tigo brand. Airtel said the acquisition will make it the second-largest operator in the African country with a revenue market share of over 40%. Notably, Airtel had merged with Tigo in Ghana last month to become the country's second-largest operator.
