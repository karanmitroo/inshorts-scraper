The 114-year-old Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai has got itself trademarked, making it the first building in India to do so, according to reports. The move aims to protect the building's distinctiveness, which was built even before the Gateway of India. The hotel now joins other trademarked properties in the world like the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower.
