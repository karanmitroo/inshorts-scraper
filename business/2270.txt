The RBI is expected to start printing redesigned ₹100 currency notes around April next year, according to reports. The existing ₹100 notes will be withdrawn gradually and will remain valid even after the new ones come into circulation. Reports added that the dimensions of the new notes will not be altered, ensuring ATMs can be compatible from the beginning.
