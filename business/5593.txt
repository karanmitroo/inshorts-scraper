US President Donald Trump's administration has issued a permit to energy company TransCanada to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which had been blocked by Barack Obama. The State Department said the project was in the US national interest. This comes amid environmentalists' objections over the construction of the pipeline, which would carry over 8 lakh barrels of oil a day.
