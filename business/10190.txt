Global oil prices rose about 2% on Friday, clinching its biggest weekly gains since April. This comes after Saudi Arabia said oil producers would discuss potential action to stabilize oil prices. The prices also shot up after data showed that US oil drillers added rigs for a seventh straight week, the longest recovery in the rig count in two years.
