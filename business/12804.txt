Petroleum major BP plc on Tuesday reported an annual loss of $6.5 billion for 2015, its worst in at least 20 years. It registered an underlying replacement cost profit of $196 million against $2.2 billion during the corresponding period last year. The company also announced 3,000 job cuts. The fall is attributed to the persistent fall in global crude prices.
