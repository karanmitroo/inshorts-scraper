IMF chief Christine Lagarde said on Sunday that US Federal Reserve's plan to increase interest rates, at a time when other countries are reducing rates, could make emerging economies vulnerable. Lagarde added that the world economy had not fully recovered yet and global growth was still slow due to high debt, unemployment and lack of investment.
