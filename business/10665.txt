The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday arrested Jignesh Shah, ex-chairman of Financial Technologies, in a nearly â‚¹5,600 crore National Spot Exchange commodity exchange fraud. Shah was reportedly arrested for non-cooperation with investigative processes. The NSEL scam broke out in 2013, when two dozen borrowers failed to make pay-ins after NSEL was asked to suspend trading of paired contracts.
