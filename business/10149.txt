The Benami Transactions Amendment Act directs that people holding tax-evasive 'benami' properties will get up to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and fine. A 'benami' transaction is a transaction where a property is held by one person but has been paid by another. The bill aimed at checking black money has been reportedly given assent by the President on Tuesday.
