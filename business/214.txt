Punjab National Bank has responded to fraud-accused jeweller Nirav Modi's letter asking him to come up with a "concrete and implementable plan" to repay dues. It also said the bank followed lawful avenues available under the law of the land to recover dues. Nirav Modi had said that PNB closed all recovery options by going public and destroying his brand.
