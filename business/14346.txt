E-commerce website Flipkart will reportedly set up its largest warehouse in Telangana. The decision comes after Karnataka — where Flipkart already has three warehouses — refused to relax norms for e-commerce business in the state. The 16th in the country, the warehouse will be spread over 2.2 lakh square feet, and is expected to create 2,000 jobs directly.
