Singapore's Deputy PM Tharman Shanmugaratnam has said there hasn't been a strong case yet to ban cryptocurrency trading in the country. He said, "Cryptocurrencies are an experiment. The number...of cryptocurrencies is growing internationally. It's too early to say if they'll succeed." He added that Singapore's central bank is closely studying cryptocurrencies and the potential risks they pose.
