After a video of a white woman hurling racial slurs at black and Latino customers in a Walmart store surfaced online, the company in a tweet said it has "no tolerance" for such behaviour. The shopper told a Latina to "leave America". When a black woman told the shopper to "stop being ignorant", she used a racist term for her.
