E-commerce marketplace Snapdeal is reportedly looking to team with BPO providers, intending to outsource its call centre services as its growth escalates. The company had an in-house call centre but its increasing operations now call for better customer support. Like its rival Flipkart, Snapdeal is reportedly eyeing a hybrid structure of in-house and outsourced service providers.
