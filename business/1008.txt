A Delhi court has declared businessman Vijay Mallya a proclaimed offender for evading summons in a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) violation case. The court observed that Mallya had not appeared before the court within 30 days and no representation was made on his behalf. The court had issued an open-ended non-bailable warrant against him in April last year.
