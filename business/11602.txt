The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday cut its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75%. This is the central bank's first rate cut in a year which reportedly seeks to restrain a rising currency and insulate the economy from disinflation. Notably, the Australian government is presenting its budget on the same day.
