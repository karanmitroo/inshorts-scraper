French security researcher Robert Baptiste used a common hacking technique to access a database containing information about 47,000 past and present BSNL employees. He said all the issues were disclosed to BSNL privately and fixed during the weekend. Notably, the vulnerability was first discovered in 2016 by an Indian, Sai Krishna Kothapalli, who claims BSNL did not respond to him.
