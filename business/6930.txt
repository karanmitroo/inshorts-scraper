Former BBC weatherman Michael Fish has joked that his weather forecasts are better than those of the Bank of England, after the bank's Chief Economist Andrew Haldane said the bank had a 'Michael Fish moment' with its Brexit predictions. The weatherman had become infamous for predicting there would be no hurricane, shortly before a huge hurricane hit England in 1987.
