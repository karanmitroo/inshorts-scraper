India's retail inflation eased to a two-year low in the month of November to 3.63%, according to government data released on Tuesday. The decline in inflation was attributed to the demonetisation of high-value currency notes, which led to a plunge in farm product prices across the country. Further, food inflation fell to 2.11% in November, down from 3.32% in October.
