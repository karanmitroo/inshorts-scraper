Scandinavia's largest bank Nordea Bank's $37 billion fund manager Robert Naess has said that Apple is "boring" to buy as its price has gone down and the risk is lower. He pointed out that the company's uninterrupted sales growth for 13 years ended in 2016. Notably, Naess started buying Apple stocks this year and now owns 2% in Apple.
