Reliance Communications has rejected rating cuts by Moody's and Fitch, disagreeing with their assessment that it could struggle to reduce its debt. Earlier, RCom said it won a seven-month reprieve from lenders on loan obligations to complete two deals that would lower debt by 60%. The agencies, however, warned RCom would still have â‚¹20,000 crore in debt after the deals.
