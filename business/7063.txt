Nestlé’s UK and Ireland CEO Fiona Kendrick said that the four-fingered version of the KitKat chocolate biscuit bar would not be downsized to three fingers to cut Brexit-related costs. “Not while I’m sitting here as chairman and CEO,” Kendrick said. Earlier, makers of Toblerone said they were widening gaps between the chocolate bar's triangular chunks to avoid increasing its price.
