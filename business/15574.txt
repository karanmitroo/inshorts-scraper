Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm launched its first product, a messaging and calling app called Jio Chat. The application, available on iOS and Android, also offers video calling facilities to users, and will also send messages in the SMS format to unregistered users. Brand development through Jio Chat will pave the way for other applications by the operator.
