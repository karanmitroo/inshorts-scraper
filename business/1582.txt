The RBI on Friday cancelled a bond sale via Open Market Operations (OMO) worth â‚¹10,000 crore. The central bank said the sale was withdrawn due to "recent market developments and based on a fresh review of the current and evolving liquidity conditions." This comes after Moody's Investors Service upgraded India's sovereign rating to Baa2 from its lowest investment grade (Baa3).
