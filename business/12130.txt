Japan-based tyre company Yokohama Rubber has reached an agreement to fully acquire Netherlands-based Alliance Tire Group (ATG) for $1.2 billion, Yokohama said. Currently, Yokohama does not manufacture tyres for agricultural or forestry machines and the acquisition will strengthen its product lineup in commercial tyres, it added. ATG operates in 120 countries, focussing on North America and Europe.
