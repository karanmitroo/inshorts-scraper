Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian on Thursday said he was "appalled" after Qatar Airways disparaged American flight attendants as grandmothers. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker had said, "you are always being served by grandmothers at American carriers." Although he later apologised, Bastian called the apology "woefully inadequate" and claimed Al Baker wants to "play by his own rules."
