The BSE Sensex extended gains for the second consecutive week, during which it crossed the 21,000 mark, on strong buying triggered by a host of factors and exit polls that predicted good show by BJP. The index surged 205 points to close on a five-week high of 20,996.53, on persistent foreign capital inflows and better-than-expected Q2 growth in India's GDP.
