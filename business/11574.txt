Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday filed a $43.5 billion lawsuit against Brazilian mining company Samarco and its founders Vale and BHP Billiton, for a 2015 dam burst. The burst had killed 19 people and polluted a major river. The damages were calculated based on the cost estimation of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the US, prosecutors said.
