Fox News parent 21st Century Fox said it will investigate a sexual harassment claim against TV anchor Bill O'Reilly, who saw several companies pull their ads from his news show. A woman claimed O'Reilly revoked an offer to secure her a job on the network after she declined his invitation to join him in his hotel suite in 2013.
