US retailer Costco has been ordered to pay $19.4 million (â‚¹124 crore) in damages to jewellery maker Tiffany & Co, over illegal sale of counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the "Tiffany" name. The judge also permanently barred Costco from selling anything that Tiffany did not make as "Tiffany" products. Costco had argued that "Tiffany" had become a generic term.
