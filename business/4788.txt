A Ryanair passenger, who spilled a hot cup of tea and scalded herself, has won £9,000 (₹7.4 lakh) in damages. She claimed the flight attendant didn't secure the lid properly and it popped off when she lifted it. The shock of the lid coming off caused her to drop the drink, and the hot water burned her stomach and thigh.
