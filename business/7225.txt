Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry, who quit from all Tata Group companies, revealed that the group's threatening attitude made him decide to quit. "The platform has to change to the legal side to ensure we protect the shareholders," Mistry said. He added that governance issues were in the group for more than six months or close to a year.
