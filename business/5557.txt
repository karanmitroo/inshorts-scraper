TV news anchor Arnab Goswami has said he was told he could not do the programme two days before leaving Times Now. "18th November was my last day, I was not allowed to enter my own studio," Goswami added. "When you build an institution and are not allowed to enter your own studio, you feel sad," the journalist further said.
