Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows increased by 18% year-on-year to $26.51 billion during January-September, compared to $28.78 billion in the entire 2014 and $22 billion in 2013. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has projected that “FDI will grow by 40-45% in 2016 despite the global slowdown” on the back of reforms made by the government this year.
