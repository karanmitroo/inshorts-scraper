State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has removed the name of ex-PM Rajiv Gandhi from its newly built corporate office in Delhi and has changed it to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Urja Bhawan. The name Rajiv Gandhi Urja Bhawan was given to it by the then PM Manmohan Singh in 2007. The decision was taken to honour Upadhyaya, said ONGC.
