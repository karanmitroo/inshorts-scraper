Former RBI Governor D Subbarao on Monday said that investment is the most important factor to ensure economic growth in the country. He said, "[In] a situation where you have such low real investment... you cannot sustain seven plus per cent growth." He further said that growth dropped after the global financial crisis because investment had dropped.
