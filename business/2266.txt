The fifth biggest airline in the UK, Monarch Airlines, has ceased trading, resulting in three lakh future bookings being cancelled. Over 1 lakh customers have been left overseas, although the UK government has ordered that planes kept on standby ensure that citizens are brought home. Monarch recently reported huge financial losses, partly blamed on terror fears and the weak pound.
