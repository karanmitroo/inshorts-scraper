The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India on Friday said that delay in the completion of 442 Railways projects has resulted in a cost overrun of ₹1.07 lakh crore. “Projects were delayed due to delay in preparation/sanction of estimate and delay in acquisition of land... The physical progress was also slow,” CAG said in its report to the Parliament.
