The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is probing whether $505 billion was siphoned out of India illegally between 2004 and 2013. A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) earlier ordered the probe. The SIT cited a report which claimed India had the fourth largest outflow of black money globally during the period, at an outflow of $51 billion annually.
