Fast food outlets, including McDonald's and KFC, will no longer be able to bring foreign workers into Australia on the 457 visa, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has said. Announcing that he will end the 2012 Fast Food Industry Labour Agreement, Dutton said, "Australian workers...must be given priority." Notably, employers commonly use the 457 visa to sponsor overseas workers.
