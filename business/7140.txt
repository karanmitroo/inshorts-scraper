As many as 10 positions of non-official directors and the position of a deputy governor remain vacant on Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s central board. The deputy governor post fell vacant after Urjit Patel was appointed as RBI Governor in September. This comes at a time when the central bank is engaged in demonetisation-related activities following the November 8 announcement.
