After the last reduction in mid-April, petrol prices have been slashed by Rs. 1.09, whereas diesel prices were hiked by 50 paise. The combined effect of the depreciation in INR-USD exchange rate and downward trend in petrol prices is ascribed as the reduction cause, while price diesel is hiked to curb losses. The revised rates will be effective from midnight.
