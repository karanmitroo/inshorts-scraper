JSW Steel reported a net loss of ₹932 crore for the quarter ended December following a one-time charge of ₹2,122 crore on impairment of assets. The steelmaker had reported a ₹329 crore profit in the year-ago quarter. Amid weakening sales and high debt, JSW Steel wrote off the 'goodwill charge', where it had overpaid for assets using overpriced stocks.
