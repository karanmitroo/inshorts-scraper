Retail giant and US' largest company by revenue Walmart on Tuesday announced that it is partnering with Google to enable voice shopping through Google's virtual assistant. This will allow users in the US to order Walmart products just by speaking to the Google Home voice-controlled speaker. The service will compete with Amazon's Alexa voice-shopping platform.
