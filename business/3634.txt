US food chain Chipotle is facing class-action lawsuit by a shareholder for its alleged inability to keep restaurants clean. This comes after a Virginia restaurant was temporarily shut because of suspected norovirus outbreak, and after Texas customers complained of rodents dropping from ceilings. The shareholder claimed Chipotle made misleading statements about resolving health issues from 2015.
