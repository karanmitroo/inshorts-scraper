The World Bank's Chief Economist Paul Romer has said he would recalculate ease of doing business rankings going back at least four years. He personally apologised to Chile for conveying the "wrong impression" after its ranking fell from 34 in 2014 to 57 in 2017. He said Chile's decline was due to methodological changes that could've been politically motivated.
