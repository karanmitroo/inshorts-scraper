Venezuela's state-owned oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela has offered a 9% stake in an oil field to ONGC Videsh, the international arm of India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, according to reports. This comes as Venezuela seeks to support its energy industry, which has been hit by falling oil prices and is struggling to maintain its investment in oilfields.
