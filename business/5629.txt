The government is focusing on the print and supply of ₹500 and lower denomination notes to avoid accumulation of high-value currency, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said on Tuesday. "The apprehension is being expressed that ₹2,000 notes would again lead to accumulation...that should not happen," he added.
