A Spanish bar published a job advert on Facebook seeking "single, good-looking barmaids without jealous boyfriends." The advert said, "Weâ€™re looking for girls, 18 years plus," adding that job aspirants who did not like the conditions need not apply. After it was slammed for being sexist, the bar apologised, saying the "jealous partner" and wardrobe requirements were for both genders.
