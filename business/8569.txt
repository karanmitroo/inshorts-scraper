India's third-largest telecom operator Idea Cellular on Monday posted an 88% decline in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September to ₹91.4 crore, as against the year-ago period. The company's revenue also declined 7.6% to ₹9,300 crore. The fall was attributed to cheaper voice and data plans rolled out in a bid to counter new competition.
