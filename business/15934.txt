E-retailers Flipkart and Amazon have sparked a row by selling books on sex determination of foetus. The book "...explains the simple, noninvasive method and presents detailed steps to take to conceive a child of a specific gender," Amazon said. However, both the retailers removed the books from their portals soon after questions were raised about the sale of the book.
