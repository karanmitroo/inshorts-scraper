State-owned Air India is reportedly hiring 800 new cabin crew and about 250 pilots this year, which will increase its staff cost by Rs 100 crore to reach Rs 3,200 crore this fiscal year. The airline is surviving on bailout money but will have to bear the inflated bill seeing acute staff shortage and increasing Dearness allowance in their pay.
