Snapchat's parent company Snap, which launched its IPO on Thursday, saw its shares surge to raise its market capitalisation to around $32 billion. This is more than the market capitalisation of Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari ($12.46 billion), which went public in 2015. Notably, Snap has also become more valuable than hotel company Hilton.
