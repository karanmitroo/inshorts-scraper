Under a latest offer by IndiGo, registered IndiGo users can block a seat on any IndiGo flight first and confirm it later. Customers can hold the booking for up to 6 hours, during which the ticket price would remain the same. The customer will get a PNR which will automatically get cancelled if payment is not made within  six hours.
