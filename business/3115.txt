UK supermarket worker Harry Brown found a missing four-year-old girl, held captive by her estranged father Virgil Henley, from 8000 kilometres away. Brown was contacted by the girl's grandparents on Facebook, who knew he was friends with the girl's father. He then convinced her captor to give out the address by offering a free pizza to his US motel room.
