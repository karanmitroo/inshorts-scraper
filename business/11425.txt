Bicycle maker Hero Cycles has filed a lawsuit against Avon Cycles, alleging piracy of the registered design of one of its cycle models, in a district court in Ludhiana. Hero alleged that the design of Avon Cycles' AVON X-Track is identical to its HERO RX-1. The lawsuit was filed a month after Hero sent a notice to Avon, Hero said.
