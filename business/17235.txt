With accumulated losses of Rs 49k crore, the civil aviation sector is on the verge of collapse, aviation minister Ashok Raju told PM Narendra Modi Saturday. Raju pointed out that poor returns from airports, burgeoning costs and a tax structure was burying the sector under debt. Notably, Air India contributes a staggering Rs 30k crore to the total accumulated loss.
