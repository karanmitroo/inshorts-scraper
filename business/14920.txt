Americans applying for unemployment aid dropped to its lowest in 42 years, suggesting a steady labour market and job security. The Labour Department said requests for state unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 255,000 last week, an all-time low since November 1973. The unemployment rate (5.3%) is close to the 5%-5.2% range, considered uniform with full employment.
