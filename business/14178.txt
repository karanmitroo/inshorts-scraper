Courier service company Blue Dart on Thursday introduced a locker service centre in Gurgaon in order to address high failure rates in parcel deliveries (15-18%). Customers who are unavailable for receiving an order would be able to collect it from a locker accessible through a one-time password. The company is planning to launch lockers at “multiple locations across the country”.
