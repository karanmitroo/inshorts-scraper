To counter its rivals, Vistara airlines has brought down its ticket prices by reducing its fares to almost half of what they were last week. A Delhi-Mumbai ticket price booked for a flight a month in advance has been reduced from Rs.10,700 to Rs.5,481. Earlier in January, Air India and other airlines had offered discounts for travel up to April-end.
