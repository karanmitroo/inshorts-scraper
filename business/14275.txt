International Labour Organisation’s Deputy Director General (Policy), Sandra Polaski, has said that India should raise wages in order to safeguard workers and also to boost economic growth. “If you look at a number of successful economies, like China, their mantra for growth during the last 15 years has been to raise wages under government control," she added.
