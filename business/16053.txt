According to sources, taxi service aggregator Olacabs, backed by Japan's SoftBank, is likely to buy rival Taxi-ForSure for about $200 million, to take on competitors like Uber. The deal, if finalised, will be the second-largest buyout in the consumer Internet market, after Flipkart's acquisition of fashion portal Myntra for an estimated $370 million last year.
