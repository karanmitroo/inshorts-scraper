The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that banks can extend their loan repayment period up to five years if 50% of the crop gets damaged due to natural calamities like drought and flood. In case the crop damage is 33%, the loan repayment period can be extended up to two years, which includes one year of moratorium.
