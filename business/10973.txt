The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided to keep the key interest rates steady at 0.25-0.5%. Further, the growth forecast for 2016 and 2017 was brought down by 0.1% to 2%. The UK's possible exit from the European Union affected the decision as it would impact economic and financial conditions in the global markets, the Fed chair Janet Yellen said.
