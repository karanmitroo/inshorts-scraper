US President Donald Trump's wealth has fallen by $100 million (₹645 crore) from the previous year to $2.9 billion. The decrease is driven by a drop in the value of three Trump properties, which aren’t bringing in as much cash as banks that loaned him money had expected. Together, the properties' value has been revised down by $380 million.
