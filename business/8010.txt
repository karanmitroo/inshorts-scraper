Ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry's office on Sunday denied the group's statement that alleged he was seeking to control the main group operating firms to the exclusion of Tata Sons. “Tata Sons statement alludes to Mistry having created a new structure where operating companies were ‘drifting away’. This is furthest from the truth,” its statement read.
