ICICI Bank on Thursday launched a mobile-payment solution, based on Visa’s ‘mVisa’, to enable customers to make cashless payments from their smartphones at physical stores. Customers having the bank’s mobile wallet ‘Pockets’ can pay for a product by scanning its Quick Response code. The service has been introduced in Bengaluru and would be extended to other cities soon, ICICI said.
