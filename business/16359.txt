The government on Wednesday approved promulgation of an ordinance to raise the Foreign Direct Investment cap in the insurance sector to 49% from the current level of 26%. The move came after the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, 2008 could not be passed amid stiff resistance by the opposition parties. The 49% cap would include both FDI and foreign portfolio investments.
