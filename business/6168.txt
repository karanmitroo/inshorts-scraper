Thailand-based paint company TOA Group's founder Prachak Tangkaravakoon has become a billionaire, making him Southeast Asiaâ€™s second paint company billionaire, according to Bloomberg. Prachak's net worth hit $1.4 billion after TOA's value surged due to falling cost of raw materials. Notably, Prachak started the business as a hardware store in 1957 and transitioned to the paint industry in 1964.
