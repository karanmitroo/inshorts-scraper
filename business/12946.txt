RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday asked rich businesses in serious debt to "behave" and not flaunt "massive birthday bashes". "If you are in trouble, you should show that you care by cutting down your expenses", he added. He further said that RBI was giving banks more powers and flexibility to deal with bad loans and recover money.
