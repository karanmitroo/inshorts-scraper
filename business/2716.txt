Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said it's always better to under-promise and over-achieve. "This notion that...we have to say we're the best and there's nobody else like us. Well, that's not true," he said. Stating that India is capable of doing more, Rajan said, "Let us be confident, we can do it...But let us boast only after we've achieved it."
