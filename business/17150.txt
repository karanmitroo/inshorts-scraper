Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, is planning to shut down over 100 Reliance Fresh stores that largely sell fresh produce and groceries. The move comes as the company increases its focus on India's $450 billion wholesale cash-and-carry business. At present, Reliance Retail operates around 550 Reliance Fresh stores.
