In a letter sent to members of the German parliament, Volkswagen has reportedly admitted to rigging 8 million vehicles for cheating diesel emission tests in the European Union. The letter, dated October 2, carries an apology “for the wrongdoing of a few individuals”. Volkswagen’s share price has fallen by more than a third as a result of the emissions scandal.
