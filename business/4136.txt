UK's Queen Elizabeth II is set to receive an income of over £82 million (₹675 crore) after a government decision to increase her funding to cover repairs at Buckingham Palace. The sovereign grant, which is paid 2 years in arrears, will be handed to her in 2019. The pay will fund repairs including replacing ageing electrical wiring and water pipes.
