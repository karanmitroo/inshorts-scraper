The BSE Sensex on Wednesday lost 315.68 points to close at 24,223.32, while the NSE Nifty fell 93.75 points to settle at 7,361.80. Analysts attributed the negative sentiment to a global sell-off triggered by renewed concerns over slowing growth after oil prices dropped below $30 a barrel. The rupee touched a fresh 29-month low of 68.26 against the US dollar.
