Two Indian-Americans have been sentenced to over a year of imprisonment for a credit card fraud involving $200 million (â‚¹1,300 crore) in the US. The accused were indicted in 2013 for a scheme to fabricate 7,000 false identities to obtain tens of thousands of credit cards. They then used the cards, based on fake credit history, but didn't repay debts.
