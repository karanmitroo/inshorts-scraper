Canadian authorities have issued recall of a brand of gin after it was discovered that some bottles may contain 77% alcohol rather than 40% listed on the bottle. Liquor authorities said that an investigation on Bombay Sapphire London Dry Gin revealed it was "not safe for consumption". Bacardi Canada, which manages the product's distribution, said it doesn't recommend its consumption.
