Defence sector will be the largest business area for Reliance Group, with opportunities worth ₹1 lakh crore per annum in acquisitions for the armed forces, Chairman Anil Ambani said. Reliance Group’s entry into defence sector is driven by policies like 'Make in India', he added. Notably, Reliance Group’s acquisition of Pipavav Shipyard remains India's largest acquisition in the defence sector.
