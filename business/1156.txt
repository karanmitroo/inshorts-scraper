Addressing a gathering of chartered accountants on Friday, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime would get stabilised in the next 18 months. CAs should extend cooperation to erase dualism in organised and unorganised sectors, he added. "Unfortunately, some of you are trying to scare investors away from GST," he further said.
