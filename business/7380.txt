As per reports, the Centre has decided to import two crore kilograms (20,000 tonnes) of currency paper from a clutch of foreign firms to meet the requirement of the country's four security printing presses. The decision was reportedly made on Saturday in a Finance Ministry meeting, chaired by Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das, in wake of the demonetisation move.
