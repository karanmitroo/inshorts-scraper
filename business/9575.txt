Yoga guru and founder of 'Patanjali' Baba Ramdev has said that he will launch 'Paridhaan', an apparel brand that'll include jeans and office wear. He revealed that the idea started with followers asking him for 'Patanjali' yoga wear. "Just because I am a baba does not mean we cannot marry modernity with spirituality, we can make... desi jeans," added Ramdev.
