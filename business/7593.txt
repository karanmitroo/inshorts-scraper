Industrialist JRD Tata, who had founded Air India, vocally opposed the government's decision to nationalise the airline in 1953. Although Tata was against the government's takeover of the airline, he was appointed to head the national carrier. The government also accepted his suggestion of splitting the airline into separate domestic and international businesses. JRD Tata died on 29 November 1993.
