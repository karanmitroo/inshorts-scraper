The steel industry has outstanding loans of around â‚¹3 lakh crore in multiple banks, Steel Minister Birender Singh said in the Lok Sabha. He blamed it on the industry's low profit margins due to the availability of cheap imported steel. To help recover the loans, the RBI is restructuring them and regulations have been imposed on steel imports, he added.
