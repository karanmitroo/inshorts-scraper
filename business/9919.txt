Asia's biggest shipping company China COSCO Holdings posted a first-half loss of $1.1 billion in 2016, reportedly the biggest loss in China's corporate history. The Chinese state-owned company reportedly blames the losses on economic slowdown and excess supply combined with depressed freight prices. Notably, the company had posted a net profit of $295 million in the same period last year.
