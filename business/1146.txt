Ford CEO Jim Hackett has apologised to employees for accusations detailed in The New York Times report that management at two Chicago plants didn't respond adequately to complaints of sexual harassment. Adding that Ford had zero tolerance for harassment, Hackett said, "We don't want you here, and we will move you out for engaging in behaviour like this."
