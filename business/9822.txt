The Jaguar F-Pace launched last year by Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover has become the fastest selling car in the company's history. Around 30,000 models of the British luxury car maker's first-ever SUV have been sold globally since it hit the roads in mid-April. According to the company, about 90% of the buyers of the SUV are new customers.
