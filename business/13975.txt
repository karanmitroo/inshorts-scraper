Taxi aggregator Uber on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Punjab government for implementing a peer-to-peer ride-sharing business model in the state. The pilot project – the first in India – would allow private car owners to register on and operate through the Uber app. The company targets the creation of over 45,000 entrepreneurial opportunities through this business.
