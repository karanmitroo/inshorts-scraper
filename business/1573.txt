Clarifying that the government has not asked RBI to pay any special dividend, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Garg said it is only seeking the ₹13,000 crore surplus lying with the RBI. Adding that the RBI already distributed ₹30,000 crore from its profits, he said the government asked the RBI to transfer the rest it had retained towards risks and reserves.
