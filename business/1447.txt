Jack Bogle, the Founder of US investment management company Vanguard, has warned investors to "avoid bitcoin like the plague". He said, "There is nothing to support bitcoin except the hope that you will sell it to someone for more than you paid for it." Reacting to Bitcoin's recent price surge, Bogle said, "When it gets back to $100, we'll talk."
