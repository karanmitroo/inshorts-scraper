Following Tamil Nadu, traders in Kerala have decided to stop sale of drinks produced by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, to promote local beverages like lime soda. The boycott is in protest against exploitation of groundwater by the companies amid threats of a drought. Around seven lakh shops and traders will join the boycott, which will formally be announced on March 14.
