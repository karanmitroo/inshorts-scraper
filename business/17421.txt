Facebook has said it may consider opening a sales office in China to provide more support to local advertisers who use the website to reach customers overseas. However, there were no comments on how soon it would happen. Facebook currently has a Hong Kong sales office  which deals  with advertisers locally and in mainland China, where its services are blocked.
