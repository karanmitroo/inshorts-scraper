The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday directed Volkswagen to submit an undertaking that it would not sell any vehicle fitted with their 'cheat device' in India. The company has to submit the undertaking by January 11. Volkswagen had earlier admitted to the rigging of some of its diesel cars with a device to falsely manipulate performance statistics during emission testing.
