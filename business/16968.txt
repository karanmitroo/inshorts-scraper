Kingfisher Airlines moved the Delhi HC Tuesday against Punjab National Bank’s notice, which alleged that the carrier wilfully defaulted in payment of outstanding dues of over Rs.770 crore. The bank had also said that if no reply was received within seven-days then the airline and its guarantors would be declared “wilful defaulters”. The matter is listed for hearing on Wednesday.
