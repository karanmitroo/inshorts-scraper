The Chinese government on Saturday announced the country's growth target of 6.5%-7% for 2016, down from an objective of about 7% last year, to meet slower growth targets. Notably, this is the first time that a growth range has been offered since 1995. Also, China recorded a growth of 6.9% last year, its lowest expansion in 25 years.
