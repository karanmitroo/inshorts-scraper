The Cabinet on Wednesday gave a nod to the sale of another 10% stake in Coal India. Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said that the divestment would help raise as much as $3 billion. However, the timing of the latest stake sale will be decided by the Finance Ministry. The government holds about 79% stake in Coal India.
