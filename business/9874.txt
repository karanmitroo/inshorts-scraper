Oil explorers discovered 2.7 billion barrels of new supply in 2015, the smallest amount since 1947, unearthing about a tenth as much oil on average annually since 1960. This reportedly follows drillers cutting exploration budgets after the oil price collapse two years ago. This year could see even lesser discoveries affecting the ability to meet future demand, the report added.
