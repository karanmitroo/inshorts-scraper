Infosys' move to settle the alleged disclosure lapses involving former CFO Rajiv Bansal's severance pact with SEBI is "perfectly fine", the company's former CFO Mohandas Pai has said. Pai disagreed with a whistleblower who asked the regulator to prosecute Infosys' management as well as the board. The whistleblower has argued that a settlement was similar to a "backdoor agreement".
