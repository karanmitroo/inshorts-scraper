Posting a 100-time growth rate in three years, Indian e-tailer Flipkart has hit $1 billion in sales - a feat achieved before its own target of 2015. In 2011, its rate was $10 million, said Sachin Bansal, co-founder, Flipkart. The feat has been achieved by Flipkart in roughly the same time it took online giant Amazon to do in US.
