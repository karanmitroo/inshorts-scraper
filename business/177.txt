The Delhi HC has directed Facebook and YouTube to block weblinks of videos that show PepsiCo's Lay's product in a bad light after videos claimed that the chips contain plastic. The interim order was issued after the company cited its food regulator's licence to argue that the videos' content was baseless. As per the videos, the chips could kill consumers.
