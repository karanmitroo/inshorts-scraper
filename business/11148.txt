The Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry on Friday unveiled unified distribution norms for the selection of LPG distributors. Under this, the earlier policy of having separate LPG dealership norms for rural and urban areas will be replaced with a single policy. Further, 33% of the LPG dealerships will be reserved for women and 3% for specially-abled candidates, it added.
