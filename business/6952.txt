Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance from Japan has announced that it will lay off 34 employees and replace them with an artificial intelligence to calculate payouts. The company said the AI will increase productivity by 30% by reading tens of thousands of medical certificates and factor in the length of hospital stays, medical histories and surgical procedures before calculating payouts.
