The slogan of Nike, 'Just Do It' is inspired by the last words of American murderer Gary Gilmore, as revealed by Dan Wieden, who was responsible for creating the brand's tagline. Gary Gilmore, who was sentenced to death for robbing and murdering two men, said "Let's do it" as his last words. Wieden thus modified these words for the tagline.
