The Information Technology Ministry on Monday said it has given its in-principle approval for 9,020 seats in business process outsourcing (BPO) units in several small cities of the country, including Varanasi, Siliguri, and Patna. "[W]ith BPOs in small towns, people will be able to work without any need to leave their native place," IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.
