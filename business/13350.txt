The World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) talks in Nairobi concluded on Saturday after being extended for an extra day due to a deadlock in discussions. India expressed disappointment over non-reaffirmation of the 2001 Doha mandate which safeguarded developing countries’ interests. However, India’s demand for special safeguards for the protection of farmers against import hikes, was fulfilled.
