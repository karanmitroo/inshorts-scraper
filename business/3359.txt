Patanjali Ayurved ex-CEO SK Patra has said Baba Ramdev once gave 'chyawanprash' worth ₹2 crore to a media house for ₹4 crore of advertising in its newspaper. Adding that Ramdev used to think "advertising is a waste of money", Patra said Ramdev struck the deal on his insistence. "I was amazed at his imaginative style of doing business," Patra noted.
