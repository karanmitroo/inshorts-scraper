The world’s largest seller of luxury goods, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, better known as LVMH, said its revenue grew 16% year-on-year in 2015 to €35.67 billion (approximately ₹2.63 lakh crore). The strength was driven by sales at its fashion and leather division, and occurred despite a challenging global economic environment, especially in China.
