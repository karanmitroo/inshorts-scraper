An Italian woman who ordered her boyfriend's murder through a website and paid a murderer in cryptocurrency Bitcoin has been sentenced to six years imprisonment. The 58-year-old woman had ordered the murder in March but the murder was never carried out. The woman had transferred 4.1 Bitcoin (then worth around $4,000) to the murderer's cryptocurrency wallet.
