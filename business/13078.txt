Credit rating agency, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has said that one month of negative growth of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) should not be interpreted as the end of industrial recovery. The statement comes after Tuesdayâ€™s announcement of a 3.2% contraction of the index in November. Further, Ind-Ra estimated industrial gross value added to grow 7.3% in 2015-16.
