American toy maker Mattel has launched a new campaign called 'Dads Who Play Barbie' under its ongoing 'You Can Be Anything' program. The campaign, developed by BBDO, shows professionals like a firefighter, doctor, and teacher spending time with their daughters. The commercial ends with, "Time spent in her imaginary world is an investment in her real world."
