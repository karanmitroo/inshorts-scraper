US multinational corporation Walmart announced on Friday that it has acquired men's clothing brand Bonobos. Walmart is paying $310 million (nearly ₹2,000 crore) in cash for the deal, slightly more than Bonobos' $300 million (₹1,930 crore) valuation when it raised $55 million in 2014. Bonobos started by selling online but has since expanded and opened several brick-and-mortar showrooms.
