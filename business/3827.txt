German carmaker Daimler was accused of selling over ten lakh cars with excessive emissions in Europe and the US, a German newspaper reported on Wednesday. The cars reportedly include Mercedes-Benz models sold in Europe and the US between 2008 and 2016. Notably, prosecutors searched Daimler sites two months ago following allegations of false advertising and possible manipulation of exhaust systems.
