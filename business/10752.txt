India's foreign exchange reserves dropped $3.03 billion to $360.79 billion in the week ended June 24, according to RBI data. The dip was due to a decline in the foreign currency assets amid volatility in currency markets after the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Earlier in June, the reserves had reached an all-time high of $363.826 billion.
