Banking major Barclays' CEO Jes Staley has admitted he made a mistake in his attempts to unmask a whistleblower but said he didn't offer his resignation over the scandal. “As I’ve said I made a mistake. I was trying to protect a vulnerable colleague," he stated. Staley had tried to identify the author of a letter involving a senior executive.
