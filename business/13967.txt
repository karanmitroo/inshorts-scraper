Gold prices plunged by ₹245 and dropped to a two-week low to fall under the ₹27k-mark to ₹26,830 per 10 grams. The fall was said to be a result of the yellow metal hitting a three-week low in the overseas markets and weakened demand from jewellers. Silver also fell by ₹735 to dip below the ₹37k-mark to ₹36,630 per kg.
