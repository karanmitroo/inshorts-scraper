Indiaâ€™s onion output is estimated to touch a new record at 203 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June) as favourable weather and better prices boosted acreage and crop yields, National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation said. The previous record was 194 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 before it dropped last year due to poor rains.
