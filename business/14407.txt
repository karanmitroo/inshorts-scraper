Nestle India on Wednesday said before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), that it was being “singled out” by the government in the Maggi ban case as no action was being taken against companies manufacturing similar products. In response, NCDRC, India's apex consumer body, issued a notice to the government, seeking its response by October 8.
