The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has opened a criminal inquiry into Tata Steel's operations, over allegations of falsifying certificates on steel composition, according to a report by ‘Daily Telegraph’. The SFO confirmed opening a probe in December 2015 but declined to comment further. This comes at a time when Tata Steel is seeking to sell its loss-making UK businesses.
