Global ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) on Wednesday said that the “alarming” outlook for certain emerging markets (EMs) is more worrying than China’s economic slowdown. S&P highlighted the risks faced by countries with heavy dependence on production of raw materials and prices of commodities, especially oil. In particular, it called the situation of recession-hit Brazil “extremely serious”.
