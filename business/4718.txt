UK's biggest buy-to-let landlord, Fergus Wilson, who banned coloured people from renting his properties because of "the curry smell" at the end of their tenancy, is now facing legal action. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is seeking a court injunction against the millionaire. It is also investigating allegations that Wilson has banned domestic abuse victims from renting his properties.
