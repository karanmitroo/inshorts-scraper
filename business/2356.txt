US bank JPMorgan Chase has been ordered by a jury to pay more than $4 billion in damages for mishandling the $19 million estate of a former American Airlines executive, Max Hopper. The jury found that bank committed fraud, breached its fiduciary duty and broke a fee agreement. However, JPMorgan said it is "highly confident" the jury verdict won't stand.
