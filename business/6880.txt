Former Governor YV Reddy on Monday said that RBI is facing 'reputational' risk and its identity as an institution has been damaged. Over comments against RBI by international agencies, Reddy said, "If this is happening in international opinion I would say this is a national problem now." Black money cannot be eliminated only by destroying cash through demonetisation, he added.
