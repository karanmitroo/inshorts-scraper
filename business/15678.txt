The country's biggest spectrum auction ended today after 19 days and 115 rounds of bidding, garnering Rs 109,874 crores. The large figure has increased fears of a rate hike by telecom operators in the coming months. The spectrum auction in 2010 had garnered Rs 1,06,000 crores, including Rs 30,000 crores from BSNL & MTNL who didn't participate this time.
