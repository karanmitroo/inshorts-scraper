IT services company iGate has paid its former CEO Phaneesh Murthy an amount of $4.6 million, to settle the defamation and breach-of-contract case that he had filed against the company. Murthy was fired from the company in May 2013 for allegedly not disclosing his relationship with the firm's investor relations head Araceli Roiz.
