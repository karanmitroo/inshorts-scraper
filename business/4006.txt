Credit rating agency Moody's on Sunday said GST will be positive for India's rating as it will lead to higher GDP growth in the medium term. GST will improve ease of doing business and enhance India's attractiveness as a foreign investment destination, Moody's VP William Foster said. It will support higher government revenue generation through improved tax compliance, he added.
