Sahara Group has served a legal notice to Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, the marketers of brand Amul, on an Amul topical titled - 'Besahara Parivar?'. The ad shows Sahara employees begging for money collection. Sahara has found the ad objectionable, as it takes pot shots at the idea of money collection from Sahara employees for Subrata Roy's bail.
