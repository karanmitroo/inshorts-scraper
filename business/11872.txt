The Bank of England said that the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union could harm economic growth and impact the pound and other assets. "A vote to leave could have significant implications for asset prices, in particular the exchange rate," the minutes of the bank's latest policy meeting said. The bank also left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%.
