Animal rights group PETA has slammed luxury department store Harrods for selling a stuffed toy worth over â‚¹1 lakh made from real rabbit fur. The toy uses a rabbit breed which is specifically bred for its fur and meat. In 2013, Harrods won a legal fight against fur trade protesters who demonstrated outside the store during a Lady Gaga performance.
