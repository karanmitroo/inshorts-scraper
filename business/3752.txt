Liquor firm Diageo will reportedly hold back the remaining $35 million (₹225 crore) of the $75 million it had agreed to pay Vijay Mallya as part of a settlement. It will instead seek to recover dues from him. These include $135 million (₹869 crore) that Diageo gave to Standard Chartered Bank as conditional guarantee for liabilities of a Mallya-affiliated company.
