With a cleanup motive, Reliance communications has deactivated over 10-million of its subscribers in September who were unprofitable and at the lowest end of the ARPU (average revenue per user) range. The cleanup is expected to lower the costs for the telco and raise service standards for existing customers. RCom had deactivated about 30-million subscribers in the second-half of 2012.
