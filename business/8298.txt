BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday called Tata Sons Chairman Ratan Tata as the most corrupt chairman in Tata Group's history. Ratan Tata was not actually a Tata as his father was an adopted child, Swamy alleged. Tata was doing a 'grave injustice' and it must have been Ratan Tataâ€™s jealousy that prompted Cyrus Mistry's sacking, he added.
