The RBI has asked the public to make it a habit to examine ₹500 and ₹1,000 denomination notes before accepting them in the usual course of transactions and subject them to “careful scrutiny”. “[U]nscrupulous elements are putting into circulation fake Indian currency notes...taking advantage of the gullible and unsuspecting nature of some members of the public,” the RBI said.
