According to global financial services company Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML), India's economy is recovering at a pace that is slower-than-expected. However, the company also said that India's pace is enough for it to become the second largest emerging market after China, overtaking Russia and Brazil. BofA-ML cut India's growth forecast to 5.5% from 6% for the current fiscal.
