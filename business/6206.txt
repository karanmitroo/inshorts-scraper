India's retail inflation eased to a five-year low of 3.17% in January, as against 3.41% in the previous month, due to a fall in food prices, government data released on Monday stated. This was also attributed to weak demand by consumers due to the cash crunch following demonetisation. Further, food inflation fell to 0.53% in January, from 1.37% in December.
