The price of digital currency Bitcoin crossed $3,000 (₹1.9 lakh) for the first time ever on Sunday, helped by increased demand from Asia-based investors. The new peak continues a surge that began in early May, when a Bitcoin was worth nearly $1,400 (₹90,000). Earlier, Bitcoin prices had tumbled after billionaire Mark Cuban said it was in a bubble.
