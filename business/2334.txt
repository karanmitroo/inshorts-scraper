Consumer goods company Unilever, which created KJU line of body soaps for the Chinese market, has said the name has nothing to do with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. "It was only after we trademarked it that I realized that it also stood for Kim Jong-un, but never mind," the company's head of personal care Alan Jope said.
