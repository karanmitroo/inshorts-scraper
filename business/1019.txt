Former RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has said, "It is premature to take a decisive action on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies." He said that Bitcoin is a technology innovation and regulation should not choke its growth in India. "We need to strike a balance between regulation and growth of cryptocurrencies," he added.
