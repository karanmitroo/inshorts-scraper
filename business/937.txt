Union Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has said that permitting 49% foreign direct investment (FDI) in Air India does away with the preferential treatment that was extended to it. He said this brings the airline at par with other carriers. The decision has provided that substantial ownership and effective control of the airline is vested in an Indian national, he added.
