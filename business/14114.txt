Citibank on Wednesday slashed the 2016 global economic growth forecast to 2.8% against its previous forecast of 2.9%- its fifth consecutive downgrade. "Adjusted for mis-measurement of China's GDP data, 'true' global growth will probably be below 2.5% in both 2015 and 2016 (versus the 3% long-run norm). Risks probably remain to the downside", Citi said in a statement.
