Leaving direct taxes untouched, finance minister P Chidambaram Monday slashed excise duty on cars, two-wheelers, cellphones, and capital goods and consumer durables. Presenting the interim Budget, he also announced the implementation of the long-standing One Rank, One Pension for defence forces, and a subsidy scheme on education loans taken before 31-March-2009 - a move that will help 9 lakh students.
