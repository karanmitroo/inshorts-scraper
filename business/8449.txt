After being removed as Tata Sons Chairman, Cyrus Mistry in his letter said that in 2011, he had "politely declined" the post. "I was approached by both Ratan Tata and Lord Bhattacharya individually to be a candidate for the position," he wrote. "I was asked to reconsider" when the company was unable to find a suitable candidate, Mistry added.
