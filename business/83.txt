Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp has reportedly refused to share user data with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on grounds of privacy. This comes after the market regulator asked WhatsApp to provide information over leak of financial details of 24 companies on the instant messaging app. WhatsApp was earlier accused of sharing its user data with Facebook post merger.
