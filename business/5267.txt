United Airlines customers have slammed the company on social media, with some calling for a boycott, while others have posted photos of their cut-up United MileagePlus credit cards (a loyalty programme). This came after a video of police officers dragging a passenger from an overbooked United flight surfaced online. United lost nearly $1 billion in valuation after the incident.
