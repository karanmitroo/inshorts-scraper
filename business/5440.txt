Shares of Infosys tanked by over 1% on Monday after Co-founder Narayana Murthy said the salary hike of COO UB Pravin Rao approved by the board in February was not “proper”. The hike will "erode the trust and faith of the employees in the management”, Murthy stated. Earlier, Infosys Co-founders had also raised questions over CEO Vishal Sikka's pay hike.
