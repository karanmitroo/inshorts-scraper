The Delhi High Court on Tuesday rejected Cairn India's plea seeking permission to export surplus crude from Barmer oil fields in Rajasthan. Under a production sharing contract between Cairn India and state explorer ONGC, the former can sell surplus crude oil only to the government and its nominees. Cairn had earlier said that domestic refineries were not offering competitive prices.
