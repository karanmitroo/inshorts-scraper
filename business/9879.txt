The State Bank of Travancore Employees Union on Monday urged the Centre not to go ahead with the merger of SBT and other associate banks with SBI, and asked RBI and SEBI to intervene. The government should consider the views of the people, and the stakeholders, the union stated. The SBI had earlier approved the merger with its associate banks.
