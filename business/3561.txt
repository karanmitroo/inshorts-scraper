Infosys Co-Chairman Ravi Venkatesan has said the company certainly wouldn't want to label Co-founder Narayana Murthy as a shareholder activist, and instead considers him a "well-wisher". "I would like to see him as a well-wisher of Infosys, which he has been, and will continue to be," he stated. This comes after Murthy criticised Infosys board over falling corporate governance standards.
