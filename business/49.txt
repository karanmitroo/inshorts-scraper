Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani has said there will be changes in the present flexi-fare system in premium trains benefiting both passengers and Railways. Under the flexi-fare system, the fares will increase 10% for every 10% berths sold. Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier said that a system was being considered where fares are decided based on season and demand.
