The Centre on Friday told the Supreme Court it won't be able to secure the extradition of liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who owes over â‚¹9,000 crore to banks, before January 2018. The Centre's response came after SC said it cannot sentence Mallya in a contempt of court case in his absence. Notably, Mallya had fled to UK in March 2016.
