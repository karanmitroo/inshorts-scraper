The RBI has reportedly reduced its order for printing bank notes in this financial year to 21 billion pieces. This is the lowest in five years compared to 28 billion pieces last year. This is reportedly due to lack of space in the RBI vaults and currency chests as the vaults are piled up with scrapped ₹500 and ₹1000 notes.
