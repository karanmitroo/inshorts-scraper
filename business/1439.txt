Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that improvement in GDP growth to 6.3% in the September quarter is "a pause in the declining trend of the last five quarters". He further said the growth is far below the potential of a well-managed Indian economy. "We should wait for growth rates over next 3-4 quarters before reaching a conclusion," he added.
