Vedanta Group firm THL Zinc has sought a rollover of a $1.25 billion loan taken from Vedanta Resources' subsidiary Cairn India that was supposed to be repaid by July 2016, Cairn India said. Rollover of loan refers to the payment of a fee to delay its repayment. Vedanta Resources had proposed merger of Vedanta Ltd with Cairn India in 2015.
