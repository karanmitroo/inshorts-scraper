Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday said the government is considering a proposal to remove subsidy on cooking gas (LPG) for those earning above a specified threshold. Following the government’s urging, only 42.5 lakh of almost 15 crore domestic LPG consumers have voluntarily given up their subsidy. “Subsidies should be better targeted,” Pradhan said.
