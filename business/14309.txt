Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurveda will come up with its instant noodles next week, which would be priced at â‚¹15. "It will be made from whole wheat flour (atta), not like noodles of other companies which are made up of maida and has only 10 percent atta," Ramdev said. He also claimed that it will have 'no added MSG and lead'.
