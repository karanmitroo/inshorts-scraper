Mahindra & Mahindra on Thursday said the Supreme Court's "unexpected ruling" that bans BS III vehicles from April 1 has "perplexed the industry". It further said the ban will have a one-time material impact on the company. Notably, auto firms are stuck with a stock of over 8 lakh such vehicles valued at up to â‚¹20,000 crore after the ban.
