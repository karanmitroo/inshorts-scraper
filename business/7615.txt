Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in public sector banks have increased by nearly ₹80,000 crore to reach ₹6,30,323 crore as on September 30. “The government has taken sector-specific measures (infrastructure, power, road textiles, steel etc.) where incidence of NPA is high,” an official said. Notably, around 44% of the total loans given to the iron and steel sector have gone bad.
