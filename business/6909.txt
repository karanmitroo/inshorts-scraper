In a bid to analyse banking transactions before demonetisation, the I-T Department has asked banks to report cash deposits in savings accounts between April 1-November 9, 2016. Further, banks have been directed to ask account holders, who did not furnish PAN or Form-60 (for those without PAN) at the time of opening accounts, to do so by February 28, 2017.
