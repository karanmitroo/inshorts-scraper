The Finance Ministry has set up a high-level committee to promote card payments through incentives like tax rebates and cash back schemes. The move aims to discourage cash transactions. The 11-member committee will review India's payments system, and study the viability of creating a card/digital payments' history so that users can access “instant, low-cost micro-credit”, among other functions.
