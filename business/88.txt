A US court has passed an interim order preventing creditors from collecting debt from fraud-accused Nirav Modi's firm Firestar Diamond Inc after it filed for bankruptcy. "Creditors who violate the stay can be required to pay actual and punitive damages and attorney's fees," the court said. Firestar blamed liquidity and supply chain challenges for bankruptcy after the nearly $2-billion fraud.
