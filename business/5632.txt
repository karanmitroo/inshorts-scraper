US President Donald Trump slipped 220 spots on the Forbes Billionaires list to number 544 with an estimated worth of $3.5 billion (over â‚¹22,000 crore). Trump's fortune fell by about $1 billion over the past year, which is being attributed to a drop in the value of office space in midtown Manhattan, where he owns 10 buildings.
