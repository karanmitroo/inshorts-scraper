Maharashtra's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent a warning notice to fast-food chain McDonald's after an outlet in Mumbai allegedly breached food safety standards. The restaurant, run by Hardcastle Restaurants, was found to be cooking in unhygienic conditions, and also not displaying its licence copy prominently. The FDA gave the outlet 15 days to improve the conditions.
