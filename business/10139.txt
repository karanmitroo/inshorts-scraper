Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJIL) has asked telecom regulator Trai to take action against dominant players, including Airtel, for a "blatant breach of the licence agreement". RJIL has alleged that the dominant operators, under the banner of COAI, had said that its member operators will not provide points of interconnection, which had led to high call failures during RJIL's test trials.
