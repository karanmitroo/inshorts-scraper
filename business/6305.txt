Defending demonetisation, PM Narendra Modi has said, "When can you have an operation? When the body is healthy." Modi said since the economy was in strong condition, timing of demonetisation was "the best". "I am taking such decisions which are hurting big people and because of that I am going to face problems. I am ready for that," he added.
