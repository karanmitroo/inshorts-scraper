An engaged couple flying to their wedding were removed from a United Airlines flight on Saturday by a security officer. The couple claimed another passenger was sleeping across their seats, so they moved to empty "economy plus" seats but their request to pay extra for these was not accepted. Meanwhile, United claimed the couple repeatedly tried occupying more expensive seats.
