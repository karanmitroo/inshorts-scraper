Ride-hailing startup Uber is introducing its own credit card called 'Uber Visa' in the US to give reward points to the users. The Uber Visa has no annual fee and users can earn $100 (₹6,500) after spending $500 (₹32,300) within the first 90 days. Users will be able to redeem the points on rides, UberEats delivery and cash back.
