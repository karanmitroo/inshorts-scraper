Chinese currency Yuan on Saturday joined the International Monetary Fund's basket of reserve currencies. The Yuan joins the US dollar, the euro, the yen, and the British pound in IMF's special drawing rights (SDR) basket, under the move announced in November 2015. This marks the first time a new currency has been added since the euro's launch in 1999.
