The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution on Sunday asked states to remove all local taxes and consider capping the prices of pulses, edible oils and other essential commodities. This would ensure reasonable prices for consumers and better prices for farmers, a statement read. Further, states have been requested to keep hoarding and black-marketing of products in check.
