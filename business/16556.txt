The Indian unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc won a multi-million dollar tax case related to transfer pricing. The Bombay HC felt that the Indian Tax Dept, ardently pursuing claims against foreign firms in India, "clearly exceeded its jurisdiction" in this case. Shell, however, has welcomed the decision, saying that this bodes well for "the country's investment climate".
