Telecom regulator TRAI in a letter to Competition Commission of India asserted that it has powers and expertise to deal with matters relating to competition and predatory pricing in telecom tariffs. TRAI said that some competitive issues fall within the purview of tariffs. This comes after CCI Chairman Devender Sikri earlier asked TRAI to consult CCI on market dominance issues.
