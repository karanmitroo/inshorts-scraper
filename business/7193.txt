In a reason offered for depositing demonetised currency in the bank, ex-AAP member Yogendra Yadav has said he was "assured" by PM Narendra Modi that there was no need to rush to the banks in initial days, following demonetisation. This comes after a new circular was issued stating that people should furnish a reason for depositing old banknotes so late.
