Taxi-hailing service Uber on Wednesday launched a cash payment option for rides in Delhi and Bangalore. Customers will have to choose the cash payment mode before beginning the trip to avail the feature, at the end of which, the driver and the passenger will be notified of the exact fare. The option was first launched in Hyderabad in May.
