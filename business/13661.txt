According to a General Insurance Corporation official, the estimated insurance claims expected after Tamil Nadu floods is around ₹500 crores. While claim estimates might increase as water recedes, majority claims are from owners of automobiles and retail properties of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Insurance firms reportedly lost over ₹4,000 crore in J&K floods and Odisha's Cyclone Hudhud.
