Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel is violating tariff rules by issuing misleading offers and arbitrarily discriminating among its own customers subscribing to the same plan. Jio has demanded highest penalty for Airtel stating two of its plans are being marketed in a misleading manner. It also sought a direction to Airtel to immediately withdraw an offer.
