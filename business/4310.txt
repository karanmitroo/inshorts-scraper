An employee of telco CenturyLink claimed she lost her job after notifying about fraudulent sales practices that charged users for accounts they hadn't requested. CenturyLink allowed persons with personal incentives to add services to customer accounts to falsely indicate approval by customers for these services. This resulted in customers paying millions of dollars for services they didn't want.
