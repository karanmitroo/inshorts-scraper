Price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) Monday saw a steep cut of Rs 113 per cylinder, owing to fall in international oil prices. Further, price of jet fuel (ATF) was reduced by 4.1%. A 14.2-kg non-subsidised cylinder will now be available for Rs 752 in Delhi. This is the fifth reduction in rates of non-subsidised LPG since August this year.
