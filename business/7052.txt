Former Luxembourg PM and President of European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker had blocked EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance by MNCs, according to leaked documents. The leaks revealed that some of EU's smallest members, including Luxembourg, were stopping concerted EU action and protecting their own tax regimes. Notably, EU member states maintain a pledge to not engage in "harmful competition".
