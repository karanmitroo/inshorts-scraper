Online retailer Myntra.com has acquired Native5, a Bengaluru-based start-up, for an undisclosed sum. Native5 builds tools and services to enable cross platform app development on the cloud. It's more of an 'acqui-hire' in which Myntra is acquiring Native5 for its talent, and not so much its product. This is Myntraâ€™s 4th acquisition after acquiring Exclusively.com, SherSingh.com and Fitiquette.
