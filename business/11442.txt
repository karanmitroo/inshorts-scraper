Germany more than doubled its economic growth rate in the quarter ended March, growing at 0.7%, compared to 0.3% in the year-ago period. Higher state and household spending as well as rising investment on construction and capital goods offset a fall in exports, the German Federal Statistical Office said. In comparison, the Eurozone's economy grew 0.6% during the quarter.
