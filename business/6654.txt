Yoshiko Shinohara, who recently retired as chairman of staffing company Temp Holdings, has become Japanâ€™s first self-made woman billionaire. This came after the firm's stock jumped 11.5% in the past month, pushing Shinohara's worth just over $1 billion. With this, 82-year-old Shinohara joins the 26 other self-made female billionaires in Asia, most of whom are from China or Hong Kong.
