Commerce Secretary Rita Teaotia on Thursday said that Indiaâ€™s exports are expected to decrease by nearly 13% to $270 billion in the ongoing fiscal, primarily due to slowdown in global demand and falling crude oil prices. Teaotia further estimated the value of imports during the present financial year at around $390 billion, thereby taking the trade deficit to $120 billion.
