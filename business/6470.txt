The Economic Survey 2016-17 has estimated that the industrial sector will witness a moderate growth of  5.2% in the ongoing fiscal year, as against a 7.4% growth rate in 2015-16. During April-November 2016, a modest growth of 0.4% was observed in the Index of Industrial Production. This was due to moderation in the mining and manufacturing sectors, the survey said.
