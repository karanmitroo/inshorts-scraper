Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power has received in-principle approval from the Bangladesh government for the first phase of a 3,000 MW Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)-based power plant in the country. “This will be the largest foreign direct investment in Bangladesh with a potential investment of over $1.3 billion,” Reliance said. Reportedly, the project is scheduled to be commissioned by 2018-19.
