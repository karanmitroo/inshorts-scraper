The European Union (EU) has fined Volkswagen's truckmaker unit Scania $1.03 billion (â‚¹6,800 crore) on Wednesday over price fixing. It said Scania conspired with 5 truck manufacturers for 14 years to fix prices and pass on costs of new emissions-reducing technology. This fine is EU's second-highest ever for price-fixing after Daimler was fined $1.19 billion in the same investigation.
