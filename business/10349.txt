The government on Friday decided to table the Goods and Services Tax Bill in the Lok Sabha on August 8. The BJP has issued a 'three-line whip' to all MPs to be present. The Rajya Sabha passed the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill on Wednesday and the subsequent central and inter-state GST Bills will now be introduced in the Lower House.
