Following SBI's new rules, including charges on certain transactions, effective April 1, some customers have taken to social media to call for a "no transaction day" on April 6. They are calling for protests from April 24-April 26, if the bank does not remove the charges. Customers of six banks that merged with SBI also have to follow the rules.
