The Cabinet on Monday approved the Consumer Affairs Department's proposal on enhancing the buffer stock for pulses up to 20 lakh tonnes. It will be built through domestic procurement and imports of 10 lakh tonnes each. The specific variety of pulses and their quantities and procurement will be based on their price and availability positions, both domestically and globally.
