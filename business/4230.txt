American Airlines is cutting ties with its current uniform supplier after thousands of employees complained that their new uniforms were causing allergic reactions. The problems with the uniforms began last year, shortly after the airline introduced new uniforms for the first time in nearly 30 years. Airline staff claimed the uniforms were causing rashes, headaches, and respiratory problems.
