Air France CEO Franck Terner has said the airline is in "advanced talks" with Jet Airways for a partnership, as part of efforts to boost its long-haul network. Air France and Jet Airways have been in a codeshare partnership since 2016. Codesharing lets airlines book their passengers on partner carriers and provide travel to destinations where they have no presence.
