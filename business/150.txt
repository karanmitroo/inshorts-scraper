The RBI has refused to extend the February 28 deadline for mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance by prepaid wallet customers. However, the central bank clarified that customers won't lose their outstanding balance even if KYC is not done. Customers can undertake transactions with the available balance but will have to complete the KYC before reloading the wallet.
