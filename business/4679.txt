BT offices in Italy have been raided as part of a probe into the £530 million (over ₹4,400 crore) accounting scandal at the UK telecom giant. Italian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into BT Italia earlier this year alleging "false accounting and embezzlement". Last week, BT said it will axe 4,000 jobs after annual profits plunged by 19%.
