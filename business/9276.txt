Turkish financial markets took a hit after US-based Moody's Investors Service downgraded the country's sovereign credit rating to "junk", from Baa3 to Ba1. The Istanbul 100 stock index was down by 3.8% and the lira also weakened around 1% against the US dollar. This comes after several rating firms downgraded Turkey's credit rating after the failed military coup in July.
