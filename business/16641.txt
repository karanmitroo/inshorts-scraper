Lenovo and Google announced Thursday that Lenovo’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google - a USD 2.91 billion deal - is complete now. Interestingly, Google had bought Motorola Mobility for USD 12.5 billion just two years back, in 2012. Lenovo will operate Motorola as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Motorola’s headquarters will remain in Chicago.
