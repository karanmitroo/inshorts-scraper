The National Stock Exchange on Friday announced it has formed a committee to expedite the process of going public. Under market regulator Sebi’s norms, a stock exchange can get listed but not on its own platform. While BSE has expressed its agreement to launch NSE’s IPO and has approached Sebi for its approval, NSE maintains its intention to get ‘self-listed’.
