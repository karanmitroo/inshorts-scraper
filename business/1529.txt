India's move towards 100% electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 could create a $300 billion domestic battery market, according to a report by NITI Aayog and US' Rocky Mountain Institute. The country will account for two-fifths of global EV battery demand by 2030. NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said, "India's mobility transformation presents an enormous economic opportunity for India."
