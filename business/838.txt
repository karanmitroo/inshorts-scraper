Diesel price touched a record high of ₹61.74 per litre in Delhi on Monday as international oil prices continue to increase. Petrol price rose to ₹71.18 per litre, the highest since August 15, 2014. The BJP-led government had cut the excise duty on fuel only once during its tenure in October 2017, when it was reduced by ₹2 per litre.
