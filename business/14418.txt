IT security solutions company Quick Heal Technologies plans to raise Rs 1,000-1,200 crore through an initial public offer which could value the company at around Rs 4,000 crore. Notably, this would be an Indian software products firm's first listing since nearly one and half decades. The company has also hired three investment banks for the IPO.
