The US Financial Stability Oversight Council on Wednesday voted to remove General Electric’s designation as a “systemically important” financial institution. The tag mandates a company to submit to stricter supervision for ensuring financial stability. GE has sold assets worth almost $200 billion since 2015 and this decision will allow the firm to borrow up to $20 billion for stock buybacks.
