Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio on Thursday asked cellular body COAI to publicly apologise for its "defamatory statements" against Jio. COAI had alleged that telecom regulator TRAI's tariff-related policies were favouring Jio. However, the cellular body later replied saying, "Our differences are with the orders of the regulator (TRAI) and not with any specific operator."
