Emami has said its Chairman RS Agarwal has informed that the â‚¹8-lakh fine imposed on him by SEBI is "without merit" and he will appeal a tribunal. SEBI had fined Agarwal for telling the media he wanted to buy Amrutanjan Healthcare (AHL) without first discussing it with the board. This led to an increased trading of AHL shares in 2010.
