Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway sold off nearly $900 million (₹6,000 crore) worth of Walmart stock last quarter, which was 90% of his stake left in the retailer. Buffett's Walmart holdings, which were worth $3 billion last summer, are now down to less than $100 million. Notably, Buffett’s firm has quadrupled its stake in tech major Apple.
