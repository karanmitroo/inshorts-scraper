PSA Group, the maker of Peugeot cars, has agreed to buy rival Opel from General Motors in a deal valued at $2.3 billion (₹15,300 crore). This would create Europe’s second-largest carmaker to challenge market leader Volkswagen. GM, which owned Opel for almost 90 years, is cutting ties after the division contributed to losses worth $9 billion (₹60,000 crore) since 2009.
