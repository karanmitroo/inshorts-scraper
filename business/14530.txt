State-owned carrier Air India is mulling over introducing a premium economy class, a separate cabin between the economy and business classes. The new class has a different fare and services structure and may take time to be launched as the company evaluates various factors. Tata-SIA-promoted carrier Vistara is currently the only domestic airline to offer the class.
