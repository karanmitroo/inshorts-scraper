A Gujarat jeweller on Friday alleged that he was duped of ₹60 crore by Gitanjali Gems promoter Mehul Choksi and despite notifying Gujarat High Court and government against Choksi in 2015, no action was taken. "Had action been taken then, he wouldn't have escaped today," he said. Mehul Choksi is one of the accused in over ₹11,000 crore PNB scam.
