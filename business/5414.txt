Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law that allows the transfer of cash from Russia to Ukraine only through companies controlled by the Russian Central Bank. This comes after Ukraine forced local banks to ban six Russian payment systems last year. Notably, money transfers from Russia to Ukraine dropped from $1 billion in 2015 to $622 million in 2016.
