US food company Kraft Heinz is not targeting any other large deals for now after being rejected by Unilever, major shareholder and billionaire Warren Buffett said. "There isn't any backup deal. That was the only one that certainly I seriously thought about," he said. "Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz someday? My guess is yes," Buffett added.
