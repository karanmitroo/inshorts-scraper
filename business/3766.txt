Wayne Powell, an ex-employee of Suzuki's US operations, pleaded guilty to filing a false report and violating Clean Air Act over excess emissions in over 23,000 motorcycles. The Justice Department said Powell submitted a report to Environmental Protection Agency in 2014 that said Suzuki's motorcycles did not exceed emissions limits, but later the numbers were found to be falsified.
