Indian Railways' revenue growth has hit a five-year low of 4.6% for the 2015-16 fiscal, compared to around 9-19% growth in the previous four fiscals. Further, the freight volume traffic grew by 0.9% against 4-5% growth since 2010-11. Successive tariff hikes by Railways, slowdown in economic activity and improvement in road infrastructure led to the slowdown, analysts said.
