The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has slammed Patanjali Ayurved for "false and misleading" claims in its advertisements, including those for its hair oil and washing powder brands. The watchdog also ruled that such advertisements "unfairly denigrate" other products in the market. This comes after ASCI's Consumer Complaints Council received 156 complaints against Patanjali in March.
