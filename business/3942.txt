Pakistan's oil and gas regulator on Friday ordered a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell to pay $2.4 million (over â‚¹15 crore) in damages and compensation over a tanker explosion that killed more than 200 people last month. The authority said that the accident was caused due to non-professional driving and the vehicle being lesser than the required specifications.
