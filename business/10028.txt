Insurance in India has moved from being a sellers’ market to become a "digitally driven" buyers’ market, industry chamber Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said on Sunday, citing an EY report. Technology will facilitate the "new wave of change" for Indian insurance, CII added. Insurance bundling on e-commerce portals has enabled greater customisation in product and pricing, it further said.
