Twitter's shares dropped 9.21% to $22.58 on Wednesday after a report suggested that Google would not bid to acquire the micro-blogging site. The report added that Apple isn't likely to put a bid for acquiring Twitter either. Twitter is reportedly looking for potential buyers and wants to conclude buyout negotiations by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on 27 October.
