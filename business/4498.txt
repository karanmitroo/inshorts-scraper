Following reports of mass layoffs at India's biggest IT firms, Infosys Co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan said, "I haven't seen or heard anything about massive layoffs." He further noted employees in the sector are "well paid, very well taken care of, (and) they already have choices (to change jobs)", adding that forming a union in the IT industry is a "bad idea".
