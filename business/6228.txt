US retailers Sears and Kmart have said they will discontinue online sales of 31 products from the Trump Home line, owned by US President Donald Trump. The retailers said the move was to focus their online business on the most profitable items. Notably, this comes amid campaigners calling for boycott of stores doing business with the Trump family.
