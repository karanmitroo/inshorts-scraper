The government Friday scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20% of all gold imported into the country. "It has been decided by the Government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold," the Reserve Bank of India said. The Centre introduced the 80:20 import rule last year to narrow the current account deficit.
