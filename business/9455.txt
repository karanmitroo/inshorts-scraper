EU's largest natural gas producer, Netherlands has used up around 80% of its reserves, according to a government-funded organisation. This comes after a 38% fall in production over the last two years. Notably, Netherlands has also limited extraction of natural gas because of the earthquakes in the Groningen province, which has the EU's largest natural gas deposits.
