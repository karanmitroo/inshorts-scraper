The Donald Trump administration recently unveiled the "largest tax reform" in the history of the United States, which proposes to cut corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%. The plan would have three individual income tax brackets (10%, 25%, and 35%), instead of the current seven. It also proposes to abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in place since 1969.
