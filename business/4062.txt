A leader of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim organisation, Anwar Abbas, has called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain's support for the LGBT community is "not in line" with the nation's ideology. "If Starbucks only does business, then fine. But don't bring ideology here," Abbas said. Notably, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia except in the Aceh province.
