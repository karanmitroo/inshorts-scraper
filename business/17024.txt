To enhance convenience for passengers, SpiceJet has announced introduction of 'SpiceMax', a scheme that offers more leg room for little more money from Aug-15. Customers opting for 'SpiceMax' seats, will enjoy at least 6 inches more legroom compared to standard seats. For a limited time, this can be purchased at a promotional offer of Rs. 500/seat over the ticket price.
