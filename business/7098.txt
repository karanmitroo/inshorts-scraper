Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday denied reports claiming that the government is influencing credit evaluation agency Moody's to improve its sovereign debt ratings. "Any agency makes its ratings on the basis of information made available to them. So, what is wrong if any concerned ministry or department tried to make available any information to them," Naidu said.
