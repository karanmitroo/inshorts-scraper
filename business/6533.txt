Beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya has said, "Government bailed out Air India, but did not bail out Kingfisher Airlines. So much for favours." Mallya said he had begged for help not in terms of loans but policy changes. Admitting he apologised to employees every day, Mallya said he wished the government helped him as his airline failed due to economic situations.
