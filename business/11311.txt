Food regulator FSSAI has decided to remove potassium bromate from the list of permitted food additives. This comes after a study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) claimed that potassium bromate – banned in several countries – is a cancer-causing agent. Notably, nearly 84% of 38 commonly available brands of pre-packaged breads contain potassium bromate, the study added.
