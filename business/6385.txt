PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has said she writes 'personal letters' to her senior executives' parents. "It occurred to me that I had never thanked the parents of my executives for the gift of their child to PepsiCo," she said. Nooyi further said, if employees weren't calling their parents enough, she would tell them why it was important to do so.
