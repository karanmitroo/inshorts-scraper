The Advertising Standards Council of India has pulled up companies like LG, Renault, Lenovo, and Patanjali Ayurved for misleading advertisements in June. The regulator received 159 complaints of misleading ads during the month. These include Renault's claim that its multi-purpose vehicle 'Lodgy' is "number one", which ASCI said was misleading as it was not substantiated with market sales data.
