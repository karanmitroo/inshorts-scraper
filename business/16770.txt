The Supreme Court declined an urgent hearing plea to Sahara chief Subrata Roy on Friday, saying the matter can be taken up later in a regular court. Roy was seeking bail to attend the cremation and perform rituals relating to the death of his aunt. Sources said that Roy had sought relief for 15 days.
