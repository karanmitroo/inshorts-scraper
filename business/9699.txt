The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has introduced a new risk-based model for supervising the market, based on the market regulator Sebi's directions. BSE has asked its trading members to submit digital signatures of their designated officers by September 15 for the digital supervision system. Earlier, Sebi also set deadlines for submission of data and penalties for delays or non-submission.
