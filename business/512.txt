Criticising the Union Budget 2018, former Finance Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian is a "good doctor", but the NDA government is a "bad patient". He said the difference between the Economic Survey, prepared by Subramanian, and the Union Budget was a result of the uneasy relationship between the 'doctor' and 'patient'.
