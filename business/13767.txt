World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan on Thursday said that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal between 12 countries could hamper availability of cheap medicines by protecting powerful patent holders against cheaper generic alternatives. "If these agreements open trade yet close the door to affordable medicines we have to ask the question: is this really progress at all," Chan said.
