A female passenger, whose pet died while being transported by China Eastern Airlines, has been offered £11 (₹908) per kg as compensation. The compensation to the owner was based on the policy the airline uses for damaged or lost luggage. Moreover, another pet owner claimed his dog was shot 50 times by air guns while flying with the same airline.
