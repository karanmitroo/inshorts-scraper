The National Payments Corporation of India will launch its electronic toll collection system on a pilot basis later this month. Initially, only toll payments will be part of it and it will be later extended to parking fees, servicing, and fuel charges. The toll plazas will have terminals that will verify vehicles and automatically debit money from a prepaid account.
