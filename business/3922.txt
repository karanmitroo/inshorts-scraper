The Department of Consumer Affairs has advised people to move the consumer courts if a restaurant charges service charge. â€œService charge is illegal...and should be paid voluntarily. The hotels are not authorised to charge service charge," said an official. The government had issued a guideline in April, saying that people should pay service charge only if satisfied by the service.
