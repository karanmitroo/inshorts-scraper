Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday clarified that the rumours about random raids by the revenue department post demonetisation are false. He added that if raids are being conducted, they are done on the basis of intelligence inputs. Adding that the government will not accept illegal transaction by any sector, Jaitley appealed businesses to adopt digital payments and electronic transactions.
