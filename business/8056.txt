After Tata Chemicals' independent directors backed Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman, Tata Sons has called for an extraordinary general meeting to seek Nusli Wadia's removal. Wadia, Chairman of Bombay Dyeing and Britannia Industries, has been an independent director on boards of Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals. Earlier, Tata Sons appointed Ratan Tata as Interim Chairman, replacing Mistry.
