Government-owned telecom operator MTNL has prepared an over ₹4,200-crore transformation plan even as it faces a financial crisis. The operator, with presence only in Mumbai and Delhi, plans to start a new 4G network in the two cities while expanding its 3G base. MTNL, which posted nearly ₹3,000 crore loss in 2016-17, has admitted it has obsolete fixed line technology.
