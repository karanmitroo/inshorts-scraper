Qatar-based RasGas has agreed to waive off a ₹12,000 crore penalty on Petronet LNG, India’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), for lifting less than agreed LNG in a long-term contract. Petronet’s shares surged 3% after its announcement of entering into a binding sale and purchase agreement, with lowered LNG prices that would help it save ₹4,000 crore annually.
