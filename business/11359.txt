The Delhi High Court on Friday sought responses from the Centre, drug maker Novartis India, and others to a petition seeking a ban on painkiller injection Diclofenac over safety concerns. The petition had challenged an order by the Drug Controller General of India allowing a Mumbai-based firm, which markets Diclofenac Sodium for Novartis in India, to manufacture the injection drug.
