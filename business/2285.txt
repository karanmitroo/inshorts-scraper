Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications (RCom) on Sunday called off its proposed merger with Aircel. "Legal and regulatory uncertainties, and various interventions by vested interests, have caused inordinate delays," the company said. The merger with Aircel and its tower sale to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management was expected to bring down RCom's debt by 60%, which stands at over â‚¹45,000 crore.
