The National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) on Wednesday lowered IT export growth outlook to 8-10% for 2016-17 against the earlier 10-12% projection. “We don’t expect to revisit IT revenue guidance again this year,” President R Chandrasekhar said. Earlier, NASSCOM had said margins of Indian IT companies are under pressure due to reasons like global economic turbulence.
