Former SAP board member Vishal Sikka is all set to be chosen as the new Infosys CEO, sources said. "He has been the choice of KV Kamath and Narayana Murthy for a few months now, much before other candidates were evaluated as part of the CEO hunt. Sikka's stepping down from SAP was a step in this direction," source added.
