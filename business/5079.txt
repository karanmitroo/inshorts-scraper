An American Airlines employee has been accused of hitting a woman, travelling with her twins, with a baby stroller. A fellow passenger, who posted a video of the incident's aftermath, said the employee violently took the woman's stroller, hitting her with it and just missing her baby. He then tried to fight a passenger who stood up for the woman.
