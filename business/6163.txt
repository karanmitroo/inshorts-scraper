US-based entertainment design firm Landmark Entertainment Group's founder has revealed that Apple once briefly considered building a series of cybercafes instead of Apple retail stores in 1996. The 'Apple Cafe' was imagined to bring retail experience together with a boutique coffee shop. The Apple Cafe would have also served as an internet cafe with a “high tech” interior design.
