Kerala government has got the green signal from the RBI to launch a non-banking financial institution- Cheraman Financial Services Limited- based on Islamic finance principles, which will target sectors like infrastructure, services and manufacturing sectors and keep off taboo areas including liquor, tobacco and gambling. The Shariah-compliant institution will desist from charging interest on loans or give interests on deposits.
