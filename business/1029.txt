Fast food chain KFC slammed rival McDonald's in a tweet parody of US President Donald Trump's recent nuclear button claim. KFC in its tweet targeted Ronald McDonald, the clown character used as mascot by McDonald's. Trump claimed that he has a nuclear button which is "bigger and more powerful" than the one North Korean leader Kim Jong-un claims to have.
