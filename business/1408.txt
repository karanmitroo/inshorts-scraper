Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday tweeted saying that Rahul Gandhi's suggestion of a single GST rate of 18% was a grand stupid idea. He further tweeted saying, "Can a Hawai chappal and a BMW car be taxed at the same rate?” Earlier, Jaitley had said that the GST Council could consider merging tax slabs of 12% and 18%.
