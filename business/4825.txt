Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has announced he intends to press charges against the man who shoved a pie in his face. "[M]y intention is to send a message that this type of behaviour isn't acceptable," Joyce said. Notably, Joyce was giving a speech when the man in a business suit walked onto the stage and smeared pie on his face.
