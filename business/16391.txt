Cash-strapped SpiceJet on Monday sought “urgent relief” from the government to run its daily operations. Civil Aviation minister Mahesh Sharma said the request of SpiceJet would be put up before the Prime Minister’s Office. He added that no assurance was given to them. The beleaguered carrier has already cancelled over 1800 flights in a month due to financial crunch.
