After being hit by two deadly tragedies of MH370 and MH17, Malaysia Airlines flights are now flying empty, as pictures posted on social websites show near-empty planes and deserted terminals. The airline is losing about 1.6 million each day. Following the losses, the airlines have almost doubled the commission amount it offers to travel agents.
