Outgoing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said that his biggest regret was having dropped the ball when it came to the smartphone market by not being able to "redeploy talent to the new device" in the early 2000s. Microsoft has "almost no share" in mobile devices, admitted Ballmer with the market currently being dominated by iOS and Android-based devices.
