The US Supreme Court is set to hear tech major Apple's lawsuit against rival Samsung, the courtâ€™s first examination of design patents in 120 years. The lawsuit alleges Samsung of violating design patents by producing copies of Apple's iPhone. Earlier, a court had ruled Samsung should pay to Apple all profits it earned by infringing on the smartphone's design.
