An Australian court has rejected an environmental group's challenge against the $12.5 billion Carmichael mining project, owned by industrialist Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises in Australia. Environmental groups had raised concerns about carbon pollution, climate change and damage to Australia's Great Barrier Reef as the coal mined from Carmichael will be transported to a port near the reef.
