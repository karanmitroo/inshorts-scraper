Car maker Nissan Thursday unveiled a new prototype, with a special super-hydrophobic paint called Ultra-Ever Dry, that it's billing as "self-cleaning" for cars. "By creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment, it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car's surface," the car maker said.
