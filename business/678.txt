Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak recently revealed that he sold all of his Bitcoin when its price neared $20,000, after getting tired of keeping track of its price. "I don't want to be one of those people who watches...and cares about the number," Wozniak said. Notably, Wozniak had bought bitcoin as an "experiment" when it was priced at $700 per coin.
