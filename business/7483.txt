The RBI today announced it will shortly issue ₹20 and ₹50 banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi Series-2005. The new ₹50 notes won't have inset letters in the number panels and new ₹20 notes will have inset letter 'L', while both notes will have 2016 printed on them. The old ₹20 and ₹50 banknotes will, however, continue to be legal tender.
