The Goods and Services Tax Council has decided to exempt prasadam and human hair at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) from tax. This was after TTD requested the Centre to exempt the ingredients it purchases for making laddu and other prasadams from GST. The trust's accounts department had earlier estimated the annual additional burden at â‚¹70 crore after GST imposition.
