India's third largest private lender Axis Bank has re-appointed Shikha Sharma as Managing Director and CEO for a term of three years starting June 2018. This comes less than a week after Axis Bank rubbished news reports that claimed Sharma may join the Tata Group to lead its financial services vertical. Sharma took charge as Axis Bank's CEO in 2009.
