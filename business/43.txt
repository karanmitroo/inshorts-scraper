Cellular body COAI has argued that mere voicing of its concerns "does not form and cannot form a case of defamation" as alleged by Reliance Jio. The Mukesh Ambani-led telco had demanded a public apology from COAI for stating that telecom regulator TRAI favours Jio in tariff policies. COAI said it was "well within its rights" to voice its views.
