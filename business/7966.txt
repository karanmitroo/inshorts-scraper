World's biggest planemaker Boeing on Tuesday said it would cut 500 jobs over four years and shut two plants as it revamps its defence and space unit. The company also said it would create a new global operations group. Boeing's defence, space and security business accounted for 31.4% of the company's total revenue of $23.9 billion in the latest quarter.
