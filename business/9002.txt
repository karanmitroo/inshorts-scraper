The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration has directed L’Oreal India to recall its entire batch of two fairness products after a second test revealed mercury traces in its products. The first tests, on five L’Oreal products, found mercury in all of them. The product testing came after a study claimed that 44% of India's popular fairness creams have mercury traces.
