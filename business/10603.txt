The Commerce Ministry has launched an e-marketplace for online purchase of goods and services by all government ministries and departments. The move is aimed at making government procurement absolutely transparent, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. The prices of goods and services will be on the portal and the departments can decide 'how many units they want', she added.
