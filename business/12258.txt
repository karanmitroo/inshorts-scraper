The Central Excise Department on Tuesday said that jewellers will be granted registration within two working days after submission of applications for payment of the proposed 1% excise duty on non-silver jewellery. This comes after the Finance Minister ruled out rolling back the proposed tax even as the jewellers' strike opposing the move entered the 14th day on Tuesday.
