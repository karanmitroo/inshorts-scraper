US payment processing company Vantiv has agreed to buy its UK rival Worldpay for £9.3 billion (over ₹77,200 crore). Worldpay, UK's largest payment processing company, has agreed to the takeover after reassuring parliament members that deal is not a cheap sell-off of a British company after the Brexit vote. The combined group will be renamed Worldpay and headquartered in US.
