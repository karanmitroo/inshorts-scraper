The labour Ministry on Friday unveiled a single online common return facility for firms registered under 8 central laws through the Shram Suvidha portal. The step was taken to improve ease of doing business in the country. There are 16 labour laws in the country, out of which 10 require filing of returns, either annually or biannually.
