Over 1,000 families have sought action from the government against an alleged fraud in the sale of flats by entities belonging to real-estate developer Niranjan Hiranandani in a special economic zone. “This fraud was perpetrated deliberately by hiding that flats in SEZ can never be sold," they said. However, a Hiranandani spokesperson denied allegations, stating flats were given on “lease”.
