The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday revised its operational guidelines for the camps conducted by Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) and rural branches of banks. The revisions require FLCs to have a minimum seating capacity of 10 for walk-in customers, ensure that financial counsellors are adequately qualified and conduct at least one financial literacy camp every month.
