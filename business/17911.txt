RBI on Thursday relaxed FDI regulations to allow investors to exit their investments subject to the conditions of a minimum lock-in period, and without any assured returns. The relaxation is expected to facilitate great FDI inflows into the country, said RBI. FDI inflows in India from April to October in 2013 dropped 15% from a year earlier to $12.6 billion.
