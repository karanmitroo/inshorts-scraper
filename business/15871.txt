Jaguar Land Rover North America is recalling 61,793 vehicles due to the possibility of the front, passenger-side air bag getting disabled if a lightweight adult sits in the seat.
The recall affects some Range Rovers from the 2013 through 2015 model years and Range Rover Sports from 2014 through 2015. The company said it will start notifying owners in April.
