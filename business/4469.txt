China has rejected US' call to release three activists who were detained while investigating a Chinese company that produced shoes for Ivanka Trump's brand. "Other nations have no right to interfere in our judicial sovereignty," China said. The activists were working undercover to publish a report alleging low pay, excessive overtime, and possible misuse of student labour at the company.
