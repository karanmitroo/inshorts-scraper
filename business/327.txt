Bangalore-based entrepreneur Hari Prasad has claimed that he had written to the Prime Minister's Office in July 2016, alerting them about recent $1.77-billion PNB fraud. Prasad said he wrote to PMO after not receiving any response from ED, CBI, SEBI and Corporate Affairs Ministry. The PMO "acknowledged" the complaint and also sent Registrar of Companies to take action, he added.
