The Union government on Saturday urged the states to exempt pulses from VAT, mandi tax and other local levies for bringing their prices down 5% to 7%. Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that pulse prices are rising because of the increasing demand-supply gap, with the annual output being 17 million tonnes in 2015-16 and consumption being 23 million tonnes.
