Subrata Roy was arrested Friday in Lucknow, after evading for 2-days a non-bailable warrant issued by the SC, for his failure to appear before it in a case of non-refund of 20,000 crore to investors. SC turned down the plea to consider recalling the NBW, saying it is not possible for the special bench assembled on Friday to hear it.
