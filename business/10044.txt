Shares in Mumbai-based Welspun India, one of world's largest textile manufacturers, fell by 20%, their maximum daily limit, on Monday after retail major Target said it was "severing ties" with the company. Target claimed the textile manufacturer's supplies were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton between August 2014 and July 2016. Welspun has launched an inquiry into its supply chain and processes.
