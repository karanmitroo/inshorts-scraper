The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday registered a new case against liquor baron Vijay Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines over the alleged laundering of the money borrowed from a consortium of banks. The agency filed the money laundering case after getting information from the Central Bureau of Investigation, which had also filed a loan default case against him.
