GST Council member Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday said, "Let revenue stabilise and tax buoyancy come, then the Council will look into rationalising or merging tax slabs of 12 and 18%." He said that mostly micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and textiles sector were facing problems as they were exempted from paying taxes under the value-added tax (VAT) regime.
