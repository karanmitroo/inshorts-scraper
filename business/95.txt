After being denied home cooked food in CBI custody, P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram asked the investigating officer to get Swiggy or Zomato. "I hope your investigating officer will have Swiggy or Zomato...I am planning to make full use of it," Karti told CBI. Karti was on Thursday sent to five days in CBI custody in the INX Media case.
