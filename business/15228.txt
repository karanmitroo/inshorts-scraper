The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday agreed to maintain its current oil output to ensure market share amid a global supply glut. The three-year-old quota of 30 million barrels/day has been the most enduring in the group's 55-year history. The group will now meet on December 4, and expects prices to reach $75/barrel by year-end.
