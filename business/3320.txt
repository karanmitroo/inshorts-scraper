Former CEO of General Electric Jeff Immelt, in a farewell letter to employees, said, "The future comes. Never apologise for investing in it." "The long term is about more than a series of short terms. It is about ideas," he added. He further said that one must make really tough decisions and "not fear judgment or criticism".
