South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit has announced that it is shutting down and is filing for bankruptcy after it was hacked for the second time this year. The exchange announced that it had been hacked on Tuesday, causing a loss worth 17% of its total assets.
It was hacked once before in April when reportedly around 4,000 Bitcoins were stolen.
