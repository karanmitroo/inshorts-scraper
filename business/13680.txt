RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that a fall in private and public investment is the "central concern" for the growth of the Indian economy. Factories have been running at 30% below their capacity, Rajan added. RBI has cut its growth forecast for the fiscal year from 7.6% to 7.4%, below the governmentâ€™s target of 8-8.5%.
