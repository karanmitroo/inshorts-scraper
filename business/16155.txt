Information and broadcasting minister Arun Jaitley Sunday opposed the 12-minute-an-hour cap on advertising stipulated for TV news channels by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. "Is the government supposed to tell newspapers and channels as to how much advertisement and how much news. If viewers or readers find it monotonous, they have the power to switch on something else," he added.
