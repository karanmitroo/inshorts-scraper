UK-based oil firm Cairn Energy on Tuesday said that it will seek over $600 million (around ₹4,000 crore) from the Indian government for losses it incurred owing to the ₹10,247 crore tax demand levied by the Income Tax Department in 2014. The company added that it has initiated an arbitration challenging the tax levied under the UK-India Investment agreement.
