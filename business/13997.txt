Oil and gas company Shell reported a net loss of $7.42 billion in the quarter that ended September, its biggest loss in a decade, compared to a $4.46 billion profit last year. The loss was triggered by the falling Brent Crude prices and the $7.89 billion charges that the company took following its withdrawal from Alaskan and Canadian projects.
