Hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand, who specialises in the oil market, has said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to agree on an output freeze this month. This could prompt an increase in oil prices. Andurand put the chance of an agreement at 70% and said a freeze could bump up prices by up to $5 by year-end.
