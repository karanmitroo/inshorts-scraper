The government on Friday extended the minimum import price on 66 steel products for a period of two months as against 173 items earlier, Director General of Foreign Trade Anup Wadhawan said. This comes following the steel industry's demands for the extension of MIP. MIP was imposed in February amid attempts to guard domestic steel producers against cheap in-bound shipments.
