The government on Tuesday said that the use of virtual currencies like Bitcoin is not authorised by the Reserve Bank of India and could result in breach of anti-money laundering laws. The RBI earlier warned that any user and trader dealing with virtual currencies would be doing so at his/her own risk and could face potential financial, and security risks.
