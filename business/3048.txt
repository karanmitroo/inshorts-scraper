UK-based banking major Barclays has installed devices that can track how often bankers are at their desks. The tracking devices are called 'OccupEye', and use heat and motion sensors to record how long employees are spending at their posts. Employees said they donâ€™t remember being informed about the sensors, but the bank's spokespeople said there have been no official complaints.
