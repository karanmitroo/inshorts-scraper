Bharti Airtel announced Wednesday the sale of nearly 20% of its 15,000-strong tower infrastructure in Africa, aimed at paring off the over $10 billion debt that it carries. The company didnâ€™t give out the deal size, but analysts pegged it at less than $1bn. The Sunil Mittal-led company is expected to continue to engage in further sale to cut debt.
