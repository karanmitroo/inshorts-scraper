The sales of Maggi noodles in India have dropped by around 90%, from Rs 350 crore a month earlier to just about Rs 30 crore, according to industry estimates. Maggi noodles had been banned last month by food safety regulator FSSAI over unsafe levels of MSG and lead content. Following the ban, Nestle had withdrawn Maggi noodles from several markets.
