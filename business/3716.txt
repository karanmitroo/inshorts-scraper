The US dollar on Tuesday sank to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies. This came after two Republican senators announced opposition to President Donald Trump's healthcare bill which led to speculation that the bill was likely to be withdrawn. Since hitting a 14-year peak of 103.82 on January 3, the dollar index was down 8.8% at 94.83.
