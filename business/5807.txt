Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma on Friday said, "I go out there (in China) and tell them...if you could talk to Xi Jinping, please talk to him and get us Security Council seat." Sharma said this while discussing how Paytm handles criticism on being backed by China's Alibaba. Business is like a cultural bond between two countries, he added.
