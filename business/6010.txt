Google parent Alphabet's self-driving car developing company Waymo on Friday sued Uber and its self-driving truck company Otto for theft of technology. It claims that Otto head Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee, downloaded over 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files before he quit Waymo. He wiped and reformatted the company laptop to erase forensic fingerprints, Waymo added.
