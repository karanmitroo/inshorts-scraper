The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Finance Bill 2017, along with five amendments which were proposed by the Opposition. The bill will require approval from the Lok Sabha, which can choose to reject the amendments, following which it would still be considered to have been passed by the Parliament. The Bill makes Aadhaar mandatory for filing Income Tax returns.
