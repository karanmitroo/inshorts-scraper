The decision to demonetise high-denomination notes caused the delay in the merger of SBI with its associates by one quarter, Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has said. She further said that the resolution on bad loans was also impacted due to demonetisation. In August 2016, SBI approved its merger with its five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank.
