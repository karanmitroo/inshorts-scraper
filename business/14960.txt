The government on Thursday sanctioned an additional amount of Rs 700 crore to recapitalise weak Regional Rural Banks and extended the validity period for fund infusion to 2016-17, since it had expired. The said banks are unable to maintain the minimum 9% Capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio. The government has a Rs 15 crore budget provision for their recapitalisation.
