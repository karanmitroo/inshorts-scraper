After Co-founder Narayana Murthy raised objections, Infosys on Monday defended the hike in the compensation of its COO UB Pravin Rao. Infosys said it views the statement by Murthy as "important feedback" and will continue to work to ensure long-term interest of the company. Earlier, Murthy said up to 70% salary hike for a top-level person is "not proper".
