The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty on Wednesday hit their 21-month lows before ending 262.08 points down at 23,758.90 and 82.50 points lower at 7,215.70 respectively. Analysts attributed the negative market sentiment to rising concerns over a spike in bad loans of public sector banks, weak Asian cues, overnight losses in US markets and a further drop in oil prices.
