Tech Mahindra Vice Chairman Vineet Nayyar warned that US President Donald Trump's visa policy will damage IT industry. "Trump's America First agenda and focus on curbing the immigration, especially around H-1B visa policies, will hurt the IT sector," he stated. Notably, US is tightening work visa programmes which are widely used by Tech Mahindra and other outsourcing firms.
