Facebook on Thursday disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it may owe the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $3-5 billion in tax liability. The company said it “could have a material adverse impact” on its finances or cash flows. IRS started investigating Facebook in 2013 over transferring understated assets to its base in Ireland.
