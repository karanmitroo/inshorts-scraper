Multinational conglomerate General Electric on Tuesday said it would buy Denmark-based LM Wind Power, a maker of rotor blades used in wind turbines, from private equity firm Doughty Hanson for $1.65 billion. The deal is expected to close by 2017 first half. GE had separated its renewable energy business last year, following the $13.6 billion acquisition of Alstom's power business.
