The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday conducted raids on the premises of Vijay Mallya-run United Breweries Group over a money laundering case against the company. "We are fully cooperating with them," a company spokesperson said. The raid comes after a plea filed by an SBI-led consortium to recover unpaid dues from Mallya was approved.
