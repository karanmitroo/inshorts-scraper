Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said on Sunday that the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in food processing is likely to grow by over 25%. She attributed it to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India's efforts to ease product approvals. Now, the products with approved ingredients will not need approvals, allowing more innovation and product launches, she added.
