Daniel Rivas, a 32-year-old Bank of America tech consultant, sent handwritten 'love letters' to his girlfriend, which had stock tips for her father James Moodhe. Rivas began writing the letters to Moodhe in 2014, which included illegal leaks about unannounced mergers and acquisitions that the latter traded on. Five others, who benefited from Rivasâ€™ leaks, were earlier arrested for insider-trading.
