A Congress leader has submitted a breach of privilege notice against SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya for "insulting farmers and the House" through her farm loan waiver remarks. The leader said he submitted the notice as "Bhattacharya did not apologise for her remarks". Bhattacharya had said that farm loan waivers upset credit discipline as people expect future waivers, which remain unpaid.
