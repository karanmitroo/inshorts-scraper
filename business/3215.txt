Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said 'not even one rupee' of corporate loans has been written off by the government. His statement came after Congress member Deepender Singh Hooda alleged the government has written off loans of corporates but not of farmers. Jaitley also said there has been no scheme of farm loan waiver by the Centre since 2014.
