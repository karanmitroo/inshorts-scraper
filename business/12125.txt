Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that the Centre's policy of directly transferring the subsidy on LPG gas cylinders in consumers' bank accounts has saved the government â‚¹15,000 crore last year. When the policy was launched, around three to four crore consumers could not be traced and plugging this leakage of connections helped us save the money, he added.
