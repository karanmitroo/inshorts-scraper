Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej has said there will be fewer and fewer family businesses in the long term. Globally, entrepreneurship begins with family businesses but these businesses don't last through generations and often collapse by the second or third generation, he stated. Further, Godrej said one shouldn't distinguish by compartmentalising people as being family members or professionals.
