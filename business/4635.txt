A Chinese consortium is buying Ansell's condom division, the world's second largest condom maker, for $600 million (â‚¹3,800 crore). This comes as Ansell bets on surging demand in China as sex becomes a less taboo subject and more emphasis is placed on public health education. Ansell's brands include Jissbon, which is a Chinese translation of James Bond.
