Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, the agency involved in the "Panama Papers" leak, on Thursday said it has lodged complaints against people believed to be â€œinvolved in the theft of information" from the firm. This comes after reports stated that a computer technician at the firm's Geneva, Switzerland office was detained on suspicion of breaching data pertaining to the leak.
