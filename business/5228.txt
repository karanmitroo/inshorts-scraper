The makers of Amul ice-creams told the Bombay high court on Thursday that when a company compares its product to a rival's in an advertisement, some disparagement is "inevitable". This comes after HUL, maker of Kwality Wall's frozen desserts, accused Amul of harming its product through its ongoing ad campaign. "Just saying 'take my product' is not disparagement," Amul noted.
