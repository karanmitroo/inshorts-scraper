In order to take on MNC's like Nike and Adidas, Baba Ramdev's company 'Patanjali' is all set to launch a yoga wear line, after challenging Nestle's Maggi with 'Patanjali Atta Noodles'. "Our yoga wear Vastram will be made of khadi. MNCs have always misled consumers in India", Ramdev said. "We will be a â‚¹5,000-crore company this year", he added.
