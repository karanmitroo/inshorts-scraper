A lawsuit was filed by Gucci and other brands owned by Kering SA against Alibaba Group on Friday alleging it had conspired to manufacture and offer for sale counterfeit products. It was the second time Kering brands had sued Alibaba in a year's time. A spokesperson for Alibaba said the complaint had no basis and they would fight it vigorously.
