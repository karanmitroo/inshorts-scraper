Google announced Wednesday it was selling its Motorola Mobility smartphone unit to Lenovo for about $2.9bn, only two years after the search giant acquired the company. However, Google will keep the vast majority of the 17,000 Motorola Mobility patents. The search giant had bought the smartphone manufacturer in 2011 for $12.5bn, its largest ever deal.
