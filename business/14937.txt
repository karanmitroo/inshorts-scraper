Renmin University of China's report showed that China’s currency Renminbi (RMB) had become the world’s 2nd trade-finance currency after the Dollar. It was also the 5th payment currency and hoped to replace the Japanese Yen to become the 4th most-used international currency. Notably, the IMF had raised the RII (RMB Internationalisation Index) from 0.02 in 2009 to 2.47 in 2014.
