The Chairperson of Biocon Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has said that India is witnessing “jobless” growth. This is due to poor policies that are not creating infrastructure development, manufacturing, and services jobs, she said. Policies that incentivise private sector to invest in mega infrastructure projects, and focus on universal healthcare and education will create a large number of jobs, she added.
