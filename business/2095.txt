The Chief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, today said that the Indian economy is on a "very solid track". She termed GST and demonetisation as "monumental reforms", adding that the slowdown as a result of the reforms is "short-term". This comes after the IMF recently lowered India's growth forecast for 2017 from 7.2% to 6.7%.
