The benchmark Sensex jumped 359 points on Tuesday, rising to an almost three-year high. The Sensex gained in light of the RBI's decision to increase a key policy rate(to 7.75%) to control inflation and at the same time enhance liquidity for banks. Almost half of the Sensex gain was contributed by ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, HDFC and SBI.
