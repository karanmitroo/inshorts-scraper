 The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) has directed the online classified website OLX to withdraw “any offer for sale” of animals or wildlife articles under The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The directive came after the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) complained that the website was allegedly facilitating the sale of wildlife articles protected by law.
