An international tribunal has asked Antrix, ISRO's commercial wing, to pay $672 million in damages to the space technology firm Devas Multimedia for "unlawfully" terminating an agreement in February 2011. Devas agreed a deal to use spectrum from two ISRO satellites for 12 years for $300 million to provide broadband services, which ISRO terminated midway on grounds of national security.
