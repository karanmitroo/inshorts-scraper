Indian Oil plans to give its new refinery in Paradip a $600 million upgrade after the government fast-tracked its plan to bring better quality road vehicle fuels (Euro VI) by 2020. Indian Oil estimates that this refinery can account for 20-30% of its overall profit. The Paradip refinery is reportedly Indian Oil's most advanced refinery to process dirty crude oil.
