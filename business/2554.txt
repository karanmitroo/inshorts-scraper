Rishad Premji, Wipro's Chief Strategy Officer, said that startups can do for India what IT services did in late 1990s. He said the startup ecosystem can be a huge employment creator, huge wealth generator, and a huge brand builder for India. He further said the current discourse on death of India's $154 billion (â‚¹9.87 lakh crore) IT industry is overstated.
