Global coal-fired power generation has fallen by 14%, from 1,090 GW at the beginning of 2016 to 932 GW in July, anti-coal group CoalSwarm reported on Wednesday. The fall was driven by China and India amid oversupply and policy changes, the report added. Notably, the overall 158 GW decline is almost equal to the coal generating capacity of European Union.
