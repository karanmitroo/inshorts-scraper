Commenting on taxing agricultural income, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said states, which have the option to levy the tax, should distinguish between rich and poor farmers. "Why can't we say rich, regardless of where they get their income, should be taxed?" he added. His statement follows a controversy after NITI Aayog member Bibek Debroy suggested agricultural income be taxed.
