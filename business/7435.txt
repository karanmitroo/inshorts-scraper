Before announcing demonetisation move on November 8, PM Narendra Modi said in a cabinet meeting, "I've done all the research and, if it fails, I'm to blame," according to three attending ministers. Reportedly, only Financial Services Secretary Hasmukh Adhia and five others knew about the decision. Announced a month ago, the move scrapped 86% of cash in Asiaâ€™s third-largest economy.
