Mexico has canceled existing sugar export permits to the US to avoid penalties in a dispute over the pace of shipments, according to Reuters. This comes while US President Donald Trump has been seeking to renegotiate the North American Free Trade agreement, claiming that the deal favoured Mexico more. Notably, Mexico is the United States' top foreign supplier of sugar.
