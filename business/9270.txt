Deutsche Bank (DB) on Monday said that it did not need German government's help with a $14 billion settlement with the US, which claims DB mis-sold mortgage-backed securities. This comes after reports suggested that German Chancellor Angela Merkel denied aid to DB Chief Executive John Cryan during a meeting. Notably, DB shares (â‚¬10.62) have hit the lowest since the mid-1980s.
