Jewellery making charges will attract an indirect tax of 5%, lowered from the earlier 18% that was proposed under the GST regime. This will come as a relief to jewellery and gold buyers, who are charged around 10-12% making charges on the cost of gold. Other items on which GST rates have been reduced include cashew nuts, insulin, and agarbatti.
