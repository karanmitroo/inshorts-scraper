US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken was down for more than 48 hours after the site initiated a system upgrade on Thursday morning. Kraken engineers had earlier estimated the downtime would only be of two hours. Users reacted to it, with a user tweeting, "Kraken is the best platform to avoid panic-selling. It just doesn't work when sh*t hits the fan."
