The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued non bailable arrest warrant against Sahara Chief Subrata Roy after he failed to appear before it. The court had on February 20 come down heavily on the Sahara group for not refunding Rs 20,000 crore of investors money despite its order and summoned Roy to be personally present before it today.
