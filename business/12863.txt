The consolidated profit of India's largest telecom provider Bharti Airtel fell 22.2% year-on-year for the quarter ended December to ₹1,117 crore. However, the revenue for the quarter rose 3.7% to ₹24,066 crore as the Airtel customer base reportedly grew by 8.1 million globally to 351 million. The fall in profits was attributed to spectrum payouts and higher interest costs.
