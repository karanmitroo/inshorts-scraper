American internet pioneer AOL's CEO Tim Armstrong, while testifying in a lawsuit brought against the company by investors, revealed that Google, Facebook and Microsoft had refused offers to buy AOL. The company was eventually acquired by Verizon for $4.4 billion in 2015. The lawsuit accuses AOL of cheating investors by undervaluing itself by over $1.5 billion in the Verizon deal.
