The Indian rupee strengthened to as much as 63.82 against the US dollar on Wednesday afternoon, its highest level since August 2015. Gains in the rupee came ahead of expectations that RBI will cut the repo rate by at least 25 basis points today. So far this year, the Indian rupee has gained over 6.2%.
