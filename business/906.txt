JPMorgan Chase & Co has said that its equities trading business booked a $143 million loss linked to a single client in the fourth quarter. The loss was linked to South African retailer Steinhoff, which unveiled accounting issues in early December. The bank said equity markets revenue would have been up 12% without the client loss for the quarter.
