Food company Britannia has launched an initiative that allows consumers to pay for special edition Good Day biscuit packs with their smiles instead of actual currency. Consumers can do so by uploading smiling selfies on their social media pages with the #SmileMoreForAGoodDay. The ‘Pay by Smile’ initiative went live across India through tie-ups with Snapdeal and Hypercity on October 7.
