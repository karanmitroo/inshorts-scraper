Reliance Communications Chairman Anil Ambani has said telecom business is a "guzzler of currency, every minute, every hour and every single day". If the 'mighty Tatas' had to gift it away to Airtel, then very little has to be said about others, he added. Ambani said this after announcing RCom's debt resolution plan which included sale of its wireless assets.
