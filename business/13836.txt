Kalashnikov Concern, makers of AK-47 rifles, are in talks with Indian companies to share technology and make weapons locally. The gunmaker's Chief Executive said partners need to invest $100 million to start production. Russia stopped supplying these assault rifles over the last few years to the country. These rifles are reportedly being used more by non-state actors than national defence.
