Aviation think-tank CAPA has said DGCA's decision of extending notice period for commanding pilots to one year will impact expansion, and increase costs of the carriers. It further said the move will also lead to industrial conflict and tension. Notably, pilots' unions at Jet Airways and Air India have already expressed their opposition to the extension of the notice period.
