Fox News has suspended host Eric Bolling, following allegations that he sent pictures of male genitalia to a number of female colleagues. His lawyer, however, said, "Mr Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications". Hours later, a former regular guest came forward and claimed that Bolling sexually harassed her and called her “Dr McHottie” and “smart, beautiful, and wrong”, on air.
