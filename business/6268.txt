British Airways cabin crew will go on a new strike over a pay dispute from next week, the Unite union announced on Friday. The dispute, over pay involving British Airways' mixed fleet cabin crew, also led to a three-day strike earlier this month. British Airways cancelled 34 flights because of the strike but said all passengers reached their destinations.
