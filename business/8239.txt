NDTV has moved the Supreme Court against the Centreâ€™s order to blackout its Hindi channel for one day on November 9. NDTV stated it had filed a writ petition before the SC challenging the constitutional validity of the government's order. The Editors Guild of India had also condemned the one-day ban.
