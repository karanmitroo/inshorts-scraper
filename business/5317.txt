TRAI has said Reliance Jio was asked to stop its ‘complimentary’ service offer as it wasn't in accordance with the regulatory framework. The regulator had asked Jio to explain how its Summer Surprise offer fits into the regulatory framework but didn't find its response satisfactory. TRAI said Jio will be required to roll back the offer in shortest possible time.
