The HSBC India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.4 in January from 51.1 in December, signalling a robust expansion in business activity. Services sector activity expanded on the back of increase in new business orders amid “solid” demand conditions, an HSBC survey said. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a figure below that level means contraction.
