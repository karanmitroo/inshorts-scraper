Economic think-tank National Council of Applied Economic Research's (NCAER) Business Confidence Index (BCI) registered a sequential increase of 2.2% in the June quarter of the on-going fiscal year. This increase was mainly driven by an improvement in the perception of the economic conditions and the financial position of firms in the next six months, NCAER stated.
