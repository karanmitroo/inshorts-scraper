Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday advised the state governments to stick to fiscal discipline and spend more on infrastructure and development activities. This comes amid reports suggesting the states' share in Union taxes substantially going up after the implementation of the 14th Finance Commission report which prescribed a record 10% increase in their share in Union taxes to 42%.
