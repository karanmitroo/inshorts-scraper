The Supreme Court on Friday asked Sahara India to reveal the source of the â‚¹18,000 crore which it claims to have refunded to investors. The court said it is hard to believe that the "huge" amount was refunded in such a short time. Notably, Sahara Chairman Subrata Roy was arrested in February 2014 for not returning the investors' money.
