Following a gain of nearly 150 points in the early morning trade, the Sensex breached the 28,000 mark for the first time and hit a new all-time-high of 28,006. Persistent inflow of foreign funds, sustained buying by retail investors and a series of economic reforms undertaken by the government lifted the benchmark index to the new high, analysts said.
