The government is considering a plan for the home delivery of petroleum products to consumers if they make a pre-booking, Petroleum Ministry said on Friday. "This would help consumers avoid spending excessive time and long queues at fuel stations," Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. About 3.5 crore people come to fuel stations every day, according to a report.
