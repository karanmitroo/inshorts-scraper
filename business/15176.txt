India’s wholesale prices reportedly fell at a “slower-than-expected” annual rate of 2.36% in May. The decline occurred mainly due to plunging oil and manufacturing goods prices and was in comparison with the 2.5% year-on-year fall that economists had predicted. Wholesale fuel prices in May fell 10.51% year-on-year, while costs of manufacturing goods edged down 0.64% from a year ago.
