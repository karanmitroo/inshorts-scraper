A customer named William Dicks has sued United Airlines claiming that a United reservation agent humiliated him with unsolicited sex talk over his name during a phone call in February. The agent reportedly taunted the man for nearly 48 minutes. The lawsuit also claimed the agent had asked what Dicks would do to him "if they were alone together".
