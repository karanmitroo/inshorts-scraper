Footwear firm Bata has apologised for an ad that showed a man with the caption, "Womaniser and comfortable with it," at a Pakistan mall. It was taken down after it faced social media outrage with users criticising it for being sexist and insensitive towards women. Bata said the ad was printed out of Pakistan and inadvertently displayed at the mall.
