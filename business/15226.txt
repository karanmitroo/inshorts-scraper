Sandwich chain Subway has joined the list of food companies that have stopped using artificial ingredients in their food. The chain that claims to be the fresher alternative to burger outlets will reportedly remove all artificial flavours, colours and preservative from its North American menu by 2017. Food-chains including McDonaldâ€™s, Kraft and Nestle have taken similar steps.
