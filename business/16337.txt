Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd, which sells milk and other dairy products under Amul, is likely to have its turnover increasing by 21% in FY15 at Rs 22,000 crore. The higher turnover is attributed to volume growth. The dairy major aims to increase its milk processing capacity to 320 lakh litre per day from the current level of 230.
