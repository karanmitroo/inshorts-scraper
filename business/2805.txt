Nasdaq has sued rival exchange operator Miami International Holdings, which operates two options exchanges MIAX Options and MIAX Pearl. Nasdaq accused it of copying its core trading technology and stealing trade secrets with former Nasdaq employees' help. While MIAX website says its trading platform was "developed in-house", Nasdaq said MIAX relied on trade secrets acquired by former Nasdaq staff.
