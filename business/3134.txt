Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy on Tuesday termed PM Narendra Modi’s idea of ‘competitive cooperative federalism’ as brilliant. Modi spoke about focussing on competitive cooperative federalism for the growth of states in his Independence Day address. Murthy added that the competitive aspect would make states compete with each other to attract investors and thereby create more jobs.
