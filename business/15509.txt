Budget carrier SpiceJet got a lifeline from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) as it approved the airline's request to allow bookings up to March 26, 2016. "With this schedule we will also increase our daily flights, through which we will provide more same-day return options and better connections for travellers,” SpiceJet’s Chief Operating Officer Sanjiv Kapoor said.
