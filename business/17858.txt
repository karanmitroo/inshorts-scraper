Shares of Chinese technology giant Lenovo slumped more than 8% in Hong Kong on Thursday after it agreed to buy struggling handset maker Motorola from Google for $2.91 billion. Lenovo dived 8.21% to HK$10.06. The deal, which comes a week after Lenovo bought IBM's low-end server business for $2.3 billion, spooked investors who are worried about Motorola's profitability.
