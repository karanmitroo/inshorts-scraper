Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio on Thursday slammed market leader Bharti Airtel for providing only one-way points of interconnection for completing calls rather than both-way points in violation of the licence agreement. After Airtel said it provided 7,007 additional interconnection points, Jio said over 4.6 crore calls between its network and Airtel fail due to inadequate interconnection points.
