Retirement fund body EPFO on Tuesday decided to provide interest on inoperative provident fund accounts from April 1, a move that will benefit over nine crore such account-holders, having total deposits of over â‚¹32,000 crore. The EPFO had stopped payment of interest to such accounts in April 2011 to discourage parking of funds in such dormant accounts.
