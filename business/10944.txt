International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Thursday warned about the risks of 'Brexit', the UK leaving the European Union, saying the economic risks of the exit are on the downside. UK's membership in the EU has brought jobs and income gains to Britain, she added. This comes ahead of the UK's June 23 referendum on EU membership.
