Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's sister Randi Zuckerberg has alleged she was sexually harassed by a male passenger on an Alaska Airlines flight. She said the passenger made "offensive sexual" comments and airline employees didn't take any action as he was a "frequent flier". The crew continued to serve him alcoholic drinks while telling her not to "take it personally".
