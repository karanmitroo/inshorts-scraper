The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) officially launched an economic bloc ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) on Thursday. The ten-member group aims to almost double its $2.6 trillion combined economy by 2030 through freer flow of capital, goods and skilled labour. Notably, the AEC would continue to limit cross-border travel and does not plan to have a common currency.
