In an interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that the market share of Windows phones is not sustainable. Nadella said, "There's no question that in the case of the smartphone, today, we are not that high in share". However, Nadella said that success should not be measured by the device, but by theÂ services being accessed by it.
