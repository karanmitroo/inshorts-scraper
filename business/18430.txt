Travel website Yatra.com seems to have forgotten to renew its domain name, according to media sites. The name had apparently been registered on August-9, 2000, and expired on August-9, 2013. Reportedly the domain registration was later updated, but for a year till August-11, 2014. However, the site was still not functioning at the time of going to press.
