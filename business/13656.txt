Mutual Funds have invested around ₹2.06 lakh crore in the Indian debt markets in the current fiscal (till November 19). With this, net assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry reached an all-time high of ₹13.24 lakh crore. The inflow came after the RBI reduced the policy rate by 50-basis points to 6.75% which increased the bond prices.
