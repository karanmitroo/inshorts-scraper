Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy on Thursday said, "Since we are far, far away from smart cities, I did not talk about it," after he did not mention the smart city project while delivering a lecture on 'City Systems' in Mumbai. Murthy also said that the country is nowhere near the dream of positioning Mumbai as the Asian financial centre.
