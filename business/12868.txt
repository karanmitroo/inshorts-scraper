According to Facebook's latest earnings report, each of its 1.59 billion users is worth $3.73 per financial quarter. However, not all users are worth the same to the social media giant. While users from USA and Canada are worth $13.54 per quarter, Asia-Pacific users are worth only $1.59. Facebook uses its user data to generate revenue by applying targeted advertising.
