David Tovar, the vice president for corporate communications at Wal-Mart, was forced to resign as he lied about receiving an art degree from the University of Delaware. A spokeswoman for the school confirmed in an email that Tovar had attended the university for four years but did not graduate. "It's my mistake. I own it," admitted Tovar in an interview.
