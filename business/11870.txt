World's largest private-sector coal producer Peabody Energy Corporation has filed for bankruptcy in a US court, after a sharp drop in coal prices left it unable to service debt of $10.1 billion, primarily incurred for expansion into Australia. The company reported a loss of $2 billion last year, while its share price has dropped by over 75% this year.
