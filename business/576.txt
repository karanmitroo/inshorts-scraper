In a break from tradition, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has presented the Union Budget 2018 in both Hindi and English. Officials said this was aimed at establishing a greater connection with India's rural population before the upcoming general elections. Barring the use of a few lines in Hindi, Urdu or Tamil, previous Finance Ministers presented the Budget mostly in English.
