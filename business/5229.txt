Chinese oil imports surged to an all-time high last month, overtaking the United States as the world's biggest buyer of crude. March imports stood at 9.17 million barrels per day compared to 8.286 million barrels per day in February. The increase in oil imports is being attributed to purchases by independent domestic refiners, who received new import quotas in January.
