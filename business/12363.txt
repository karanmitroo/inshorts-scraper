The Debt Recovery Tribunal on Monday ruled that UB Group ex-chairman Vijay Mallya cannot access the $75 million settlement he received from UK-based firm Diageo, until the case with SBI is cleared. This was in response to SBI's application against Mallya for defaulting on loans. Earlier in the day, the Enforcement Directorate filed a money laundering case against Mallya.
