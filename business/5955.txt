Japanese automobile parts maker Takata on Monday pleaded guilty to fraud and agreed to pay $1 billion for concealing an airbag defect that caused at least 16 deaths. Takata admitted hiding evidence that its airbag inflators could explode with too much force, hurling lethal shrapnel into passengers. Over 31 million cars have been recalled worldwide over the faulty airbags.
