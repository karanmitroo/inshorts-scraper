Greece's international creditors on Wednesday rejected the government's proposals in a cash-for-reforms deal. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras alleged that creditors were "backing special interests" and accused them of having "no interest in an agreement." Tsipras will now head to Brussels to meet the chiefs of Greece's creditors- European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.
