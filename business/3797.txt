Tata Steel paid bonuses worth £25 million (over ₹210 crore) to its top European managers. The "retention" bonus was reportedly awarded to about 100 top managers at the UK and Dutch offices. The details of the payments made were leaked by a Dutch whistleblower, after which the company admitted to the payment of such bonuses.
