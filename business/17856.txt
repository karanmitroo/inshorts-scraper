A second round of fare war was unleashed by SpiceJet on Friday, with Jet Airways and no-frill carriers IndiGo, GoAir and JetKonnect, (barring Air India), jumping into the race to offer limited period, low-priced air tickets to customers. SpiceJet was the first to launch the fare war, announcing 30% discounted tickets on domestic routes, which was soon followed by IndiGo.
