The SC has said Aircel spectrum will be seized and transferred to some other provider if controller-company Maxis and owner Ananda Krishnan don't appear in court within two weeks. Malaysia-based Maxis was granted 2G spectrum licences in 2006. The case relates to ex-Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran selling majority Aircel shares to Maxis on receiving a â‚¹642 crore bribe from Krishnan.
