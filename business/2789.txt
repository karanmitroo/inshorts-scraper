Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan in his book, 'I Do What I do', said it is a mistake to treat RBI Governor as just another bureaucrat. RBI Governor has to speak up about risks where necessary, he added. "As an apolitical technocrat, he can neither be a cheerleader for the government, nor can he be an unconstrained critic," wrote Rajan.
