Banking major Barclays' CEO Jes Staley will be reprimanded and the bank will cut his pay as regulators begin to investigate how he tried to unmask a whistleblower. The investigation relates to an attempt by Staley to identify the author of a letter involving a senior executive. Trying to identify the complainant could violate US and UK laws protecting whistle-blowers.
