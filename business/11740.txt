RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday suggested that bureaucrats function for a day without their assistants. "Perhaps, then we will have a much better sense of what Aam Aadmi faces and a much greater sympathy for changing the system than we have otherwise," he added. Rajan further said he is mulling introducing such a system within the RBI.
