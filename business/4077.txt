US market regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that it will allow all companies to file paperwork confidentially for initial public offerings (IPOs) starting July 10. The policy is currently restricted to companies with gross revenues of $1 billion or less. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said that this is aimed at reversing the steep decline in IPOs.
