Maruti Suzuki India said on Friday that it has hiked prices of all its products, barring the newly launched S-Cross, by up to Rs 9,000 due to changes in dealer margins. The hike, which has been in effect since August 11, came within a fortnight of Hyundai increasing its prices by a much bigger margin of up to Rs 30,000.
