Apple on Tuesday announced it was issuing bonds worth an estimated $12 billion, despite a cash reserve of $215 billion. The bond issue, the latest in a series of debt issues, will be used largely to return money to shareholders without repatriating any of the $177 billion Apple holds overseas at a tax rate lower than that in the US.
