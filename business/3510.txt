Reliance Jio has written to TRAI slamming Cellular Operators Association of India’s views on interconnection usage charges. Jio said COAI’s views are completely against the “interests of consumers, anti-competitive, and hinder the adoption of newer technology”. The dispute relates to Jio seeking to scrap these charges, while rivals want them to be more than doubled from 14 paise/minute now.
