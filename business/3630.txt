A BBC undercover investigation has revealed that ice used in beverages in McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC in UK contain faecal bacteria. Investigators tested 10 samples at each of the chains for traces of "faecal coliform", which carries a number of diseases. Earlier, BBC detected traces of the same bacteria in iced drinks at Starbucks, Costa Coffee, and Caffe Nero.
