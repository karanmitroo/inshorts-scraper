The Corporate Affairs Ministry has disqualified another 2 lakh directors for holding posts in defaulting companies that have not filed their financial returns for the last three years or more. This move pushes the total number to over 3 lakh while also cancelling the registration of another 10,000 companies. This comes after the government recently deregistered 2.1 lakh companies.
