US-based Mirach Saturday asked Sahara to tender an apology for tarnishing its image failing which it warned of legal action and demanded $13 million in compensation. The compensation would be in addition to $2.6 million already given by Sahara for meeting due diligence. Mirach also said it can still go ahead with the $2.05 billion syndicate loan arrangement for Sahara.
