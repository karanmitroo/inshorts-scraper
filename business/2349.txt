Yoga guru-turned-businessman Baba Ramdev on Wednesday said his company Patanjali Ayurved will need to borrow ₹5,000 crore to expand production capacity. “Patanjali’s revenue will be more than HUL’s (Hindustan Unilever) in 2018-19,” Ramdev said. He further said that his dream is to see Patanjali emerge as the “largest packaged goods company in the world by 2020-21”.
