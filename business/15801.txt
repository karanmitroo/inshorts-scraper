RBI on Thursday relaxed the norms for home loans for up to Rs 10 lakh by allowing banks to add stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges to the cost of the house. The inclusion of these charges will result in a low loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which will ultimately put less burden on borrowers.
