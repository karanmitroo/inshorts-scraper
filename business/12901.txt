Samsung Electronics on Thursday reported a net profit of 3.22 trillion won ($2.66 billion), for the quarter ended December, a 39.7% drop from the corresponding period a year ago. The quarterly revenue grew 1.1% year-on-year to 53.32 trillion won ($44.12 billion). Samsung attributed the fall in its profits to weakened component prices, a difficult business environment, and slowing IT demand.
