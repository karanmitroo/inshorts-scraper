Procter & Gamble (P&G), the parent company of Gillette shaving products, Pampers diapers, and Tide detergent among others reported a 35% year-on-year increase in profits in the quarter ended December to $3.2 billion. Positive sales growth was driven by improving sales in the US, but the strong US dollar pushed the revenue down 9% to $16.92 billion.
