The Income Tax (I-T) department has decided to ‘name and shame’ all categories of taxpayers having a default of ₹1 crore and above by the end of the ongoing financial year. “The names will be published before July 31 next year,” a senior official said. Earlier, the department had named 67 entities with defaults worth ₹20-30 crore in national dailies.
