Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has said the government is coming out with a new policy under which the existing penalty for illegal parking on roads would be increased from ₹200 to ₹1,000. Further, those who complain about illegal parking will be rewarded with ₹200 each, Gadkari said. He also urged traffic authorities to ensure roads are used only for conveyance.
