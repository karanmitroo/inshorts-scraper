The RBI has refused to make public the list of loan defaulters with public sector banks, citing clauses of economic interests of the state. The case relates to an RTI application, which sought the list of people who defaulted on loans of â‚¹1 crore and above. RBI's decision comes despite a 2015 Supreme Court order to make such information public.
