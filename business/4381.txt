A passenger was barred from flight after an angry outburst left a Ryanair employee in tears. The attendant had stopped the flier from boarding because he didn't have a pre-printed boarding pass and refused to pay the €50 (₹3,600) charge. The man accused the employee of having a bad attitude, claiming he was being targeted because of his skin colour.
