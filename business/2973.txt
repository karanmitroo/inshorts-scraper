Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has said not all promoters share Co-founder Narayana Murthy's concerns or even support his public criticism of Infosys and its board. It also said that Infosys founders haven't always been in sync with each other and Murthy's public criticism of the management may not necessarily represent that of the entire promoter group.
