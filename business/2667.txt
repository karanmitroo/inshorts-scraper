Pilots at tour operator firm Thomas Cook went on strike on Friday in a pay dispute, sparking the first strike by UK-based pilots since 1974. However, Thomas Cook said all its flights will operate despite the strike by some pilots from 3 am-3 pm. Thomas Cook CEO Peter Fankhauser said any pay rise had to be "reasonable and affordable".
