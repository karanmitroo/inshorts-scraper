The rupee plunged by 96 paise to breach the 68-level against the US Dollar in early trade on Friday, hitting a 4-month low of 68.24. This comes amid reports favouring Britain's exit in the nation's referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. Notably, this is the Rupee's biggest intraday fall since August 2015.
