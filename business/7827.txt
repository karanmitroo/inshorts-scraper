With Unitech defaulting on loan repayment, housing finance firm HDFC on Friday said that it has sold the realty firm's outstanding loan of â‚¹869 crore to JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company. HDFC attributed the loan default to the sluggish sale of Unitech's apartments. HDFC said these assets turned into non-performing ones only at the end of October 2016.
