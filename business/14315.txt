According to Australia's Environment Minister, a coal project in Australia, which is being developed by Adani Enterprises, is facing delays due to environmental permits. The project, which is worth $7 billion, was blocked by a court in August. This project is opposed by environment groups and saw two banks- Standard Chartered and Commonwealth Bank of Australia- pull out in August.
