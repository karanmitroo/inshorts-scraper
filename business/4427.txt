The Supreme Court on Friday said that those who have Aadhaar cards must link it with PAN to file Income Tax returns. However, SC stayed the government's order to make Aadhaar card mandatory for PAN holders and said it can't be made mandatory for filing Income Tax returns. The apex court maintained that Aadhaar card is voluntary and not mandatory.
