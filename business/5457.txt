Paris has banned all sexist and discriminatory ads from its billboards. The ban, which was proposed by the Department for Equality between Women and Men and the Fight Against Discrimination, includes any image deemed to defame an ethnicity, nationality, religion, sex or age. "Paris is... preventing... glorification of degrading images for certain categories of citizens," officials said.
