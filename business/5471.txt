The stamping of hand baggage will be stopped at Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Cochin airports from April 1. Before this, all hand baggage had to be rubber-stamped by security personnel after it was put through security scanners at airports. Notably, this plan had been implemented earlier but was stopped due to the lack of required security equipment.
