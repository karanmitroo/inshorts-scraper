Twitter has introduced a new tool called 'offers' to expand its reach into commerce. With this tool, advertisers can now post promotions and discounts in users' Twitter feeds, irrespective of whether the users follow those merchants or not. Customers have to use their credit card information to redeem an offer. For now, the feature only works in the US.
