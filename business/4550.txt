A labour activist working undercover to investigate abuses at a Chinese factory that makes Ivanka Trump-branded shoes has been arrested by police, while two others are missing. The activist was arrested on suspicion of illegal surveillance. The men were working with a US nonprofit organisation to publish a report alleging low pay, excessive overtime, and possible misuse of student labour.
