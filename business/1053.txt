Saudi Arabia and the UAE introduced Value Added Tax (VAT) from Monday for the first time. This comes as the Gulf nations aim to diversify their revenue generation from sources other than oil and cope with low oil prices. The other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council– Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar– have also committed to introducing VAT.
