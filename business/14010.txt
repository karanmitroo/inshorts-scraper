Credit rating agency, Moody's on Wednesday said that prices of iron ore are heading towards third straight fall in 2016. Prices of iron ore may average at $45 a metric tonne from current average of $58, amid rising supplies and China's weakening demand. China, the world's top buyer of iron ore, witnessed 8.7% fall in crude steel demand in September.
