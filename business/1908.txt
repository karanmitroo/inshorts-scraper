Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said that the ease of doing business still remains a "major concern" in India. Citing an example, he said he was stunned to get merger approvals in Ghana in three days. "We can't get to three days. But can we get to 30, maybe 60 days?" Mittal asked urging the government to do more.
