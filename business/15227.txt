The Nifty fell for the fifth consecutive session on Friday, posting its worst weekly loss in 3-1/2 years. The Nifty lost 3.78% over the week, ending at 8114.70 while the benchmark Sensex shed 3.81% over the week to close at 26,768.49. Markets have declined rapidly since the RBI announced on Tuesday that future rate-cuts would depend on the weaker-than-expected monsoon.
