The Greek government on Monday ordered the reopening of banks and repayment of millions to creditors, signalling a return to normalcy after weeks of financial turmoil. However, limits on withdrawal of 420 euros/week will still remain. New reforms dictated by the bailout terms also came in force, with VAT on processed food and public transport jumping to 23% from 13%.
