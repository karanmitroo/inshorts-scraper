Cameron Winklevoss, one of the Winklevoss twins, has said that Bitcoin will one day be worth 40 times its present value, which is currently just over $8,000. The Winklevoss twins are believed to be the world's first Bitcoin billionaires. Cameron's brother Tyler Winklevoss said that those who cannot see Bitcoin's potential are suffering from a "failure of imagination".
