The US Federal Reserve detected over 50 cyber breaches between 2011 and 2015, with several incidents described internally as "espionage", according to Fed records. However, the redacted records didn't mention who hacked the systems or whether they accessed sensitive information or stole money. This comes after hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh central bank's account at the New York Fed.
