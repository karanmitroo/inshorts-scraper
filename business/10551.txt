Oil explorer Cairn India on Thursday posted a 28% slump in its consolidated net profit at ₹360 crore for the quarter ended June from ₹501 crore in the year-ago period. The company's net income decreased 28.2% to ₹1,885.11 crore. Fall in oil prices wiped away gains made from operational efficiencies and cost cutting, analysts said.
