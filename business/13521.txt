The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly probing whether banks colluded to speculate prices in the credit default swaps (CDS) market. A credit-default swap is a financial contract insuring the buyer of a corporate or a sovereign bond from possible losses arising from default by the bond's issuer. This derivative market is currently valued at $6 trillion.
