HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL), partly owned by steel tycoon LN Mittal, plans to shut down its Bathinda refinery in Punjab for about 40 days to raise its capacity, reports claimed. HMEL reportedly seeks to raise the unit's crude processing capacity by a quarter to about 2,25,000 barrels per day. State-owned HPCL and Mittal Energy own 49% stake each in HMEL.
