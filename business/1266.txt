The Centre on Tuesday issued a notification taking back the December 31 deadline for linking bank accounts with the Aadhaar number, but did not specify a new date. However, the rule for new accounts to submit their Aadhaar details within six months of account opening remains. Earlier this month, the Centre extended deadline for Aadhaar-PAN linking to March 31, 2018.
