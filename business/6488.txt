The Budget was presented at 5 PM as a practice inherited from the pre-independence era. This lead to simultaneous presentations of the Budget in India and UK. Others believe that this was done to provide relief to officials who worked all night to prepare the statement. Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha first presented the Budget at 11 AM in 2001.
