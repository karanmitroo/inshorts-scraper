The world’s 10 biggest central banks' assets have risen 10% from the end of the previous year to $21.4 trillion now, the fastest pace since 2011’s European debt crisis. The growth coincided with an increase in stock and bond prices. Notably, around 75% of world’s central bank assets are controlled by policy makers in China, US, Japan, and the Euro-zone.
