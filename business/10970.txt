The benchmark indices on Thursday ended the trade in losses after the BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty fell 200.88 and 65.85 points to settle at 26,525.46 and 8,140.75 respectively. Investors remained hesitant amid weak cues in the global markets triggered by the central banks of Japan and the US holding their interest rates steady, analysts said.
