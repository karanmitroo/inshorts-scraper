Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved is seeking to set up a production unit in Sahibganj, Jharkhand that the government plans to turn into a multi-modal hub. Patanjali is reportedly in talks with the Centre and Jharkhand government to use the Sahibganj multi-modal terminal to export to countries like China. Patanjali has already been exporting to the UK, US, Canada, and Mauritius.
