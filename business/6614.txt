The RBI may extend deadline for reduced Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) charges at petrol pumps to promote digital transactions, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. "It is up to RBI how long they will extend that model of MDR," he said. Earlier, RBI slashed MDR charges on card payments and cut levies on online transactions from January 1-March 31.
