The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) reportedly initiated action against 2 builders for diverting funds worth ₹355 crore. One of the builders was directed not to sell more units in its project and other builder's temporary completion certificate was cancelled. This comes after YEIDA sent notices to 8 builders for diverting ₹840 crore meant for completing housing projects.
