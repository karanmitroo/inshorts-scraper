Fashion retailer Forever 21 was, on Thursday, accused of copying a T-shirt design from creative agency WORD. The company said they first designed the t-shirt to raise donations for NGO Planned Parenthood, with 25% of each sale going to the organisation. "We're not ones to point fingers but this looks mighty familiar...we created this shirt with a purpose," WORD said.
