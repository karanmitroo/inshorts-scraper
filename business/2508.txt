Only two potential bidders have reportedly shown initial interest for Sahara group's Aamby Valley resort town, which has been put up for auction at a reserve price of ₹37,392 crore. The auction process has been initiated even as a Mauritius-based investor has signed a pact with Sahara, offering to invest $1.6 billion (over ₹10,200 crore) in the Aamby Valley project.
