Coal India on Friday said its subsidiary Central Coalfields (CCL) will buy back shares worth ₹1,128 crore. This comes after the PSUs had earlier announced the buyback of shares of its other subsidiaries – Mahanadi Coalfields, Northern Coalfields, Western Coalfields and South Eastern Coalfields. A buyback helps a company repurchase outstanding shares from the market using excess cash reserves.
