With cases of mis-selling by banks becoming more pervasive, RBI plans to introduce the concept of 'treat customers fairly' (TCF) for sale of third-party products. TCF is a consumer protection policy designed to address the problem where banks know something about the product that the customer does not, according to RBI. It ensures that banks act in customer's best interest.
