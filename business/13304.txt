Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said that India's fiscal fundamentals are “extremely sound” and the country's growth prospects are strong, despite a global slowdown, which hurt most emerging markets. He further said that the government will prioritise structural reforms like the GST bill, ease of doing business and rationalising direct taxes in the coming year.
