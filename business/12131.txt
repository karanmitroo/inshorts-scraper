Indian firms have raised ₹58,533 crore through the issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) in 2015-16 till March 14, as against ₹9,713 crore in the entire previous fiscal, according to data from markets regulator Sebi. NCDs are bonds that cannot be converted into company equity or stock. Volatile market conditions have forced many companies to opt for NCDs, analysts said.
