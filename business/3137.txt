Telecom operator Vodafone, in a letter to Department of Telecommunications, has said Reliance Jio's "Effective Zero Price Feature Phone" will further erode the revenues of existing operators. Vodafone also requested a reduction in interest rate applied for deferred spectrum payments, to reduce burden on operators. Notably, booking for the Jio's low-cost phone will start from August 24th.
