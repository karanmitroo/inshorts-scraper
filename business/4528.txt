IT major Infosys today said it seeks to hire 20,000 people this year in India, against layoffs of only 400 people on 'performance grounds', according to reports. The company further termed reports of large-scale job losses as "overstated". The statement comes amid reports of technology majors like Wipro and Cognizant initiating annual performance reviews to remove bottom or non-performers.
