Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday that India's economy was in recovery mode as it grew by 7.5% in the January-March quarter of 2014-15, surpassing China’s growth of 7% in the same quarter. Jaitley also refuted former PM Manmohan Singh’s remark that India's economy is “fragile,” saying an economy growing at the world's fastest pace cannot be fragile.
