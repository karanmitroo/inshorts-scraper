Indian mining Company Adani severed ties with Standard Chartered bank after the federal court revoked the environmental approval granted to Adani's $16 billion coal mine project in Australia. This is the second bank that has parted ways with Adani after Australia's Commonwealth Bank, following the revocation of approval a week ago. The coal mine project is opposed by residents.
