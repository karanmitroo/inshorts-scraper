Worldâ€™s biggest coal miner Coal India reported a 10.4% year-on-year decline in production to 32.4 million metric tons in August, the lowest in three years. Shipments also declined by 9.6% to 36.72 million tons, the least since September 2014. The decline was attributed to heavy rains flooding its mines and local agitations, an official said.
