A share buyback means the repurchase of shares by a company, and is usually proposed when the company's shares are undervalued. Buybacks reduce the supply of shares, thereby facilitating higher price. With the reduction in the number of shares, the earnings per share increase, and because the company spends cash to buy stock, cash assets on its balance sheet reduce.
