Tata Sons' ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry claimed in a letter on Tuesday that Ratan Tata wanted to sell the company’s “crown jewel” Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to IBM. Ratan Tata had even approached JRD Tata but he refused to discuss the deal. "It was also a near death experience for TCS at the hands of Ratan Tata," the letter said.
