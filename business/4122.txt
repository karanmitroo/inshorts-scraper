A US man was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty to operating an illegal Bitcoin exchange suspected of laundering money for hackers and linked to a data breach at JPMorgan Chase. Anthony Murgio was accused of processing millions of dollars from 2013-2015 into Bitcoin through unlicensed exchange Coin.mx. The sentence is half as long as prosecutors sought.
