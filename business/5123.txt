Animal retailer Petco has been cleared of negligence in death of a 10-year-old boy who became sick after handling a pet rat sold by the store. Family members of the 10-year-old said he died in 2013 after contracting ‘rat bite fever’. Following his death, they sued Petco for $20 million, claiming it failed to protect customers from potentially dangerous pets.
