The canteen stores department, the retailing platform for India's defence forces, suspended sale of Patanjali's amla juice after receiving a negative state-laboratory test report about the product, reports said. The product was tested at the Central Food Lab in Kolkata, which found it 'unfit for consumption'. Incidentally, the same lab found lead levels above permissible limit in Maggi noodles.
