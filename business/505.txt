Reliance Communications has sought withdrawal of telecom regulator TRAI's directive asking it to refund the unspent balance of subscribers, according to reports. However, TRAI is of the view that the demand on customer refunds is justified as it pertains to premature closure of services, reports added. RCom had shut its voice call services in December last year.
