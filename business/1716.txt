Public sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) has planned to shut down, merge or relocate about 200-300 of its loss-making branches over the next 12 months. The bank might shut down these branches as a part of its consolidation plan. PNB CEO Sunil Mehta said the bank wants to turn loss-making branches into profit-making units by changing their business strategy.
