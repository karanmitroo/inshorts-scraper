The salary packages of SpiceJet's Bombardier Q-400 fleet commanders have been hiked by 20-25%, bringing them on par with Boeing pilots. The move is aimed at arresting the increased migration of such pilots to the cash-rich gulf airlines offering attractive pay packages, sources said. SpiceJet currently has a fleet of 19 Boeing 737s and 15 Bombardier Q-400s.
