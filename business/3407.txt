Australia's largest lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia has been sued by government for 53,700 alleged breaches of money laundering and terrorism financing laws. The case relates to its cash deposit machines, which allow anonymous deposits to recipient accounts that can then be funnelled offshore. Notably, delays in the case resulted in lost intelligence and evidence, including CCTV footage.
