The government has sought Parliament's approval to issue bonds worth ₹80,000 crore to fund capital infusion into public-sector banks. This forms a part of the ₹2.11-trillion capital infusion plan announced by the government in October last year. The government is expected to issue recapitalisation bonds worth ₹1.35 trillion under the plan.
