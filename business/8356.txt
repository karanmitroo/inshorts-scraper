The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons has reportedly computed the penalty payable by Reliance Industries for exploiting gas from state-run ONGC's Krishna-Godavari block at over $1 billion. Earlier, a panel asked the government to claim compensation for “unjust benefit” RIL received from the block. This came after reports claimed natural gas worth ₹11,000 crore migrated to RIL from ONGC’s fields.
