The world's first-ever ATM was opened on June 27, 1967, and the modern-day dispenser that occupies its slot has been sprayed gold to mark its 50th anniversary. The ATM was opened at a Barclays branch in North London. English actor Reg Varney, who starred in TV comedy "On The Buses", was the first person to withdraw cash from the ATM.
