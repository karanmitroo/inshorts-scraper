The UIDAI has allowed banks to hire private data entry operators and enrolment machines to speed up the opening of Aadhaar enrolment centres at bank premises. UIDAI hopes that banks will offer such services at 10% of the branches "at the earliest", CEO AB Pandey said. So far, only 3,000 branches have opened Aadhaar centres as against the 15,300 target.
