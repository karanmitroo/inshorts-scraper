The RBI today asked banks going in for strategic debt restructuring (SDR) to make sufficient provisions of close to 15% of the loans' value. The decision was taken to tide over possible loss in the value of the equity they acquire in lieu of debt and residual loans. RBI also revised more SDR norms as many stakeholders sought more flexibility.
