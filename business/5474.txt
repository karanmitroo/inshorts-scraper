The Reserve Bank of India has issued a notification announcing that payment systems will remain closed on April 1. This comes after an earlier directive asking banks to remain open on April 1, the first day of the next fiscal. While debit and credit card transactions will not be affected, electronic fund transfers using RTGS and NEFT will remain closed.
