The government has changed an over 50-year-old rule by setting a deadline of six months to complete probes in corruption cases involving government employees. It has amended the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, in order to speed up investigation in such cases. Earlier, there was no such time frame to complete such enquiries.
