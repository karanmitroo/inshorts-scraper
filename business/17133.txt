Following Micromax, Karbonn Mobiles and Spice, Hyderabad-based Celkon Mobiles has become the fourth Indian vendor to sign a pact with Google for the Android One initiative. Also, Delhi-based Intex is hoping to seal a deal soon. "With Android One, we are planning to introduce devices that are 20-30% cheaper than earlier products," Celkon executive director Murali Retineni said.
