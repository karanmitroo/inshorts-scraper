Budweiser plans to brew "the first beer on Mars" and will start space experiments by sending barley, beer's key ingredient, into space next month. SpaceX will deliver the shipment of barley to International Space Station and barley will remain in orbit for a month. Once back on Earth, Budweiser and researchers will study how barley reacts in a microgravity environment.
