Liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Thursday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying banks have no right to seek details of his overseas assets, since he is an NRI. He further sought permission to file information about his assets in a sealed cover on June 26, while expressing his willingness to deposit ₹1,590 crore to “prove his bonafide”.
