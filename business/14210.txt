The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday gave the approval to Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba for acquiring approximately 4.14% stake in Jasper Infotech, the owner of Snapdeal. The CCIâ€™s nod is required for acquiring stakes above a certain limit. Alibaba Group, Taiwan-based Foxconn and other investors reportedly invested $500 million in Snapdeal in August.
