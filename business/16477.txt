The Indian rupee on Monday plunged to 62.25 against dollar, its lowest level since February 20 as the US currency continued to remain firm. The Indian unit, however, recouped some losses to trade at 62.09 to a dollar against Friday's close of 62.03 as of 3.03 p.m. The rupee   has fallen for five straight weeks now.
