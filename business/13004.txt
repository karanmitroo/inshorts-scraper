The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the 29.5% divestment (sale of stake) of Hindustan Zinc by the Centre. “No divestment can happen in a public sector undertaking without the Parliament amending the concerned statute,” said the court. The court is also probing into the alleged irregularities of the 29.5% sale of Hindustan Zinc's stakes to Vedanta group in 2002.
