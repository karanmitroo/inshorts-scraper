Air India is drawing up a proposal to offer voluntary buyouts to 15,000 of its 40,000 employees, according to reports. This would be among the largest such offers in India's state sector, as the carrier slashes costs ahead of a 2018 sale. The government has given in-principle approval for disinvestment of the airline, which is facing a â‚¹52,000 crore debt.
