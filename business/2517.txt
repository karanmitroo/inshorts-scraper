Force India Deputy Team Principal Robert Fernley has said that Vijay Mallya's off-track troubles haven't impacted Force India. He further said Mallya "cannot travel but remains as involved as ever in the functioning of the team". "It is never a one-man show. Everyone in the team has been assigned a job and they are performing it rather well," he added.
