Indiaâ€™s Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) on Wednesday recommended a 10% provisional tax on imports of flat sheets and plates of hot-rolled steel to protect local mills hit by cheaper imports. The DGS recommended the 10% duty for a year and a gradual reduction after that. The taxes will be applied on imported steel costing less than $504 a tonne.
