Taxi-hailing service Uber has decided to park its largest international facility outside the US in Hyderabad, by investing $50 million in the city over the next 5 years. Uber plans to "establish a state-of-the-art facility that will house around 500 employees". The "excellent real estate and high standard of living were key factors that influenced this decision", the company said.
