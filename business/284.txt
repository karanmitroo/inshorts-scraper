Former Gitanjali Gems MD Santosh Srivastava has claimed that fraud accused Mehul Choksi sold his customers overpriced and fake diamonds. He also accused Choksi of manipulating company accounts where the inventory would show less stock than what was being declared. "I raised these with Mehul Choksi but I was told to shut up and do my job," he added.
