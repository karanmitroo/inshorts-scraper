Infosys has reportedly made an over ₹100 crore counterclaim against former CFO Rajiv Bansal over breach of trust and non-fulfilment of obligations. Bansal had moved the court against Infosys for withholding his ₹17.38-crore severance package. Infosys had paid Bansal ₹5 crore and suspended the remaining amount after founder Narayana Murthy objected to the package claiming it was 'hush money'.
