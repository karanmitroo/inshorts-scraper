Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said that the US unleashed the potential of immigrants in a way that the place they left did not. "This country has been blessed by immigrants," Buffett stated. Moreover, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO added, "I always say to people who are anti-immigration, let's put it in retroactively. Everybody leaves."
