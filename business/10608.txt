RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday said that the Unified Payment Interface will be operational by month-end. "I have been assured by NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) in this regard," Rajan said, adding that this will eliminate the need to go to bank branches. Using UPI, customers can access virtual accounts to do transactions generated from a bank app.
