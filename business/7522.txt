Adi Godrej, the Chairman of the Godrej Group, has said that talking about a cashless economy is trying to achieve too much too soon. Claiming that no economy in the world is a cashless economy, Godrej added, "All economies, even advanced economies, which have a lot of transactions online, etc, use quite a lot of cash."
