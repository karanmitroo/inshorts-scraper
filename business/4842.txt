Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in an interview on Monday said, "I'm a feminist. I'm proud to be a feminist. I would scream it from the rooftops." She added, "I'm a feminist because I believe equality on gender is critically important." Sandberg further said that she thinks everyone should be a feminist with the correct definition of that word.
