Skincare brand Nivea has pulled an ad declaring “white is purity” after social media users protested its racist connotations, while others used it to spread messages of white supremacy. Nivea further sent an apology, saying the post was not meant to be offensive. The ad, for a deodorant by the company, was meant to target users in the Middle East.
