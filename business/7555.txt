Tata Sons on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that it has every intention of paying the arbitral award of $1.17 billion in favour of Japanese telecom major NTT Docomo. However, it has been unable to do so due to lack of permission from RBI. Notably, Docomo claimed Tatas failed to find a suitable buyer for its Tata Teleservices stake.
