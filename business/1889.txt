Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that the GST, as implemented, has a "faulty design" and its "complication of compliances" has killed jobs and businesses. "GST has ended up taking away livelihoods of ordinary people besides shutting down businesses," Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said quoting Singh. "Demonetisation was organised loot and legalised plunder," he added.
