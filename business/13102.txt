The Indian rupee slipped to a 28-month low of 67.20 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday. Analysts attributed the fall to strong demand for the dollar from importers and banks amid a lower opening in domestic equity markets. The fall was mirrored by other Asian currencies, led by South Korea's won, which also dropped against the dollar.
