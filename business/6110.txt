Hindustan Unilever has launched three 'ayurvedic' shampoos, as India's largest consumer goods maker looks to counter Baba Ramdev-promoted Patanjali Ayurved. "By launching an ayurvedic range under an existing brand" it will be easier for HUL to "gain customers' trust", analysts said. The ayurvedic market is growing at 10%-12% a year and has potential to grow at 16%-17%, they added.
