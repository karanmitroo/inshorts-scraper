German automaker Volkswagen has asked its Indian dealers to stop the delivery of its premium hatchback Polo to new buyers until further notice. The company said the move was because of “other technical issue” and not because of the emissions scandal. Volkswagen sold 13,827 units of the car in the domestic period between April and August this year.
