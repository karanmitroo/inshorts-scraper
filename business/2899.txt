Indian airlines are likely to see slower growth this year due to fuel price increases and a marginal slowdown in the economy, according to the International Air Transport Association. IATA expects India to displace the UK as the third-largest aviation market by 2026. India's air passenger traffic will grow to 442 million by 2035 from the current 120 million passengers.
