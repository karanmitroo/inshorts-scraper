Former CEO of Infosys Vishal Sikka, who resigned from the post last week, said it was one of the hardest decisions of his life, adding that "it had to be done". Sikka, however, said that his departure would not stall the company's push into AI, automation, computing, and data analytics. Notably, Sikka blamed "personal attacks" for his decision to resign.
