Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out nearly ₹4,600 crore from Indian capital markets between February 1-18, primarily on account of continuous fall in crude oil prices and fears of a global slowdown. This takes the total outflow in 2016 to ₹13,414 crore. Earlier, FPIs withdrew ₹13,381 crore from Indian equities and infused ₹3,274 crore into debt in January.
