GST Council member Sushil Modi has said the government is trying to make the GSTN portal more interactive after receiving complaints of difficulties in filing returns. He said he would like to see the portal with pop-ups and adequate alerts and warnings for users. He suggested an option of taking printouts of the forms before they're uploaded to the portal.
