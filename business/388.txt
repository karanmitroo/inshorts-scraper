Dubai gold trader Regal RA has become the Middle East's first company to receive a cryptocurrency trading license. The license will allow Regal to store cryptocurrencies in a vault located in the headquarters of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre. The vault won't be connected to a network while all physical devices will be insured for the market value of the cryptocurrencies.
