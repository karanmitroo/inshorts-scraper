The Economic Survey, which was tabled on Tuesday, stated that there are 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters in the country. This ranks India 13th amongst 18 of its democratic peers in the G-20 nations. In a series of facts, the survey revealed that annual work-related migration was at 90 lakh people, almost double what the 2011 Census suggests.
