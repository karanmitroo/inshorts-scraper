The US Federal Trade Commission has sued Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile phone chips, for bribing Apple to use its chips by lowering its fees and pushing competition out of the market. The complaint also accuses Qualcomm of refusing to license standard essential patents to rival chipmakers. Qualcomm's shares fell as much as 5.6% following news of the suit.
