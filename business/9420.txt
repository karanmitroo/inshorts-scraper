India has approved a $1.04 billion project for constructing and upgrading 558 km of roads to link it with Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. This is to ease passengers and cargo movement, amid attempts to increase inter-regional trade by 60%. The project will receive 50% funding from Asian Development Bank and is expected to be completed within the next two years.
