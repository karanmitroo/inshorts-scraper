UK regulator Ofcom has found Times Now guilty of not delivering news with impartiality, reports said. According to Ofcom, an episode of The Newshour, which was aired two months after the Uri attack and anchored by ex-Times Now journalist Arnab Goswami, didn't reflect Pakistani government's views. The group has assured Ofcom no personal views will be presented in its programmes.
