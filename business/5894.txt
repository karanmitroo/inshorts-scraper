Taco Bell has edited the TV commercial for its "Naked Chicken Chalupa" after some viewers claimed the first version was "racist," according to reports. The original commercial shows a man trying to toss a Chalupa wrapper into a trash can, but he misses and hits a black woman's baby stroller instead. Taco Bell has apologised for the incident.
