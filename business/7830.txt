Dallas Fed Bank President Robert Kaplan on Friday reiterated that he thinks it is nearly time for the US central bank to raise interest rates. "We're at the point where we're ready to remove some accommodation in the near future," Kaplan said. The next policy meeting to review the rates by US central bank will be held from December 13-14.
