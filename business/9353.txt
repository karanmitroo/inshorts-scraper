American oil and gas corporation ExxonMobil has agreed to pay $12 million to the US state Montana and the US government over an oil spill in 2011, reports said on Wednesday. ExxonMobil's oil pipeline ruptured in July 2011, releasing about 1,500 barrels of crude oil into the Yellowstone river, which damaged about a 138-kilometre stretch of natural resources.
