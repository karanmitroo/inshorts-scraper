Former RBI Governor Bimal Jalan has defended the government on GDP calculation, saying it's difficult to gather data in India. "It is very difficult statistically to go to the remotest area...to see what the gross domestic product is in terms of value added," Jalan said. The government came under criticism after estimating 7% GDP growth for December quarter after demonetisation.
