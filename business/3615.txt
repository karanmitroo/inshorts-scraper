The COAI said Reliance Jio, which cited a six-year-old affidavit by TRAI to support its case for scrapping call termination charges, is trying to distort facts to "mislead" people. In the affidavit, TRAI favoured the Bill-and-Keep model, which Jio is pressing for. However, Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea want charges raised from 14 paise per minute now to over 30 paise.
