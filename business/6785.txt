The RBI refused to share “specific details” about demonetisation, citing danger to the life or physical safety of anyone who disclosed this information, Bloomberg reported. This came in response to a question about the number of demonetised notes at banks on the evening of PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation announcement. It also said the information may threaten India's sovereignty, and security.
