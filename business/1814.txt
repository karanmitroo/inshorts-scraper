The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has said that telecom operator Reliance Communications (RCom) will shut down voice call service from December 1. TRAI has directed RCom to not reject any porting out request of its subscribers and customers can move to other networks by December 31. This comes after RCom called off its merger with Aircel in October.
