The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty on Monday ended their trade in losses after they fell 238.98 and 59.45 points to close at 26,396.77 and 8,110.60 respectively. Investor sentiment remained sluggish amid India's industrial production contracting by 0.8% year-on-year in April, weak cues from Asian markets, and the recent drop in crude oil prices, analysts said.
