Tata Sons Interim Chairman Ratan Tata on Wednesday asked shareholders of group companies for their support in removing Cyrus Mistry as director on their boards. Tata Sons has lost confidence in Mistry and his ability to lead the group, he said. Mistry was offered “an opportunity to step down voluntarily from the chairman position, which he rejected”, Tata told shareholders.
