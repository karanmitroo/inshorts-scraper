Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company plans to send several billions of dollars of cash offshore back to the US by next year. His comments followed the EU's decision that Apple pay a record $14.5 billion tax penalty to Ireland, which he called “maddening”. Apple reportedly holds about $215 billion in cash and other liquid investments offshore.
