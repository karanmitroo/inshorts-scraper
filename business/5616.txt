Axis Bank on Wednesday dismissed the reports of its MD and CEO Shikha Sharma's resignation. "The news is false, speculative and is being circulated with the mala fide intention of misleading the investors and the general public," the bank said. Axis Bank's Q3 profit witnessed a sharp fall over Income Tax Department raids on some of its branches post demonetisation.
