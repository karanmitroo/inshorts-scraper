The Central Board of Excise and Customs has increased monetary limit for arrest and prosecution in cases of tax evasion and unlawful utilisation of input tax credit to ₹1 crore. Earlier, this limit for excise and service tax was ₹25 lakh and ₹10 lakh, respectively. This move aims to prevent misuse of the old provisions against small and medium businesses.
