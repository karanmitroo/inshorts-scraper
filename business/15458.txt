To remove manual interventions, HDFC Bank plans to use a software to approve personal loans in just a few seconds. The new software will scan each of the bank's savings accounts, tracking the cash flow pattern which will be verified against the borrower's credit score. The bank will then disburse loans to its customers online, 24x7 and without any paperwork.
