Yoga guru Baba Ramdev, while making announcements about Patanjali's earnings, said the company's sales will make multinational companies do 'kapalbhati'. Foreign firms are not here to do charity but to earn profits, whereas Patanjali's profits will help serve the country, Ramdev added. He further alleged that people were spreading misinformation that MNCs are here to invest and bring technology.
