State-run natural gas distribution company GAIL has cancelled its tender to hire ships to ferry liquefied natural gas, reports said. Two Japanese consortia had reportedly participated in the bidding process that lasted two years but they could not be finally selected due to indigenisation norms. GAIL would now look to charter ships for three-four year terms, an official said.
