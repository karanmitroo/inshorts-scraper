Air India rapped its international crew after it found they have been filling their tiffin boxes with food from the buffet at hotels where they stayed at. The matter came to light after a London hotel e-mailed the airline with the subject line "A buffet is not a takeaway". The airline has warned of serious disciplinary action against the offenders.
