Indian Railway Finance Corporation is set to issue ₹2,000 crore worth of bonds subscribed by LIC, which is disbursing its first tranche of ₹1.5 lakh crore financial assistance deal (signed in March 2015) over five years. "While the insurer would benefit in terms of credit quality, the funding will help the railways carry out long-term projects", an official said.
