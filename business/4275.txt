After Jeff Bezos-led Amazon announced acquiring supermarket chain Whole Foods in a $13.7 billion all-cash deal, the shares of Whole Foods' rivals dipped and wiped off $21.7 billion from their market valuation. The devaluation was shared by Target, Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Dollar General, SuperValu, and Sprouts. Whole Foods, on the other hand, gained more than $3 billion in market cap.
