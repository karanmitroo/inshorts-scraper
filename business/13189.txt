Chinese Yuan sunk to a five-year low after their Central bank on Wednesday cut the currency's reference rate by 0.22% to 6.5314 per US dollar, the lowest level since April 2011. Some major Chinese banks sold US dollars after the Yuan devaluated on Wednesday. â€œUntil China stops weakening the yuan, global markets will struggle to stabilize," a market analyst said.
