The Union Cabinet on Thursday approved draft rules to set up National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), an independent regulator to oversee auditing and accounting standards. NFRA's jurisdiction will extend to listed and large unlisted public companies. The existing self-regulatory body, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), will continue to govern audits of smaller companies.
