The FDI reforms announced by the government on Monday had nothing to do with RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan's announcement to not seek continuation for a second term, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. "We were working on these (FDI reforms) for couple of months. We have made the announcements after the work has been finished", she added.
