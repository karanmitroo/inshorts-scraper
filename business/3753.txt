British chain Poundland has been forced to delay the launch of its 'Twin Peaks' chocolate bar, after receiving a legal letter from Mondelez, Toblerone's US-based manufacturer. The chocolate bar features two humps rather than the distinctive single peak chunks of the Toblerone bar. Its packaging features the Wrekin hill, rather than the Swiss Matterhorn, which is on a Toblerone.
