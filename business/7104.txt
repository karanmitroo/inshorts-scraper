The Japanese government and business groups are launching a campaign to let workers finish early on the last Friday of every month, so they can go out and enjoy. 'Premium Friday' will aim to curb excessive work hours and spur consumption. Interestingly, Japan coined the word 'karoshi' (death by overwork) and Japanese workers use half of their annual paid leave.
