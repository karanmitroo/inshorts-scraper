India's urbanisation may double to over 60% within two to three decades provided that economic growth remains at 7-9%, NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Arvind Panagariya on Wednesday said. The process of urbanisation may accelerate as it has touched the threshold of 30-35% urban population, he added. The country's urbanisation was reported to stand at 31.16% in the 2011 Census.
