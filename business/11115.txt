UK-based financial services firm HSBC is reportedly planning to restructure its global banking division to cut costs and make the business more "agile". The bank is creating a new group to bring together its investment banking, transaction banking, and lending activities. This is part of HSBC's plans announced in June 2015 to slash nearly 20% jobs to boost profits.
