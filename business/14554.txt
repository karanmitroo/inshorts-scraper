German automaker Mercedes-Benz on Wednesday said it will assemble its entry-level CLA sedan at its factory in Pune. As a result of the local assembly, the price of the car is expected to drop by Rs 1-2 lakh. India is the first market outside Europe where the car is being assembled. The CLA sedan was launched in January.
