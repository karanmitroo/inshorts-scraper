Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has filed a patent for a seating arrangement in aircrafts that resembles bunk-beds where seats of one row are stacked above another. The hand-luggage area would then be replaced with a "mezzanine seating area". It is very important from an economic point of view to make optimum use of the available space, Airbus wrote in the patent.
