Union Telecommunications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday said the government will release a postal stamp commemorating the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Notably, the BSE recently became the fastest stock exchange in the world by clocking a median speed of six micro seconds. BSE is also Asia's oldest stock exchange and the world's 11th largest in terms of market capitalisation.
