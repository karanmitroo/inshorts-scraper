Martin Shkreli, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO, who raised an HIV drug's price by 5,400%, has been permanently banned from Twitter. Earlier in January, Shkreli was suspended from Twitter temporarily for alleged harassment of a journalist. The journalist had posted about unwanted digital advances by Shkreli including a message in which he invited her to US President Donald Trump's inauguration.
