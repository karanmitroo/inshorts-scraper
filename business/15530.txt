RBI Deputy governor, HR Khan, Monday said the central bank was working on improving the interaction between the banking system and e-commerce platforms. The e-commerce industry is valued at $12 billion with a user-base which still prefers the 'cash on delivery' payment method. RBI will now work on relaxing the two-step authentication process for small payments to make e-transactions smoother.
