Union Minister Alphons Kannanthanam said 14 out of 16 loss-making hotels, owned by India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), will be sold off to private parties. "Running money-making businesses like hotels aren't good for a government," he stated. He further said he wished to retain The Ashok in New Delhi under government control and make it a "very good" international hotel.
