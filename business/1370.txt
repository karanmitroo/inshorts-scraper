China's two biggest banks, ICBC and China Construction Bank, have ruled out funding Adani Enterprises' Carmichael coal mining project in Australia. Adani is seeking $1.5 billion in funding by March 2018 for the first stage of its proposed mine project in Queensland. The project has been delayed due to concerns over global warming and potential damage to Great Barrier Reef.
