Car sales declined for the 2nd consecutive year as slowing economy, high interest rates and rising fuel prices put off buyers from new purchases. Only 17.86 lakh units were sold during the fiscal 2013-14, reporting a decline of 5%. Sales had fallen 7% in 2012-13, which was the first fall for the Indian car industry in nearly a decade.
