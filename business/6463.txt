The I-T department said it will question 18 lakh taxpayers whose deposits do not match their tax-paying profile, including those who deposited over ₹5 lakh, after demonetisation. It will send e-mails and text messages to them as part of its ‘Operation Clean Money’ project launched on Tuesday. These people will have to reply within 10 days to avoid any notice.
