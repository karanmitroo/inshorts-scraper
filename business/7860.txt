The Finance Ministry on Friday clarified that it is not considering any proposal to seal bank lockers or confiscate jewellery. The ministry's clarification came as a part of a series of 'Myth vs Reality' tweets on demonetisation. It also clarified that the ink on â‚¹2,000 notes will get transferred on to a cloth when it is rubbed against the note.
