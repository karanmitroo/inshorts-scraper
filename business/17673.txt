On Monday, Bank of India became the first state-run lender to allow withdrawal of funds from its ATMs without a debit card. The service allows a customer to send money to a receiver only by using the receiver's mobile number through the bank's ATM or using internet banking facility. The receiver, then, may withdraw money from a designated BoI ATM.
