A video released by Investopedia explains the term ‘dividend’ through an illustrative example. According to the investing education website, “A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or other property.”
