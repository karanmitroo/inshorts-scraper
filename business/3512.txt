FMCG major Hindustan Unilever has said GST hasn't impacted consumer off-take and expects price cuts undertaken by it to drive sales. "With us taking the lead in reducing the consumer price, it should give a fillip to consumer demand," CEO Sanjiv Mehta said. HUL had reduced prices of some products, extending tax benefits it got under GST to consumers.
