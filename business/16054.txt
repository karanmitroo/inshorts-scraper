After another quarter of low sales and earnings, McDonald's decided to replace its President and CEO Donald Thompson on Wednesday. Senior executive vice president Steve Easterbrook has now been chosen to take over as CEO. The popular burger chain saw a 2.4% dip in earnings last year, especially with a slump in sales in China and Japan.
