Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said that it is neither possible nor desirable to make Goa a fully cashless state. The state government aimed to make only up to 50% of the transactions in Goa cashless, the former Goa CM added. In November, Parrikar had said that Goa would be the country's first cashless society.
