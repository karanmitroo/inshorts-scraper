India's largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical has reported its first quarterly loss in at least 12 years, at â‚¹425 crore. The loss came amid settling an antitrust case in US, and a weakening generic drugs market. Stating that the company's first-quarter performance "was not good", billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi said, "The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute."
