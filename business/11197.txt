The Centre on Wednesday issued a notification to constitute the National Company Law Tribunal and its appellate body, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The move is aimed at expediting settlement of corporate disputes and improving ease of doing business in India. The tribunals, formed under the amended Companies Act, will also help in implementing provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
