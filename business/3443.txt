The Scottish government has urged for Scotch whisky to be defined in UK law, so that the industry is protected after UK's exit from European Union. In a letter to British officials, the government warned that failing to define Scotch whisky's status could threaten an industry worth $5.3 billion (â‚¹34,000 crore). "[O]ur whisky industry supports around 20,000 jobs," it added.
