Airlines denying boarding to passengers with confirmed tickets due to overbooking must pay a compensation for deficiency of service, aviation regulator DGCA has said. A passenger can seek compensation over and above the slab-wise refund already available, DGCA added. It further said that its rules do not put any cap on the compensation that can be demanded in overbooking cases.
