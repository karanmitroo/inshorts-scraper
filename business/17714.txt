Supreme Court, which Tuesday sent Sahara chief Subrata Roy to judicial custody, accused him of lying to the court at every step for the last 1.5 years. It rejected Roy's proposal to pay Rs 22,500 crore through sale of assets and furnishing bank guarantee, and said the so-called investors, who had been paid back their money by Sahara, donâ€™t exist.
