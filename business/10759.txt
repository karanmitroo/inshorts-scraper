Belarus on Friday wiped four zeroes off its ruble, redenominating its currency for the third time since 1992. The country has issued new banknotes, wherein one 'new Belarusian ruble' would equal 10,000 'old Belarusian rubles'. The decision was announced last year, when Belarus was hit by an economic recession which forced it to devalue its currency.
