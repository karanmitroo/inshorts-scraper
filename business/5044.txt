Jet Airways on Wednesday de-rostered a pilot after cricketer Harbhajan Singh accused him of racist and violent conduct. In a series of tweets, the cricketer said the pilot abused his physically-challenged friend and physically assaulted a female co-passenger. The airline launched a probe into the incident and said, "We take a very serious view of such issues".
