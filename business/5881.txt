National carrier Air India on Friday replaced its Executive Director (Operations) Captain AK Kathpalia from the post for not taking the breath analyser test. As per law, it is mandatory for all pilots to take the pre-flight medical test before taking flight. Last month, aviation regulator DGCA had suspended Kathpaliaâ€™s flying licence for three months for skipping the mandatory test.
