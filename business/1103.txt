The government on Wednesday cut the interest rate on small savings schemes, such as Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate (NSC), by 0.2 percentage points for the January-March quarter. PPF and NSC will now fetch a lower annual rate of 7.6%. Since April 2016, interest rates of all small saving schemes have been recalibrated on a quarterly basis.
