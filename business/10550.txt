Wipro chairman Azim Premji, who turns 70 on Sunday, completed his engineering degree from Stanford University 30 years after dropping out as he was 'tired of being called a college dropout’. The business tycoon had dropped out of the University at the age of 21 years, to takeover the family business after his father's demise in 1966.
