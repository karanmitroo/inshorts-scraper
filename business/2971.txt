Russian flight attendant Yevgeniya Magurina, who is suing airline Aeroflot claimed she was given less prestigious job opportunities as she was in the “old, fat and ugly” group. She claimed she was demoted to a lower-ranking role because of her age and physical appearance. However, Aeroflot said it was “a routine employee vs. employer dispute" aimed at tarnishing its reputation.
