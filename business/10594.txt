The Central Board of Excise and Customs is planning to move to a paperless and integrated customs system by 2017, for fast-tracking consignment clearances. "Importers still need to show physical copies of various documents like analytical certificates," an official said. The move will reportedly bring down the document processing time to below 10 seconds as against over 10 minutes presently.
