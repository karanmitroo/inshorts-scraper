India's steel consumption in April fell to 5.75 million tonnes (MT) from 7.31 MT in March, the lowest since April 2015, government data showed. The Steel Ministry attributed the fall to a decline in production and imports. For the entire fiscal 2015-16, steel consumption rose 4.3% year-on-year to 80.27 MT. Notably, imports accounted for 14% of steel consumption during 2015-16.
