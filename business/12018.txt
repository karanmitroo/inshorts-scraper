The Income Tax department on Sunday operationalised a facility on its website that will allow taxpayers to file appeals before tax officers. The application can be submitted using a digital signature from now on, the department said. Further, a new feature that will allow taxpayers to append the 'statement of facts' in the appeal has been included, it added.
