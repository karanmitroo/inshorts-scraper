Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) withdrew ₹774 crore from the Indian equity markets during May 2-6. In comparison, they invested ₹769 crore in the debt markets during the period, leading to a net outflow of ₹5 crore. The outflow could be attributed to nervousness in the global markets and an instability in oil prices, analysts said.
