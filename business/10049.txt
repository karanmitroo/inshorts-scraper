Food conglomerate Nestle has announced that Maggi with 57% market share has regained the top spot in the Indian noodles market in June 2016. Maggi was banned in June 2015 over alleged high levels of lead and monosodium glutamate (MSG), in the tested samples. Following that, Maggi's market share had hit a low of 10.9% in November last year.
