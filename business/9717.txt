PM Narendra Modi on Monday stated that effective financial governance needs "full commitment" in acting against corrupt, and elimination of "safe havens" for economic offenders. He called on the G20 members to curb "excessive banking secrecy" and strengthen the global financial safety net. A steady global economic and financial system is necessary for inclusive and sustainable growth, he added.
