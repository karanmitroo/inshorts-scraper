The inventor of chocolate chip cookies, restaurant owner Ruth Wakefield, sold the idea to Nestlé for a lifetime supply of chocolate. She created the Toll House Cookies in 1938 using Nestlé chocolate, and when they proved to be a hit, Nestlé reported a rise in its chocolate sales. Wakefield then signed a deal with Nestlé for $1 and free chocolates.
