Over 10 lakh employees of the nationalised, private and foreign banks will strike work on January 20 and 21, demanding a salary increase and to protest against the reduction in staff strength. ATMs may run out of cash because the strike follows a Sunday and many of the contract cash-filling employees are joining the strike, the employees' associations say.
