After a delay of almost four years, Aviation minister Ajit Singh on Monday allowed foreign airlines to fly the world's largest commercial airliner - Airbus A-380 - from India. The routes it will be operated on are India-Dubai, Frankfurt and Singapore by the airlines of those countries. Incidentally, these routes are very important for Indian carriers.
