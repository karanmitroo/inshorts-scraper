BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has written to the Corporate Affairs Ministry seeking intervention to prevent the closure of e-commerce firm AskMe and save 4,000 jobs. He requested the government to buy the majority stake in AskMe, held by its Malaysia-based investor Astro Overseas. He called for urgent resolution of the whole matter as it will become "infructuous​ after August 31”.
