Following Vishal Sikka's abrupt exit as Infosys CEO, Mahindra Group's Anand Mahindra took to Twitter to support the IT giant. "Infy is iconic & will always have people cheering for it," Mahindra tweeted in response to a post by commentator Harsha Bhogle. Notably, Sikka resigned on Friday, citing "unrelenting, baseless, and increasing personal attacks" as the reason for his decision.
