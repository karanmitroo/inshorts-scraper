The Mexican peso plunged to its lowest-ever levels on Wednesday as Republican candidate Donald Trump inched closer towards victory in the US Presidential elections. The peso weakened over 13%, registering its biggest intraday fall in at least 19 years. Trump had said he'll build a wall along the US-Mexico border to stop illegal migration and Mexico would pay for it.
