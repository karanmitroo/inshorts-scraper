The sculptor of Wall Street's Charging Bull has accused New York's officials of violating his legal rights by allowing the Fearless Girl statue to be installed without his permission. The sculptor, Arturo Di Modica, claimed the Fearless Girl statue infringed on his artistic copyright by changing the creative dynamic with its bold presence. However, he has not filed a lawsuit.
