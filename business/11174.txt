Tata Steel has completed the sale of its long products business to Greybull Capital, several months after the Indian conglomerate decided to sell its entire UK business. Greybull, an investment firm, paid a symbolic Â£1 for the business which makes products like railway track and steel used in construction. Tata, however, didn't mention about selling its remaining UK steel assets.
