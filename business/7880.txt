Reliance Home Finance, part of Reliance Capital, plans to raise up to â‚¹3,500 crore through non-convertible debentures, the company said in a filing. "The NCDs will be issued in one or more tranches subject to the shelf limit," it added. NCDs are loan-linked bonds that cannot be converted into stock and usually offer higher interest rates than convertible debentures.
