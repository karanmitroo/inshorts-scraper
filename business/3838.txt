While investigating reports of user data leak, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has filed a police complaint alleging "unlawful access to its systems", a police officer has said. The complaint is Jio's first official acknowledgement of a systems breach that put sensitive details of customers online. The company had earlier denied the claims and said its user data was safe.
