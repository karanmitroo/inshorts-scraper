Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has asked telecom body TRAI to review its decision on allowing telecom operators to charge differential pricing only when data services are provided through their local servers or intranet. COAI has asked TRAI to instead allow the firms to charge internet services irrespective of whether it is being offered within or outside their network.
