Fashion chain H&M's suppliers in Myanmar employed children as young as 14-year-olds for more than 12 hours a day in their clothing factories, a book 'Modeslavar' has claimed. H&M said it has taken action against such factories. However, “When 14– to 18-year-olds are working it is therefore not a case of child labour, according to international labour laws," it added.
