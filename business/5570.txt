Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which sells products under Amul, on Saturday defended its ice-cream commercial, accusing Hindustan Unilever of resorting to a "stunt to pressurise and frighten" it. "But they (HUL) don't know we are backed by 36 lakh poor farmers who want to make consumers aware," it said. Notably, HUL sought removal of Amul's ad claiming it's misleading.
