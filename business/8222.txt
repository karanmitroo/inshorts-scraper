The banking division of Britain's biggest supermarket chain Tesco Bank has halted online transactions after 20,000 customers' accounts had cash stolen from them in a cyber attack. Around 40,000 accounts saw suspicious transactions and money was raided from half of these, the bank said. Further, the bank hopes to refund all customers within 24 hours.
