The telecom department has said it will meet officials from Airtel, Idea, and Vodafone to hear their pleas against TRAI's â‚¹3,050 crore penalty. In 2016, TRAI recommended the government to impose penalty on the telcos for allegedly denying sufficient interconnection points to Reliance Jio. Jio complained that a large number of calls on its network failed as a result.
