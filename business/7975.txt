The Koyelibeda village in Bastar, which has one ICICI Bank branch and an ATM, received fresh stock of currency for the first time on Friday that was finished within two hours, reports said. The branch which caters to 17 panchayats, 55 villages, and over 20,000 people has no money now, they added. This follows demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes.
