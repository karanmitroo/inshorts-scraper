FBI agents last week arrested a former boyfriend of Indian-American billionaire investor Vinod Khosla's daughter Nina, for threatening to publish her naked photos as part of extortion plot. The guy, Douglas Tarlow, was released from custody for a US District Court preliminary hearing. During their relationship, Khosla "voluntarily took nude photos and video,"  and shared with Tarlow, according to reports.
