A Delhi court has directed a man to pay â‚¹1 lakh as damages to US-based Nike for infringing its trademark. Nike had filed the suit alleging the defendant was found selling sportswear, bags and other goods under its trademark. The court observed that the "deceptively similar" representation of the marks tends to cause confusion in the minds of the public.
