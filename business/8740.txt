The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the state-run NTPC's decision to reject Montecarlo’s techno-commercial bid for the development and operation of three coal mines in Odisha. The SC endorsed the Delhi High Court’s September 30 ruling that upheld the decision to reject the private firm’s bid on the grounds that there would be a loss of public revenue.
