Samsung's acting Chairman and South Korea's third-richest man Lee Jae-yong was sentenced to a five-year jail term after being found guilty of corruption. He was accused of making large donations to foundations run by impeached President Park Geun-hye's close friend, in return for political favours. The sentence is the longest given to any leader of the country's large family-owned businesses.
