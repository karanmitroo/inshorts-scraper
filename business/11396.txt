The Goa government on Tuesday reduced VAT on petrol from 22% to 20% to keep its promise of not allowing prices to exceed ₹60 per litre, a state commercial tax officer said. Petrol prices had crossed ₹60 after the hike announced on Monday night. The current BJP government had earlier abolished VAT on petrol in 2012 which was later reversed.
