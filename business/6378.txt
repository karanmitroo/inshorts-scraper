The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which maps the service sector activity, contracted for the third straight month at 48.7 in January. The index had contracted to 46.8 in the month of December. The contraction has been attributed to the slow recovery of firms following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise demonetisation decision.
