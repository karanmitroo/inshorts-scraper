Responding to a report claiming Times Now has caught up with Republic TV, journalist Arnab Goswami alleged that Times is using methods which are manipulating the system. According to Goswami, Times Now has increased viewership by employing a “forced reach” method. He claimed that Times Now is tying up with cable networks to be the “landing page” on the network.
