Shares of Infosys rallied 15% to hit its fresh 3-month high on Friday, its highest level since May 31, as it beat June quarter earnings estimates on the back of new contract wins and foreign exchange gains. Though the net-profit for the June quarter dipped by 1% to Rs. 2,370 crore sequentially, but the decline was lower than estimates.
