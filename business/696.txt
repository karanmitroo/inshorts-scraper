A district consumer forum in Maharashtra has held SBI guilty of deficiency in service for debiting ₹5,000 from a bank account in spite of a failed ATM withdrawal. In addition to a refund of the wrongly debited amount, the bank was also directed to pay ₹3,000 as compensation and ₹2,000 in legal costs to the account holder.
