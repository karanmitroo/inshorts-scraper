A number of corporates, including Tata, Godrej, Adani, and Patanjali, have shown interest in buying Sahara group's 30 properties estimated to be worth about â‚¹7,400 crore. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court directed sale of Sahara group's Aamby Valley. This has been done over the group's alleged failure to deposit money for refunding its investors.
