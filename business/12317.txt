The government has suffered a loss of â‚¹12,488.93 crore between 2006-07 and 2009-10 through various fees from India's top six mobile operators, due to under-reporting of revenue by the companies, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said. Notably, the government and the operators differ over the definition of adjusted gross revenue, a percentage of which is paid as the fees.
