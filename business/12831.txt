Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju has proposed that airlines should transfer most benefits from the latest jet fuel price cut to the passengers. However, the government will not dictate the prices of air ticket, he added. He claimed that the government's new civil aviation policy is in an advanced stage and that it needs to undergo an inter-ministerial consultancy.
