The state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is set to invest $8.843 billion to bring its oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna-Godavari Basin to production by 2018-19. The company has divided the finds into three clusters for better management. "We plan to get first gas by mid-2018 and first oil by mid-2019," a senior company official said.
