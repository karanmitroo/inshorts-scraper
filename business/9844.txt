As a tribute to outgoing RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, the central bank's staff designed a 'rangoli' to bid him farewell. The 'rangoli' included a collection of different types of bank notes along with Rajan’s portrait and a message in Hindi that read “Kabhi alvida na kehna” (Never say goodbye). Rajan's tenure as the RBI Governor ends on September 4.
