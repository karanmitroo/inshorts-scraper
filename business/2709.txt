Markets regulator SEBI on Wednesday revoked the ban it imposed on 307 entities on suspicion of market manipulation and using stock exchanges for tax evasion. The entities had been barred from trading in the securities market in 2014 and 2015. The 307 entities are different from the 331 suspected shell companies which were restricted from trading on August 7.
