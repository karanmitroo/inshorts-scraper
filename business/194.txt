Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi has told the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that he "cannot depose before the agency now as his passport has been temporarily suspended". Nirav and his uncle Mehul Choksi were summoned by the ED for questioning in connection with the $1.77-billion PNB fraud. Reportedly, Nirav has now been asked to appear before the ED on February 26.
