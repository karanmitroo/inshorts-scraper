The Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs on Tuesday recommended the advancing of the Budget Session to January 31. This will reportedly be followed by the presentation of the combined Union and Railway Budget on February 1. Traditionally, the Budget is tabled on the last working day of February. This is the first time there would be no separate Railway Budget.
