Air India on Wednesday seemingly trolled IndiGo over a video showing a fight between a passenger and IndiGo staffers, with tweets including "Unbeatable Service." Users responded with tweets like, "Air India - We don't beat our customers. We get beaten by our MPs," and "The Maharaja... surely is in a fun mode." However, Air India's tweets were deleted later.
