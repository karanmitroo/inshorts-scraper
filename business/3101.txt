Former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta has been trying to restore his reputation after completing a two-year prison term on insider trading charges, according to a New York Times report. Gupta has "struggled to reconnect" with many former associates and clients in US, reports added. He was found guilty in 2012 of passing confidential information to a hedge fund manager.
