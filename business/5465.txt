The Advertising Standards Council has directed Airtel to "modify" or "withdraw" the advertisement, in which it claims to be "officially the fastest network", by April 11, after a complaint from Reliance Jio. Jio had alleged that Airtel's claim was inaccurate, and it also questioned Airtel's methodology. ASCI ruled in favour of Jio, stating that Airtel's advertisement was "misleading".
