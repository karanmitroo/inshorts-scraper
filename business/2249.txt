Nissan factories in Japan routinely forged inspection documents for new vehicles, according to reports. This comes after Nissan on Monday said it is recalling 1.2 million cars in Japan that did not meet domestic rules on final safety inspections. Reportedly, factories issued false documents to make them look like certified staff had conducted the inspections.
