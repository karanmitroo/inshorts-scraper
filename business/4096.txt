IT giant Cognizant has deferred salary hikes and promotions for its employees for three months, according to reports. For employees up to the level of vice president, the new salaries would be effective from October 1. The decision comes amid the ongoing stress in the IT industry and visa limitations by Donald Trump-led government in the US.
