The government on Friday directed dairy cooperative Amul to ensure bank accounts for all milk producers by December 30 due to “non-availability of funds to the cooperative banks for making payments”. Further, the government has also asked other cooperatives to ensure the opening of accounts for all milk producers and farmers by January 30 next year.
