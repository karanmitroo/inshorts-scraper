Indiaâ€™s external debt declined 1.1% to $479.7 billion at the end of June over the previous quarter, primarily on account of a decline in commercial borrowings, an RBI statement said on Friday. The decline in the external debt's magnitude was partly offset by valuation gains resulting from the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Indian rupee and other currencies.
