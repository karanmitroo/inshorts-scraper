WTI Crude oil on Wednesday slumped to its lowest level in nearly six-and-a-half years after U.S. data showed an unexpected rise in crude stockpiles. The U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) said oil inventories had risen by 2.62 million barrels, defying analysts' expectations of an 820,000 barrel stockpile decline and prompting a $1.75 fall in WTI Crude prices to $40.87.
