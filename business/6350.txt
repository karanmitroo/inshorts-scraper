Reliance Jio, hitting out against Airtel's complaint to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), has said it is the latter's tactic to divert attention from its own violations of telecom norms. "This latest salvo by Airtel is a clear ploy to divert attention from its own violation of licensing conditions by having denied adequate POIs to Jio," the company said.
