Sun TV has registered a net profit of â‚¹218.38 crore in the July-September quarter, a surge of 41.37 percent as compared to the same period last year. The increase in profit is reportedly due to higher revenue from advertisements. Notably, the Ministry of Home Affairs had denied security clearance to Sun TV channels a few months ago.
