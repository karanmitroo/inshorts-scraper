India's largest drugmaker Sun Pharma on Wednesday posted a 75.2% year-on-year decline in its net profit to ₹365.39 crore for the December quarter, compared to ₹1,471.8 crore a year ago. This is the company's smallest profit in over two and a half years. The company said the decline was driven by the overall pricing pressure in the US generics market.
