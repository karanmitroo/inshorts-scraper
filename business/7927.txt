India's largest lender State Bank of India has said that write-offs weren't the same as loan waivers. This followed reports saying SBI wrote off over ₹7,000 crore in loans, including those to Vijay Mallya's defunct Kingfisher Airlines. "A write-off is mostly just...an accounting practice. It doesn’t change anything for the borrower and they are not getting any freedom,” SBI added.
