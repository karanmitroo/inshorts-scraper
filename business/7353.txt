China's richest man Wang Jianlin, Chairman of multinational firm Dalian Wanda, on Monday said he is looking for a successor for his business after his son refused to take over. "I have asked my son...he said he does not want to live a life like I do," Wang stated. Itâ€™s better to hand it to professional managers, he added.
