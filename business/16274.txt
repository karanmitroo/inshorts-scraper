India's economy is expected to "gradually recover" with real GDP growth of 5.5% in the  current fiscal and 6.6% in FY16, says a report by Japanese firm Nomura. The recovery is likely to get support from easing inflationary pressures and measures towards economic reforms, it said. Recently, Indiaâ€™s manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a two-year high in December.
