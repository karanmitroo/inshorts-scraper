The International Labour Organisation has said unemployment rate in India is expected to rise to 3.8% this year as economic slowdown and slower business expansion activities cast a shadow on employment generation. Unemployment is showing an increasing trend since 2011 when it was 3.5%. The same rose to 3.6% in 2012 and climbed to 3.7% last year.
