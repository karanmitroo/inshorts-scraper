Telecom regulator TRAI has granted one more month to Reliance Communications' (RCom) 2G customers to port out of the company's network. TRAI asked RCom to keep all the unique porting codes (UPC) valid till January 31. The regulator said it received many complaints from RCom subscribers regarding their inability to port out due to non-receipt of UPC by them.
