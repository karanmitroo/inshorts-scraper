American motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson is planning to cut around 200 jobs in the US as the company is adjusting its production schedule over lower motorcycle shipment forecast for 2016. Most of the job reductions are to take place in the fourth quarter. The company had lowered its 2016 full-year shipment target by 5,000 units in July.
