Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani in a letter to employees, said the corporate culture that comes with a new owner will help Air India compete globally. "The wonderful team of Air Indians, especially the licensed personnel should therefore have nothing to be sceptical about," he added. Notably, an employees' union staged a protest at Delhi Airport on the same day.
