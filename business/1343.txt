The European Commission (EC) while presenting ideas aimed at making the Eurozone more democratic and resilient to economic shocks said that Europe should have its own economy and finance minister. Adding that current economic growth "encourages us to move ahead", EC President Jean-Claude Juncker said, "After years of crisis, it's now time to take Europe's future into our own hands."
