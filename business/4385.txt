Delta Airlines and Bank of America have pulled their sponsorship from a Julius Caesar production over portrayal of the assassinated Roman leader as US President Donald Trump. The production portrays Caesar as a blond-haired man wearing a business suit with an American flag pin. Earlier, media reported the play depicts "Trump being brutally stabbed to death by women and minorities".
