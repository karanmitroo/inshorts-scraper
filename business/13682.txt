Bank of Japan on Thursday kept steady its stimulus program of increasing the monetary base by $648.5 billion yearly through purchases of government bonds and riskier assets.  The country fell into a technical recession in October. The economy "has continued to recover moderately, although exports and production have been affected by slowdown in emerging economies", BOJ said in a statement.
