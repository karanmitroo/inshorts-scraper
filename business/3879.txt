An international court has ordered tobacco giant Philip Morris to pay the Australian government millions of dollars in legal fees after unsuccessfully suing the nation over its plain packaging laws. In 2011, Australia legislated that cigarettes must be sold in unappealing packets with graphic health warnings. However, Philip Morris tried to overturn the laws but lost the case in 2015.
