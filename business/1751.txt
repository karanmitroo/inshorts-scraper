A reconstituted Multi-Agency Group (MAG) would monitor the investigations into the offshore holdings of 714 Indian individuals and entities identified in Paradise Papers, officials said. The group would include officials from Central Board of Direct Taxes, Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate, and RBI. The MAG was originally formed in April 2016 to probe cases in the Panama Papers leak.
