Volkswagen eclipsed Toyota as the world's top-selling carmaker in the March-quarter as the latter grappled with a series of production stoppages. Toyota's worldwide sales declined 2.3% in the January-March period to 2.46 million, while Volkswagen saw a 0.8% increase in car sales to 2.51 million. Meanwhile, Volkswagen set aside $18.31 billion to help meet costs arising from the emissions scandal.
