Proxy advisory firms have come out in support of Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy's stance in making Panaya probe report public. Infosys earlier declined Murthy's request and claimed that the management has been cleared of alleged wrongdoings. Advisory firms have also questioned the company's stock performance and asked the founders for a specific plan to put Infosys back on stability track.
