Beleaguered liquor baron Vijay Mallya will return to Westminster Magistrates' Court in London today as his extradition trial begins. He has been out on a £650,000 bail bond following his arrest over fraud and money laundering charges earlier this year. Mallya, who is wanted in India for defaulting ₹9000-crore worth loans, will be represented by Queen's Counsel Clare Montgomery.
