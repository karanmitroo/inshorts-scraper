The government on Tuesday launched the Aadhaar Pay service that allows people to do away with debit and credit cards and make payments through their fingerprints. Under the service, biometric devices are attached to merchants' smartphones to allow people with Aadhaar-linked bank accounts to make payments via fingerprints. IDFC Bank has become the first bank to launch Aadhaar Pay service.
