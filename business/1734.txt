Days after the Paradise Papers leak, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that every case listed in the documents would be considered on its individual merit. He added that the same procedure that followed in the Panama Papers leak would be undertaken to probe this one. The Paradise Papers, leaked on Sunday, listed offshore holdings of 714 Indian individuals and entities.
