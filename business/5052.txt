In an attempt to raise quick funds, American Airlines introduced a $250,000 pass in 1981, allowing customers to fly free for life. The unlimited 'AAirpass' was purchased by 66 people, and used by one person to fly to London 16 times in one month. Another person reportedly used his pass to ferry people to the United States for a fee.
