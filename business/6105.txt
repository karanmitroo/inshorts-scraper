Baba Ramdev's charitable trust Patanjali Yogpeeth has succeeded in its appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), which accepted its tax exempt status. In its report, ITAT held that Yoga involves providing medical relief and that it also imparts education. Previously, Yoga was not included in charitable purpose, which meant that Patanjali Yogpeeth was liable to pay income tax.
