Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest carmaker, on Monday reported a 60.5% jump in its Q4 net profit (Rs 1,284.2 Cr) even though the revenue increased just 12.3% as compared to Q4 last year. The company attributed this rise of net profit to higher sales, material cost reduction initiatives, favourable foreign exchange and lower sales promotion expenses.
