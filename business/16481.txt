Following a trademark infringement in Europe, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has decided to register 'khadi' as a 'wordmark' to check against further violation. This will not only prevent anyone else from using the 'khadi' trademark but even check against using a prefix or suffix to the brand.
