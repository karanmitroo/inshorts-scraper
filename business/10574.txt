A Tamil Nadu court has ordered a pay hike of up to 30% for garment manufacturing firms' workers in the state. This is reportedly the first increment in the minimum wages of the garment workers in over 12 years. However, garment manufacturers claimed that the new wages would be "practically impossible" to implement owing to the global market conditions.
