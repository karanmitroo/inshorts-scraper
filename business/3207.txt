A Hyderabad-based customer, who ordered urad dal (black gram) from online retailer Big Basket, found a dead rat inside the dal packet, which was packaged under the website's own brand name. She took photos and videos of the packet and shared them on Twitter. Following the incident, the company apologised to the customer, adding that necessary action will be taken.
