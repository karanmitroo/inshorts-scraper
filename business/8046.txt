The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a three-year $12 billion loan program for Egypt, the largest such package to a Middle East nation. The loan will help in boosting Egyptâ€™s foreign currency inflows, which have dwindled since the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, and revive the African nation's economy. Egypt will receive an immediate disbursement of $2.75 billion, IMF said.
