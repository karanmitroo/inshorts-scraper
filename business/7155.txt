Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday clarified that the government has no intention of imposing a tax on long-term capital gains from securities transactions. This comes after PM Narendra Modi's speech in which he said tax collection from capital market is low due to illegal activities. PM's speech has been misinterpreted in some sections of the media, Jaitley added.
