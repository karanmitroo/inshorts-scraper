Telecom major Vodafone has claimed in the Delhi High Court that the two new tariff plans introduced by Reliance Jio last month were in violation of TRAI guidelines. Vodafone sought to amend its petition filed earlier this year against Jio's free trial offer of 4G services. Vodafone said it was also aggrieved by TRAI allowing the alleged violation to continue.
