Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Friday said the government has set up an e-mail address where people can send information about black money. “People can give information about those trying to convert black money into white on this e-mail address,” he said. The e-mail id, blackmoneyinfo@incometax.gov.in, will be monitored by a cell which will take immediate action after receiving information.
