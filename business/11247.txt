According to reports, an inter-ministerial committee has recommended reducing the royalty paid by companies on thermal coal purchases to the coal-bearing states by three percentage points to 11%. This could reportedly bring down the power cost to consumers by up to 5 paise per unit. Royalty rates are revised every three years and the last revision took place in 2012.
