Japanese conglomerate SoftBank on Monday announced plans to increase its stake in American telecom company Sprint to 85%. This comes after Sprint and T-Mobile called off their merger talks claiming they were "unable to find mutually agreeable terms". Earlier, reports suggested that T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom requested control over the combined company but SoftBank decided to not give it up.
