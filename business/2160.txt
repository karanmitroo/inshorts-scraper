A study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology estimates that about 43 kilograms of gold worth about $1.8 million pass through the country's sewers every year. The study also found that 3,000 kilograms of silver is lost in the sludge each year. Notably, about 70% of the world's gold passes through Swiss refineries every year.
