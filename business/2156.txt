Japanese conglomerate SoftBank's CEO Masayoshi Son in a recent interview said that his net worth was increasing $10 billion per week before the dot-com crash in 2000. "For three days I became richer than Bill Gates," he said. Son further said that before he had a chance to tell anyone, SoftBank's stock crashed.
