India is likely to get about 6 lakh new temporary jobs this year, with an expected 20% increment in salaries. This trend is being attributed to the boom in e-commerce, retailing and manufacturing. In the case where almost a million youth join the workforce each month, of whom barely 2% have formal skills, staffing is likely to create more jobs.
