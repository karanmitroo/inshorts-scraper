German engineering firm Bosch concealed Volkswagen's use of "defeat device" software and "actively participated" in the plan to evade US anti-pollution laws, American lawyers have alleged in a filing. Last month, Bosch lawyers had claimed that such allegations were "wild and unfounded". Earlier, Volkswagen had admitted to installing the "defeat devices" and agreed to a $16.5 billion compensation.
