A UK cafe has apologised to a woman who was labelled a 'weird freak' on a receipt earlier. The customer, who asked for a smaller portion of the meal for her child, demanded to see the receipt, which read, "Small egg and tomato omelette for weird freak". "We have made a direct apology to the customer," the cafe said.
