Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej has disapproved the move of Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy to publicly express concern over the pay hike of the company’s COO Pravin Rao. “Of course, there will be a big gap because there are very few people capable of taking top-level things but I think that it should be left to each company,” he said.
