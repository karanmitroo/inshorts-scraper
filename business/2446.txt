Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata group firms, received shareholders' approval on Thursday to become a private limited company. Earlier, former Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry had written to Tata companies that own shares in Tata Sons to vote against the proposal. The approval comes on the day two Mistry family firms were allowed to legally challenge Tata Sons.
