The Delhi HC has issued notices to the government and the RBI after an NGO for the blind complained that the visually-impaired were finding it difficult to use new notes. It also said the visually-impaired were facing 'huge difficulty' due to change in the size of notes. This is of "very grave public interest", the court said.
