'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli celebrated his fraud trial's conclusion by playing the Wu-Tang Clan album he purchased for $2 million (over â‚¹12 crore). Shkreli, who was convicted for three of eight charges, played 10 minutes from it. Only one copy of the album was made and sold to the highest bidder, Shkreli, who cannot release it commercially for 88 years.
