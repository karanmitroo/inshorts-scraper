Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday ruled out cutting taxes on petrol and diesel. While petrol prices have increased by ₹6.08 since July to reach ₹69.12 per litre in Delhi, the highest since August 2014, diesel rates have risen by ₹3.65 to ₹57.01 per litre. "That situation has not come where we should re-look at tax structure," Pradhan said.
