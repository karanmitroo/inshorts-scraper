Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai on Friday said he shares the optimism of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's remarks that Indian economy will grow at 7% despite a lower GDP growth in first quarter. First quarter was impacted by GST destocking, he added. Pai said growth in future would benefit from creation of one single tax, increased competition, and low inflation.
