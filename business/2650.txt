The Income Tax Department has proposed to appoint 7,600 additional Tax Return Preparers (TRPs) to assist small taxpayers in filing Income Tax Returns. The proposal, which takes the total number of TRPs to 13,000, aims to have at least three TRPs in each district of the country. The soon-to-be launched 'Aaykar Mitra' app will help taxpayers find the nearest TRP.
