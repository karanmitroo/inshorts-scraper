Dr Reddy's laboratory on Tuesday received a restraining order from a US court for selling the purple pill â€“ purple-coloured generic version of heartburn pill 'Nexium' which is  manufactured by Astra Zeneca Plc. The move came after the British drugmaker objected the usage of purple colour in Dr Reddy's version of the drug by approaching a US district court.
