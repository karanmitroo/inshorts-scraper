The Maharashtra government has offered 157 acres of land to a private company, Thrust Aircraft, to produce its indigenously designed 20-seater commercial aircraft. Captain Amol Yadav, who has floated the company, had earlier built a six-seater aircraft which gained attention at the ‘Make In India Week’ in February. The firm is also seeking a ₹200 crore investment for the venture.
