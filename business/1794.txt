Richard Branson's cruise line Virgin Voyages has revealed that the first of the company's three ships will be restricted to passengers 18 years and older, calling it "Adult by Design". Branson said the "Adult by Design" concept was decided because the idea was to deliver fun, relaxation and rejuvenation. The ship is scheduled to launch in 2020, the company said.
