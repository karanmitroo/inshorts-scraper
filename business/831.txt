For the first time in over 11 years, US bank Goldman Sachs is worth less than its rival, Morgan Stanley. Goldman's market capitalisation fell to $95.7 billion on Wednesday, while Morgan Stanley stood at $100 billion. Goldman's shares fell after it reported 50% plunge in bond-trading income and posted its first quarterly loss in six years due to tax laws.
