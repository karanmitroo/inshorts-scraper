Idea Cellular on Tuesday bought Videocon Telecommunications’ spectrum in the Uttar Pradesh (West) and Gujarat circles for ₹3,310 crore. The move would help Idea to expand its 4G network. This is the second biggest deal in the telecom sector since Reliance Communications' acquisition of a 10% stake in Sistema, after the government released its new spectrum sharing guidelines in September.
