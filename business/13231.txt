A joint study by trade organisation ASSOCHAM and consulting firm Deloitte has revealed that Bollywood revenues are likely to cross ₹19,300 crore in FY 2017 compared to the estimate of ₹15,500 crore for this fiscal. Increased overseas revenues of films, growth in the multiplex industry and better quality of Bollywood films will fuel the revenue growth, the study said.
