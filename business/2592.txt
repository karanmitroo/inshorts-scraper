UK's financial regulator has said people investing in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) should be prepared to lose all their money, as some of the schemes floated are potentially outright frauds. It called ICOs "very high-risk, speculative investments". ICOs are a form of fundraising where issuers accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in exchange for a proprietary token related to the specific company.
