GAIL reported a 66.19% drop in its net profit to ₹440.51 crore in the quarter ended September against ₹1,302.90 crore posted in the corresponding period last year. The profit decline was due to "lower price realisation of LPG, other liquid hydrocarbons and petrochemicals products, increased interest and depreciation charges after commissioning of petrochemical expansion plant”, the company said.
