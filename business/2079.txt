At least 66 sophisticated Currency Verification and Processing Systems (CVPS) are being used for counting demonetised notes, the RBI has said in reply to an RTI query. The RBI said it has 59 CVPS machines and added that it has been using 7 other machines available with commercial banks. The RBI didn't disclose the CVPS leasing charges citing "commercial confidence".
