The Delhi High Court on Thursday announced that taxi company Ola can run cabs only with CNG in the capital city. India's former Union Minister and senior advocate P Chidambaram, who appeared for ANI Technologies, the company that owns Ola, said that it will phase out all diesel taxis within two weeks. The firm has also tweaked its mobile application.
