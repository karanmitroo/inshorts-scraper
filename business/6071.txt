The government has sent a memorandum to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, making it mandatory for the body to seek approval before publishing photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The move comes after the dispute over the use of PM Modi's photo in KVIC's diary and calendar. The dispute began over Modi replacing Mahatma Gandhi on KVIC calendars.
