State-run power generator NTPC has withdrawn notices sent to Delhi-based BSES power distribution companies (discoms) after an amicable settlement was reached between them. NTPC had earlier said that power supply to the discoms would be regulated if their dues amounting to â‚¹1,300 crore were not cleared. The talks were mediated by government body Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission.
