Ousted Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry had proposed to more than double the dividend Tata Sons would pay to its shareholders by 2020, reports have stated. Mistry had recommended boosting the payout to about ₹800 crore, against ₹323 crore as of March 2016. The dividend proposal reportedly counters accusations that Tata Trusts had no visibility into the company’s future cash flows.
