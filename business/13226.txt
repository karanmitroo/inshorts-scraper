The BSE on Friday launched a web-based portal “for system driven disclosures for depositories, registrars and share transfer agents”. The move follows capital market regulator SEBI’s decision to facilitate system-based disclosures needed under insider trading norms and takeover regulations. Disclosures on disposal and acquisition of shares by promoters and pledging of equity shares would be made.
