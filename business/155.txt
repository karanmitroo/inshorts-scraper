US President Donald Trump has called the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a 'catastrophe', accusing the trade body of making it tough for the US to do business. Trump further cited the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada, and Mexico saying it could not impose higher import tariffs on the two countries due to the WTO rules.
