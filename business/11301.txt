Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Thursday said there is "no reason" why the deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from France should not be concluded in June. He further rejected suggestions of a delay in signing the €7.89 billion (₹59,200 crore) contract, saying any such process takes at least 6-8 months. The deal had been announced in April 2015.
