Mobile payment company MobiKwik on Tuesday announced a partnership with IRCTC to integrate its mobile wallet system for payments through IRCTC's Android app. Payment from MobiKwik wallet would directly be made from within the retailer's platform thus making transaction failure non-existent, Mobikwik CEO said. MobiKwik was founded in 2009 and reportedly claims a user base of 25 million users.
