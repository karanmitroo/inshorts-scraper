The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has set a target of installing one lakh family-size biogas plants in the ongoing financial year. This can save about 21.9 lakh LPG cylinders annually, an official release claimed. The bio-manure, a by-product of the plant, when used can also cut down fertiliser consumption by about 10,000 tonnes of urea equivalent, it added.
