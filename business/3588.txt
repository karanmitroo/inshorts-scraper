Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has written to TRAI Chairman RS Sharma, saying he's "at a loss as to why TRAI should be considering Bill and Keep model". Mittal said IUC is built on fair settlements for work done by operators for carrying each other's calls. Notably, Reliance Jio is pressing for this model wherein IUC will effectively be scrapped.
