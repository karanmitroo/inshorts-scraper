The parliamentary panel on finance has decided to examine the reforms in the budget-making process approved by the Cabinet and their ramifications, a Lok Sabha bulletin claimed. Recently, the Cabinet scrapped the practice of presenting a separate Railway Budget and merged it with the Union Budget. It also removed the distinction between the Budget's plan and non-plan expenditure.
