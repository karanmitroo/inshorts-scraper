CPRL, the north and east India licensee of McDonald's, has partnered with a new logistics firm and has started reopening about 84 closed restaurants. Original logistics partner Radhakrishna Foodland discontinued supply chain services to the company on December 20. This comes amid an ongoing legal battle between CPRL MD Vikram Bakshi and McDonald's over the termination of franchise agreement.
