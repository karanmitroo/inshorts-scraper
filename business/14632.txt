Sanjay Kapoor, Indian smartphone manufacturer Micromaxâ€™s chairman, is stepping down from his position. This is reportedly being done due to his rising differences with promoters over company strategy. A former Bharti Airtel chief executive for India and South Asia, Kapoor joined Micromax in June last year and had been focusing on its base growth in areas like storage and analytics.
