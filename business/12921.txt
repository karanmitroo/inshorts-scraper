Apple India's Country Manager Maneesh Dhir confirmed his exit from the company on Friday, without specifying any reason. Dhir joined Apple in 2010 and during his tenure, the company's India sales surged from $100 million to $1 billion. This is the second top-level exit for Apple India in two weeks, after its Enterprise Head Sharad Mehrotra quit earlier this month.
