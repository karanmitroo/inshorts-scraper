Five government-owned insurance companies - New India Assurance, United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance, National Insurance and General Insurance, have been cleared by the Cabinet for listing in stock exchanges. This clears the way for the government to accelerate its plans to raise money through disinvestment of equity stakes in PSUs. The government holds 100% stake in all five companies.
