The Panama Canal, expanded to allow bigger vessels to pass at a cost of $5.2 billion, will be inaugurated on Sunday. The enlarged canal will reduce sailing time between Atlantic Ocean ports and Asia up toâ€‹ 16 days for big ships that could not previously fit. The canal authority now hopes that average volumes will rise by 3% per year.
