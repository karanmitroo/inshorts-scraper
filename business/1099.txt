A former lawyer for Martin Shkreli's companies has been convicted of scheming with the former biotech executive to defraud a pharmaceutical firm. He was found guilty of helping Shkreli steal $11 million from Retrophin to pay back investors after Shkreli lost their money. Shkreli, who once raised a drug's price by over 5,000%, was convicted in August of defrauding investors.
