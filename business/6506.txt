Former Times Now Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami has changed the name of his venture 'Republic' to 'Republic TV'. This comes a week after Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint against the usage of the word 'Republic' for commercial purpose, claiming it would breach the Emblems and Names Act. Republic TV may go live before UP Assembly elections, reports said.
