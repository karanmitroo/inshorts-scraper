The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its key interest rates unchanged at up to 1.25% but signalled it still expects one more increase by the end of the year. "Economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year," the Federal Reserve said in its policy statement. It further added that inflation was being watched "closely".
