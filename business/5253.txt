Telecom major Bharti Airtel has modified its ‘fastest network’ commercial campaign by dropping the word “officially” from it after rival Reliance Jio contested the claim. Advertisement regulator ASCI had asked the company to modify or withdraw the commercial by April 11. The modified advertisement pitches Airtel as “India’s fastest network” without the word “officially”, as was in the earlier ad.
