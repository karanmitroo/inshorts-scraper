The International Monetary Fund foresees the global economy expanding less than it had previously forecast, slowed by weaker growth in the United States, Russia and developing economies. It predicted Thursday that global growth will be 3.4% in 2014, below its April forecast of 3.7%, and US growth at just 1.7% - weakest since the recession officially ended five years ago.
