Samsung's Vice Chairman Jae-Yong Lee, who is also the son of the group's Chairman, will be questioned as a suspect in a bribery investigation related to the scandal that led to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's impeachment. Prosecutors are investigating whether the $25 million-worth payment Samsung made to foundations controlled by a Park confidante were in exchange for political favours.
