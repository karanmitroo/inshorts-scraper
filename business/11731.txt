Salt manufacturers in Gujarat have said that they will stop production and supply in the market for three days from Tuesday and protest against the imposition of 5% VAT on industrial salt by the state government. Notably, this is the first time that VAT has been imposed on salt in Gujarat, which accounts for nearly 75% of India's salt production.
