Welcoming the government's decision to invalidate all ₹1000 and ₹500 currency notes from Tuesday midnight, President Pranab Mukherjee has called upon the people not to panic. This move will help unearth unaccounted money as well as counterfeit currency, he added. Mukherjee urged the people to follow the government's guidelines for exchanging the ₹500 and ₹1000 notes available with them.
