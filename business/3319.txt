Liquor firm United Spirits has more 'crorepatis' than Infosys, and all Indian FMCG companies except Hindustan Unilever, reports said. Around 56 executives at United Spirits earned over â‚¹1 crore for 2016-17. An HR consultant said when Vijay Mallya was at the helm of United Spirits, very few people were paid very high salaries, but now it's being run more professionally.
