Former PM Manmohan Singh has claimed that the Narendra Modi-led government won't be able to equal the UPA government's 10-year average GDP growth rate. He further said it is too early to say that there is a reversal in decline seen in the past five quarters. "Every 1% loss of GDP annually costs our nation â‚¹1.5 lakh crore," he added.
