Small and medium businesses were the worst hit by demonetisation and the GST rollout, said Harsh Mariwala, Chairman of consumer goods company Marico. He said in case of Marico, the negative impact is more in the wholesale business in rural areas. He added in case of larger companies, impact was more in the month of June prior to GST launch.
