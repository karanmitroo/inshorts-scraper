Oil major Royal Dutch Shell on Wednesday reported an 89% year-on-year fall in net profit for the quarter ended March to $484 million. Revenue for the quarter fell by 26% to $48.55 billion. The company's $54 billion acquisition of British oil major BG Group and oil prices falling to a 12-year low during the quarter affected the results, analysts said.
