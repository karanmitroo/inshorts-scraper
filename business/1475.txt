The US Justice Department has charged three Chinese citizens with hacking and stealing materials from Moody's Analytics, Siemens, and Trimble. The US authorities charged the three with launching "coordinated and unauthorised" cyber attacks between 2011 and 2017. The alleged hackers gained unauthorised access to Siemens's computer networks and removed about 407 GB of data in 2015 from the network.
