US President Donald Trump has criticised department-store chain Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka's fashion brand, saying, "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly." "She is a great person-always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Trump tweeted. Notably, Nordstrom citing poor sales, said it would drop the brand amid campaigners calling for boycott of stores dealing with Trump family.
