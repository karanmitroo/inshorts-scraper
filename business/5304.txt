UK Member of Parliament John Mann has said that if regulators were indeed probing Barclays over the attempts to identify a whistleblower, the bank's CEO Jes Staley "has to resign". Staley is being investigated for attempting to identify the author of a letter involving a senior executive. Trying to identify the complainant could violate US and UK laws protecting whistleblowers.
