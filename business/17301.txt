European regulators have cleared a key plant of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd in India, which supplies pharmaceutical ingredients, saying that it no longer poses a public health risk. The move comes five months after the US FDA inspected the Toansa plant in India and prohibited Ranbaxy from producing or distributing drugs made there to the US.
