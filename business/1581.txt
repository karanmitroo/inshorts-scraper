Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler has said that the demonetisation rollout was "deeply flawed". Claiming that the introduction of ₹2,000 note was "puzzling", he said the motive to prevent corruption and to move towards a cashless society was undercut by the ₹2,000 note. Thaler said this in an emailed response to a student, the screenshot of which was retweeted by Thaler.
