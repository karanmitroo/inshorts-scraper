KFC has issued a full-page apology to customers after nearly 700 of its 900 outlets across the UK ran out of chicken. The ad shows an empty KFC bucket with the company's name rearranged to spell "FCK". The chicken shortage occurred due to delayed deliveries after KFC switched to a new delivery partner.
