Amrapali's CEO Ritik Kumar Sinha and director Nishant Mukul were arrested over alleged fraud and not paying labour cess of â‚¹4.29 crore to Labour Department. Amrapali received a final recovery notice in March 2017 but when it failed to pay, police took action. The district administration said labour cess is charged for labour's welfare, which the group didn't pay.
