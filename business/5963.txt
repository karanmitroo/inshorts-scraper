Tata Sons has the power to ask shareholders to sell their holdings by passing a special resolution, which could be used to force Cyrus Mistry's family firms to exit, according to reports. These firms own 18.4% in Tata Sons, which could be valued at around $16 billion. Earlier reports stated Ratan Tata was seeking a partner to buy this stake.
