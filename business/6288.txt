Over two crore zero-balance savings bank accounts have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana since the November 8 demonetisation move. The number of Jan Dhan accounts stood at over 27.31 crore. The government had asked the public sector banks to focus on opening these accounts to ensure that unorganised sector workers had access to the formal banking channel.
