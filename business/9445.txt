Bharti Airtel on Saturday said it has received payment from Reliance Jio for additional interconnection points, and sought the new entrant's cooperation for timely testing and commissioning of the ports. Airtel said it will work towards releasing the points “well ahead” of its contractual obligation. Airtel earlier agreed to provide interconnection ports to Jio to support its 15 million customers.
