Jharkhand has become the first state in the country to implement Direct Benefit Transfer in Kerosene. The scheme is aimed at cutting subsidy leakages and has been implemented in the state's four districts currently. With this, kerosene under the Public Distribution System will be sold at a non-subsidised price, and the subsidy will be directly transferred to beneficiaries' bank accounts.
