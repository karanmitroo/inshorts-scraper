Infosys employees will be allowed to wear business casuals on all working days instead of just Fridays from June 1, a company email to its employees said. The move is aimed at arresting attrition and connecting better with the employees, most of whom are in their twenties. Infosys' rivals like TCS, Wipro allow its employees to wear casuals only on Fridays.
