In 1950, a certain portion of the Union Budget was leaked. After the leak, the Budget printing venue was shifted from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to a press on Minto Road. In 1980, a government press in the North Block's basement became the permanent place for Budget printing. To avoid leaks, officials stay in the press till the speech is over.
