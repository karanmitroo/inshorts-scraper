A "feedback and action room" equipped with multiple phone lines, computer systems and a team of young officers has been set up by the Finance Ministry to deal with issues related to GST implementation. The action room, which will function from 8 AM to 10 PM, will act as a quick resource centre for government officials to address their queries.
