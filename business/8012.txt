Tata Sons on Sunday issued a new statement regarding Chairman Cyrus Mistry's ouster, saying that the group would do whatever is needed to deal with the situation. It said that the facts have already been put forward by the group so that Mistry's removal "is seen in the desired perspective". This comes after Mistry's letter hitting back at Tata Sons.
