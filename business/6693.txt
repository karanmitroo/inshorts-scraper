The Income Tax Department has written to RBI informing it about alleged illegal practices by a number of cooperative banks after its probe found "serious" differences in their accounts. A report by the department had said tax officials found that these banks have been involved in generating and routing of black money at an "unprecedented" scale post demonetisation.
