According to commerce ministry data, India’s gold imports plunged 36.5% year-on-year to $3.53 billion in November, due to falling prices. The April-November period witnessed a 7.5% drop in gold imports. With gold being India’s biggest import after oil and electronics, the fall has contributed substantially to reducing the trade deficit to $9.78 billion from $16.2 billion in November 2014.
