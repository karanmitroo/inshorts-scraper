The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate (currently at 7.50%) and the CRR (cash reserve ratio) unchanged in its policy review on Tuesday. However, the RBI said that it would maintain its "accommodative stance on monetary policy." The RBI had reduced rates twice this year, but very few banks reciprocated by reducing interest rates on loans.
