President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday said that India will become a “modern economic power in the world” if schemes like ‘Clean India’ and ‘Digital India’ are implemented successfully. This would require “effectively using our resources” and increasing farm productivity, he added. Further, “We have achieved 7.6% GDP growth despite the... adverse impact of financial crisis of 2008," he stated.
