Private lender Axis Bank posted a profit of â‚¹2,175 crore for the quarter ended December, registering a 14.5% year-on-year rise in profits. However, the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total loans rose to 1.68% compared to 1.38% in the previous quarter. The profit rise was attributed to an increase in non-interest income even as the asset quality deteriorated.
