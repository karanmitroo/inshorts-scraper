The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the manner in which National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has passed order in the Unitech case is "very very disturbing". Unitech moved the SC on December 11 against the tribunal's order allowing the government to take control of the real estate company's management. "Leave should have been taken from us," the SC added.
