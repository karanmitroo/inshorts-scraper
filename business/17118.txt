In a move to promote entrepreneurship culture in the country, finance minister Arun Jaitley proposed a Rs 10,000 crore fund to capitalize start-ups and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The fund will act as a catalyst to attract private capital by way of providing equity, quasi equity, soft loans and other risk capital for start-up companies, Jaitley said.
