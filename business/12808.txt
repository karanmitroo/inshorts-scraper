The Sahara Group on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that it is selling assets which include London-based Grosvenor House hotel, Mumbai-based Hotel Sahara Star, stake in F1 team ‘Force India’ and four aircraft among others. The assets are being sold in order to repay the dues sanctioned by SEBI, so as to free jailed Sahara chief Subrata Roy.
