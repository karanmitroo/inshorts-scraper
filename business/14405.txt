The Central Board of Direct Taxes on Thursday extended the deadline for e-filing income returns and tax audit report, for taxpayers covered under section 44AB to October 31 from the existing date of September 30. The decision comes after three High Court judgements had extended the deadline for the assessees of the respective states on Wednesday.
