The Indian Railways has started a 'Roll on Roll off' (RoRo) service in Tripura to transport petroleum products to the state. Loaded trucks will be carried on flat-wagon goods train to the state under this service. Tripura has been reeling under a fuel crisis owing to the poor condition of roads connecting the state with the rest of the country.
