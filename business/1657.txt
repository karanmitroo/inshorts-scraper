World's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has plunged as much as 29% from last week's record of over $7,880 to around $5,600. However, Bitcoin cash, a rival that split from the original Bitcoin in August offering increased transaction speeds, has jumped nearly 40% since Friday. This comes after developers called off an upgrade proposal that would have caused another split in Bitcoin.
