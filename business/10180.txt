RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday said that public sector banks' employees are “overpaid” at the bottom. Compensation packages are enough to bring in "really qualified" persons, he said, adding that this “over-pay" should be turned into an opportunity to "give talented persons a brighter future". Further, PSBs should get "fresh young talent", and provide extensive training, he added.
