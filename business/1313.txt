Abu Dhabi paid the right price to acquire Leonardo da Vinci's $450 million painting "Salvator Mundi", according to a senior official of the Gulf Emirate. "A lot of us wait for something astonishing, astonishing doesn't happen every day," the official added. The painting will be displayed at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, which opened to the public on November 11.
