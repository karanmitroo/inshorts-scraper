Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Friday said, "I am confident that America will move ahead". This would happen even as the country works through political differences and gets used to the administration of the new US President Donald Trump. Further, Buffett also said that the country has been "blessed" by immigrants, including physicist Albert Einstein.
