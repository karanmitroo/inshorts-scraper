France's pilots' union has claimed British airline easyJet is risking passenger and crew safety by scheduling too many flights, which also caused delays and cancellations. The union said that employees are expected to work over legal flight time limits, and are intimidated if they refuse to do so. However, easyJet rejected the criticism, adding it was "surprised by their action".
