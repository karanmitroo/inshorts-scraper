President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday approved the 2% hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) to central government employees, a move that could benefit 50.68 lakh employees and 54.24 lakh pensioners. DA is provided to employees and pensioners to minimise the impact of price rise on their earnings. Earlier this year, DA was hiked 6% to 125% of the basic pay.
