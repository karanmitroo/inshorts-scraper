The New-Delhi based Vistara Airlines, a shared initiative of Tata and Singapore Airlines, has delayed its launch, due to delay in grant of scheduled Air Operator Permit (AOP). The airline, that was expected to launch services in September, will be able to start only next year, even if it received the permit in the days to come.
