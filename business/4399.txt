Insurance firm AIG said it isn't "unwelcoming to working mothers" amid a lawsuit filed by a former trader who was dismissed while on maternity leave. Jennifer Marlow, who was paid $317,000 yearly, claimed she was dismissed unfairly for seeking flexible working hours after becoming pregnant. However, AIG said Marlow's unwillingness to take lesser pay after restructuring resulted in her dismissal.
