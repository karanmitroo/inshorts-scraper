Citigroup and Lehman Brothers have resolved a financial crisis-era fight over $2.1 billion after Citigroup agreed to give back $1.74 billion to the estate of Lehman Brothers. Citigroup had kept about $2.1 billion that Lehman had on deposit with it for trades during Lehman's 2008 bankruptcy. The money was returned after Lehman argued that it should go to its creditors.
