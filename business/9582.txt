The Centre on Sunday issued fresh flexi-fund guidelines that give states more freedom to spend money under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS). Under the new norms, flexi-funds have been raised from the current 10% to 25% for states and 30% for UTs. According to the Finance Ministry, flexi-funds will offer “flexibility” to states to meet development requirements and drive innovation.
