The benchmark Sensex on Tuesday retreated from one-week highs, and slipped 159.54 points to close at 27,425.73. The 30-share index came under pressure on concerns over economic impact as crude prices continued to slide towards six-year lows and due to profit-booking in shares. The 50-share Nifty also declined in the session and dipped 23.60 points to end at 8,299.40.
