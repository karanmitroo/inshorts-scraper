As per reports, photo messaging application Snapchat will soon launch its news division. The company has reportedly hired CNN's top political correspondent Peter Hamby as Head of News. The move comes after the success of Snapchat's 'discover' feature, launched in January, that allows partner outlets like Vice and CNN to share stories picked from the news of the day.
