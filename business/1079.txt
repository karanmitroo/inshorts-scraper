McDonald's India has warned its customers about "serious compliance risks" at its outlets run by Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) in north and east India. It said these restaurants needed to close down, since they aren't in line with its global standards pertaining to supplies and operations. This comes after CPRL got a new logistics partner and started reopening closed restaurants.
