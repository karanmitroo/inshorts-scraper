Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has said government should exit from maintenance of infrastructure projects, saying it "is incapable to handle" them. This should include big projects like dedicated freight corridors and national highways. He added that privatisation for operation and maintenance shouldn't be limited to infrastructure projects only, but also be extended to jails, schools and colleges.
