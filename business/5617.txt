Plusnet, the BT-owned broadband company, has been fined £880,000 (over ₹7 crore) for continuing to charge some customers even after they cancelled their accounts. An error in the company’s billing system meant cancelled lines were recognised as “live”. As a result, 1,025 customers, who had cancelled the services, continued to be billed and were charged £500,000 (₹4 crore) in total.
