RBI has floated a tender for leasing 12 currency verification systems to help isolate fake currency from deposited demonetised notes. The central bank is currently engaged in counting the piles of old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes. A senior official said it is suspected that the amount of currency deposited with banks during demonetisation could have been bloated with fake notes.
