Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said China has been making “efforts to stall” India’s exports in the country. China has reportedly placed non-tariff barriers like phytosanitary stipulations (trade requirements related to the health of plants) and standardisation measures. India’s merchandise trade deficit with China increased from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $48 billion in 2014-15.
