Fuel traders across the country are protesting against the government's decision to revise fuel prices daily, based on global prices of petroleum products. Traders said they will have to wait for the government's notification to update prices at midnight every day. They added that all petrol pumps are not automated, which will lead to delay in selling fuel at night.
