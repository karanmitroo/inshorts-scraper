Goa Police has filed a charge sheet against four Fabindia employees in a voyeurism case filed against them after Union Minister Smriti Irani's complaint. The accused were arrested in 2015 after Irani alleged that a hidden camera was installed to snoop on customers in a Goa store's trial room. Top company officials had "no role" in the affair, police said.
