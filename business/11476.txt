US-based retail corporation Walmart Stores has filed a lawsuit against Visa, saying the payments network operator was resisting the use of personal identification numbers (PINs) by customers for purchases made on debit cards at its stores. Visa is currently using chip cards verified by signatures to validate transactions and Walmart said this "creates unacceptable risk to customers".
