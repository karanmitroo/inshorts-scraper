Indo-Japanese joint venture Toyota Kirloskar Motor on Wednesday said it is recalling 44,989 units of the multi-utility vehicle Innova manufactured between Feb 2005 and Dec 2008. The recall has been mandated due to an error discovered in the spiral cable mounted on the steering wheel, the company said.
