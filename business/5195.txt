Billionaire Taizo Son, the brother of Japanese giant SoftBank's Chairman Masayoshi Son, has moved to Singapore and blamed Japan's regulations and education system for relocation. "I tried very hard by lobbying the Japanese government: Why donâ€™t we have a regulatory sandbox to bring some innovative ideas?" said Son. He plans to invest $100 million in Southeast Asia within five years.
