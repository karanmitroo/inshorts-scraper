The Central Vigilance Commission has made it mandatory for public sector banks to report frauds of â‚¹1 crore and above. The anti-corruption watchdog will recommend whether a CBI probe can be ordered in such matters. The banks will also have to share details of how the fraud was conducted with other banks to prevent such cases being repeated, officials said.
