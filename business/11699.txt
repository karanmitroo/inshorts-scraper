The revenue growth of the Indian IT industry is expected to stabilise at 11-13%, supported by the sector's expanded coverage and operating efficiency and economic stability in developed countries, ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday. The growth in the sector fell to 13% in 2014-15 from 23.2% during 2010-14 due to sluggish developed economies among other reasons, it added.
