On the occasion of World Habitat Day, the government on Monday unveiled its Urban Development strategy for 20 years, intending to give a push to growing urbanisation while ensuring sustainable development. The policy aims at reducing water and electricity consumption by 50%, generating half of the power by renewable energy sources and enabling over 60% urban travel through public transport.
