Chocolate maker Cadbury has been accused of betraying Christianity after it changed name of its annual "Easter Egg Trail" in the UK to the "Great British Egg Hunt". Further, Church of England accused the company of "airbrushing faith". Cadbury in response said it had rebranded the event in order to appeal to people of all faiths during the Christian festival.
