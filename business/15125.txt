A day after pop-star Taylor Swift slammed Apple Music for offering three-month free trial to subscribers, the company on Sunday reversed its payment policy. Senior executive Eddy Cue tweeted that Apple would pay artists during the 90-day period. Earlier, Swift had written in an open letter that she would not release her latest album "1989" on Apple Music streaming service.
