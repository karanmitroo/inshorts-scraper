The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Friday asked US fast food giant McDonald's and its estranged Indian joint venture partner Vikram Bakshi to consider settling their dispute among themselves. The tribunal asked McDonald's to give an undertaking that the 169 outlets will be allowed to function and asked Bakshi not to pursue criminal cases, till negotiations are on.
