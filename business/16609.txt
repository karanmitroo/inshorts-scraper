The 700-crore deal between Bharti Airtel and Loop Mobile has fallen through because of a huge delay in receiving permission from the Department of Telecom (DoT). Bharti Airtel was supposed to purchase crisis-hit Loop Mobile's Mumbai network. This is the second time under the new government that the DoT has delayed giving formal approvals, jeopardizing lakhs of telecom users.
