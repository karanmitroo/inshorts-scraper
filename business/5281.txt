Vodafone has complained to telecom regulator TRAI that Reliance Jio is still "luring customers" to subscribe to its Summer Surprise offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms. Jio is continuing with this offer in the garb of configuration changes, it said. Jio's continuation of the scheme paints a wrong picture to customers, Vodafone added.
