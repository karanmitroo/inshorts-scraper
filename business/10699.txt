A Delhi court on Saturday cancelled the exemption granted to Vijay Mallya from personal appearance in a case filed for allegedly avoiding summons in a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act violation case. The court further directed Mallya to personally appear before it on September 9. The exemption had been granted in December 2000 in a complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate.
