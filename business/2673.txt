Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said India shouldn't go "chest-thumping" on being the fastest-growing economy without achieving strong GDP expansion for 10 years. India can lecture the world on cultural achievements, but on growth, "let's lecture once we've achieved another 10 years of 8-10%", he advised. Indian economy is still small but "we feel we're a big country", Rajan added.
