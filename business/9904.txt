Market regulator Sebi has relaxed restrictions against 201 entities against which it had taken action over alleged tax evasion and money laundering. The entities, which had been barred from the securities market, were allowed to deal in government securities and invest in exchange-traded funds. Also, they can tender shares lying in their Demat account, except that of any suspended company.
