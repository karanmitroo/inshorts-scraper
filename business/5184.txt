United Airlines is in a legal battle with a parody website that has also collected over 30,000 consumer complaints against the airline. Jeremy Cooperstock, who started Untied.com in 1997, said, "there's no respect for the rights of passengers." United said it wants Untied.com to limit its parody posts and remove contact details of United employees without jurisdiction over customer complaints.
