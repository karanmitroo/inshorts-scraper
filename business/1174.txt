The Finance Ministry said it hasn't provided entire amount towards capital infusion in public sector banks as most banks failed to meet performance target. As part of Indradhanush Plan, the government had proposed to infuse ₹70,000 crore in state-owned banks but infused only ₹51,858 crore. Earlier this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced a ₹2.11 trillion PSU bank recapitalisation plan.
