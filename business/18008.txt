The BSE Sensex on Friday rose to its highest close since Nov-1, on hopes that state elections results on Sunday will show strong support for the main opposition party, BJP, ahead of general elections next year. The Sensex rose 38.72 points, to end at 20,996.53. BJP is perceived by many investors as being more business-friendly.
