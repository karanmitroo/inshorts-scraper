The government Wednesday decided not to appeal against the Bombay High Court order granting tax relief to Vodafone. The government wants to convey a clear message to investors globally that it will be fair and transparent, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. The government also asked the IT department to apply the Vodafone principle to all similar transfer pricing cases.
