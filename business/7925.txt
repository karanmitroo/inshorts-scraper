The government on Wednesday dismissed rumours of plans to demonetise ₹50 and ₹100 notes. This comes after reports claimed that PM Narendra Modi will soon address the nation and invalidate the notes. The government also clarified that complete secrecy was maintained regarding demonetisation before November 8 and quashed claims that the cost of demonetisation is more than its benefits.
