SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi has said the markets regulator is keeping a close tab on share price movement of Infosys. This comes after Infosys shares plunged nearly 10% on Friday, wiping out ₹22,519 crore from its market valuation, after Vishal Sikka resigned as CEO. Shares further fell over 5% on Monday despite a ₹13,000 crore buyback announcement by the company.
