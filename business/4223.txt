Japan's SoftBank Group's 59-year-old billionaire CEO Masayoshi Son on Wednesday said he's not stepping down anytime soon and will spend the next decade identifying a successor. "I feel energised. I couldn't possibly retire," added Son, who said successor would most likely come from the company's management ranks. Son is left without a successor since COO Nikesh Arora quit last year.
