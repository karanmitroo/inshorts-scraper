The Supreme Court has rejected Sahara Chief Subrata Roy's plea seeking an extension of time to pay â‚¹600 crore to market regulator SEBI. "You must make the scheduled payment by February 6 to stay out of jail," the SC said to Roy, currently on parole. Roy cited demonetisation and economic slowdown as reasons for the request to seek time extension.
