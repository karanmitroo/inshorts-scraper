Coal India Ltd shares jumped to a near three-year high on Thursday after Reuters reported that prime minister-designate Narendra Modi was exploring an overhaul of the state behemoth, a step that an investor said would unlock more value in the firm.
The stock rose as much as 8.22% in early trade to Rs 401, the highest since August 2011.
