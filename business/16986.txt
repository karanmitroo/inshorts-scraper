German car-maker Mercedes Benz has been found guilty of manipulating prices for after-sales services in China, according to China's official news agency, Xinhua. The report comes after the anti-trust regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), probed the auto-industry following domestic media complaints. The company can be fined with up to 10% of its China revenues of last year.
