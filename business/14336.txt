Volkswagen Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller has said that the company may start recalling vehicles affected in the diesel emissions scandal in January, and may fix them by end-2016. Matthias added that Volkswagen Group will henceforth become smaller and decentralised, giving more responsibility to individual brands, and will make scrutiny of models stricter.
