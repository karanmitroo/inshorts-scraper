Canada's Niko Resources has put up for sale its 10% stake in Reliance Industries' KG-D6 gas block, saying there is uncertainty over long-term price outlook in India. The company decided to sell the stake, also due to lower-than-expected hike in natural gas prices. The government had announced raising natural gas price to $5.61 per million British thermal unit from $4.2.
