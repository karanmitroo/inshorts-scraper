The Financial Stability Report released by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday said the ongoing initiatives like GST will push the economic growth to 7.3% in the current fiscal year in terms of gross value added (GVA). Further, reforms in FDI, real estate, and revival in external demand are likely to contribute to a better growth, the report said.
