United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz has asked employees to commit to a "zero tolerance" policy on sexual harassment. "More important than a change in policies is a change in mindset, one where we listen to one another," Munoz said. Earlier, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's sister Randi Zuckerberg had alleged sexual harassment by a male passenger on an Alaska Airlines flight.
