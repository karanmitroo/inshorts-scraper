Tamil Nadu government on Monday issued a cancellation order for the 71.34 acres of plot allowed to Coca Cola in Perundurai. Allotted to the beverage company in June 2013, the land was allegedly revoked due to Coca-Cola's non-compliance of terms and conditions of the lease deed. There is a history of protests against this land from residents fearing environmental damage.
