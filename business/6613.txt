Telecom major BT lost over $8.7 billion (around ₹60,000 crore) or nearly a fifth of its value after it revealed that an accounting scandal at its Italian business was much worse than originally thought. The company's stock plunged as much as 19% on Tuesday. The company said in October it had discovered “inappropriate management behaviour” in its Italian division.
