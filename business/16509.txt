According to Tehelka magazine's political editor Ramesh Ramchandran, Robert Vadra, along with some other VIPs, misused their position to upgrade economy class tickets to business class every time they flew Jet Airways. Vadra was upgraded to first class "at least eight times" on the Delhi-London sector, Ramachandran claimed. Even Vadra's children and mother were upgraded to premier class, he said.
