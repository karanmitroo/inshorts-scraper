Morgan Stanley has been sued by over 60,000 of its current and ex-employees for mismanaging its $8 billion employee retirement plan and charging excessive fees for poorly performing funds. The suit alleged that the company maximised profits by causing heavy losses to plan members. Recently, similar lawsuits have been filed against several US employers over excessive fees for retirement plans.
