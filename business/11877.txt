Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday at the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting said world governments cannot continue relying on central banks to take the lead in spurring growth and should consider boosting spending. "The time is ripe for a re-evaluation of the fiscal policy space, with a greater focus placed on public investment," he added.
