The State Bank of India has temporarily blocked major digital wallets including Paytm, MobiKwik and FreeCharge from its net banking service. The move disables SBI customers from transferring money from their bank account to the mobile wallets. SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has said that the service has been blocked following recent breaches and security reasons.
