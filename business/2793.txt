A woman is suing JetBlue on suffering burns after a flight attendant allegedly spilled hot tea on her. In the lawsuit, she claimed the cup was "filled to the brim", adding the tea was "capable of causing disfiguring burns" and wasn't "fit for human consumption". She filed the lawsuit three years after the incident, claiming JetBlue 'treated her like dirt'.
