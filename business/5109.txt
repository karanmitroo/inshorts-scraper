After journalist Arnab Goswami hinted Karan Johar was behind his exit from Times Now, Johar said, "I feel important. I didn’t know I had power to do that." "I didn’t know I could ask anyone to leave this room," Johar added. Earlier, Goswami said a film director had complained to a media proprietor about questions raised on Johar's film castings.
