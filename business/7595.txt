The Reserve Bank of India on Monday said that bank customers would be able to withdraw deposits made in current legal tender notes beyond current limits. This means that if valid notes worth ₹4,000 are deposited, the withdrawal limit would rise by ₹4,000 over and above the weekly withdrawal limit of ₹24,000. Notably, the move aims to increase currency circulation.
