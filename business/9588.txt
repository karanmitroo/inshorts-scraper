The government on Monday approved the Human Resource Development Ministry's proposal to set up a Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) to provide funds for research-oriented infrastructure in premier institutions like IITs and IIMs. HEFA is expected to raise up to ₹20,000 crore for funding world-class labs and mobilise CSR funds for promoting research in these institutions on a grant basis.
