Diageo, the drinks company behind Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, and Guinness, is to pay HMRC £107 million (₹885 crore) under the "Google tax" crackdown aimed at multinationals. It said HMRC was preparing to demand additional tax and interest for 2015 and 2016. "Diageo does not believe that it falls within the scope of the new diverted profits tax regime," it stated.
