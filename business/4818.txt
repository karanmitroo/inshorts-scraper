Shares of United Continental Holdings soared to an all-time high on Tuesday, rising by 5%, despite being linked to a rabbit's death, dragging a passenger, and wrong-way flights. This edged up the company's market capitalisation by $867 million (nearly â‚¹5,600 crore). The rise was due to United posting strong revenue, as despite consumer dissatisfaction, passengers took its flights.
