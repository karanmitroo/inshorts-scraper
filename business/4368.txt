Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called activist investor Jana Partners as "greedy bastards" interested only in profiting from a forced sale of the company. "[T]hey just want to...make hundreds of millions of dollars," Mackey said. "That's my baby. I'm going to protect my kid, and they've got to knock Daddy out if they want to take it over," he added.
