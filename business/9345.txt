Ahead of the forthcoming spectrum auction, UK-based Vodafone has injected a record â‚¹47,700 crore ($7.1 billion) into its Indian unit, Vodafone India. The equity infusion, claimed by the company as the "largest ever" FDI infusion in India, will help Vodafone buy more spectrum, expand infrastructure, and reduce debt. Notably, this comes after the launch of Reliance Jio earlier this month.
