The Telecom Commission on Saturday approved the sale of all available spectrum across all frequencies at reserve prices based on TRAI's recommendations. This comes after the telecom industry called for auctioning only a part of the available spectrum in the​ 700 MHz band. The government is expected to make ₹5.26 lakh crore from the spectrum auction.
