The Supreme Court has refused to extend the July 15 deadline for payment of ₹552 crore by the Sahara Group to a dedicated SEBI-Sahara refund account. The firm has so far deposited ₹1,500 crore with the refund account towards an assurance of payment of ₹2,000 crore. Sahara has been asked to pay back money it had raised illegally from investors.
