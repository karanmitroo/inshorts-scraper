Jeff Bezos-led US e-commerce giant Amazon is now worth more than 2.6 times its competitor Walmart at $718 billion. This comes despite Walmart having around three times Amazon's annual revenue and profit last year. Walmart is now valued at $271 billion after it lost over $35 billion in value in 3 days as its December quarter online sales missed expectations.
