The Comptroller and Auditor General on Friday said savings in LPG subsidy paid directly to consumers was only ₹1,764 crore, stating that about 92% of the ₹23,300 crore savings in 2015-16 were due to falling oil prices. This follows the Centre’s claims that it saved ₹22,000 crore due to the ‘Give it Up’ campaign, and direct bank transfers of subsidies.
