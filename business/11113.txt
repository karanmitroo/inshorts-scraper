State-owned mining giant National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) and manganese miner Manganese Ore India Limited (MOIL) have announced share buyback programmes worth around ₹8,400 crore. The move will help the government in realising its disinvestment target of ₹56,500 crore for the 2016-17 fiscal, as the government owns 80% in both the PSUs.
