The Madras High Court on Thursday revoked the ban on Pepsi and Coca-Cola from using Thamirabarani river water. The companies had been banned from using the river's water on a plea that they were depriving farmers of their livelihood. They paid only â‚¹0.37 per 1,000 litres of water and sold their beverages at a much higher cost, the plea contended.
