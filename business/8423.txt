After Cyrus Mistry criticised the decision to remove him as Chairman, Tata Sons said Mistry's letter damaged the group in front of its 6 lakh-plus employees. “It is unforgivable that Mr. Mistry has attempted to besmirch the image of the Group in the eyes of the employees,” a statement read. Notably, Mistry claimed that Tata faces an $18 billion write-down.
