Easing the process of obtaining PAN card, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in a recent notification made Elector's Photo Identity Card (EPIC) and Aadhaar a valid proof of an individual's date of birth. Previously, they were only considered a valid proof of identity and address. The decision was taken to ease creating inter-links between PAN, Aadhaar and EPIC.
