The extraordinary general meeting called by Tata Trusts on Monday to remove former chairman Cyrus Mistry from the board of Tata Sons ended after about 45 minutes. Mistry, whose family owns 18.4% in Tata Sons, did not attend the meeting and was ousted after shareholders with 80% ownership in the company voted in favour of his removal, according to sources.
