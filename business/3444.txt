Qatar on Monday filed a legal complaint at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against a trade boycott by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and United Arab Emirates. By formally requesting consultations with the three countries, Qatar has triggered a 60-day deadline for them to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO and potential retaliatory trade sanctions.
