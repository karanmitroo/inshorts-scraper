Hotels and restaurants within 500 metres of national and state highways cannot serve liquor, the Supreme Court clarified on Friday. Earlier, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had suggested that the order would not apply to hotels and restaurants but SC has rejected this view. Further, in areas with population under 20,000, the distance will be reduced to 220 metres.
