Singer-songwriter and former member of the Beatles Paul McCartney has sued Sony's music publishing arm, to reclaim copyrights to 267 Beatles songs that pop star Michael Jackson acquired two decades before his death. Jackson had outbid McCartney for publishing rights to the songs in 1985, paying $47.5 million (over â‚¹323 crore) to obtain the collection.
