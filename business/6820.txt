Flight data firm FlightStats has issued a clarification after media company Bloomberg used its data to portray Air India as the world's third worst airline. Bloomberg portrayed Air India in negative light, and FlightStats by no means endorsed this, it said. Bloomberg applied its journalistic license to invert FlightStats' result to highlight the percentage of delayed flights, it added.
