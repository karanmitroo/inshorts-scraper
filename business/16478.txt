Benchmark share indices on Monday ended lower, amid weak Asian cues, as investors turned cautious ahead of Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy review meet Tuesday.
The 30-share Sensex ended down 134 points at 28,560, while the 50-share Nifty ended down 32 points at 8,556. Oil stocks were among top losers due to profit taking after a sharp rally Friday.
