PM Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the government’s first gold coin, alongside sovereign bond and monetisation schemes. The schemes are aimed at issuing gold bonds to reduce imports and also channeling part of idle gold worth ₹5.4 lakh crore into the banking system. "India has 20,000 tonnes of idle gold and that is why we are poor," Modi said.
