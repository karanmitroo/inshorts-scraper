The BSE Sensex on Tuesday lost 285.83 points to close at 24,539.00, while the NSE Nifty fell by 100.40 points to settle at 7,455.55. Analysts attributed the losses to selling of blue-chip stocks. Market sentiment remained under pressure as the RBI kept its key policy rates unchanged, opting to wait for the governmentâ€™s annual budget statement in February-end.
