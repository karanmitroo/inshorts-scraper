The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on Sunday released 13.4 million files as part of a leak titled 'Paradise Papers'. Covering the period from 1950 to 2016, the documents reveal details of offshore dealings linked to UK's Queen Elizabeth and US President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The bulk of the data comes from Appleby, a Bermuda-based legal services provider.
