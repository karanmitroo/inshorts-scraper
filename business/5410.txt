The New Zealand Post has started delivering KFC in Tauranga city, to stem major revenue losses as the number of people using the postal service continues to fall. NZ Post spokesperson Mike Stewart said, "we want to survive for another 100 years but we urgently need to diversify our business." KFC may start delivering food across half the country.
