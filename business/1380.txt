Nestle India on Monday said that Maggi complied with the latest guidelines of food regulator FSSAI and it doesn't add any ash to its noodles. This comes after Nestle was fined by a UP district administration after Maggi allegedly failed lab tests. MD Suresh Narayanan said the company will decide on the future course of action after studying the order.
