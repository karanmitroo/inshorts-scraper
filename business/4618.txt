ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar has drawn ₹7.85 crore as total remuneration in 2016-17, a jump of nearly 64% from a year ago. The hike was primarily driven by performance bonus, which Kochhar had forgone a year ago owing to the bank's weak financial results. In 2015-16, Kochhar was the third-highest paid bank chief with a pay of ₹4.79 crore.
