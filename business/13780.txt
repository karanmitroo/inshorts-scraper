Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) reported a net loss of ₹320.50 crore for the quarter ended September, compared to a profit of ₹850.21 crore in the year-ago period. "The loss was mainly because crude oil dropped by $10 per barrel resulting in an inventory loss of ₹1,400 crore. Also there was a foreign exchange loss of ₹180 crore," HPCL Director (Finance) said.
