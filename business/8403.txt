Volkswagen expects the shift to electric cars to cost over 10,000 jobs in coming years, the carmaker's Human Resources Chief Karlheinz Blessing was reported to have said. Volkswagen's works council is reportedly in talks with the company's brand management over a turnaround plan and expects up to 25,000 staff to be cut over the next decade as older workers retire.
