Citing that the Indian rupee "will become more attractive as an investment currency", RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said that the current monetary policy stance is "just right" to meet the inflation target of 5% by March 2017. He added that reducing dollar borrowing and deepening the country's debt market would increase India's resilience against Federal Reserve's interest rate hike.
