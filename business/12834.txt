The government on Monday banned the zero-duty import of capital goods for the generation and transmission of power, as per the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme. The decision aims to promote the production of power equipment and the domestic capital goods industry. The EPCG scheme permits import of capital goods at zero-custom duty for pre-production, production, and post-production.
