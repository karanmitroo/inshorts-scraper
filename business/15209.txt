China Railway Rolling Stock Corp Ltd will reportedly be supplying 14 metro trains with 112 carriages to Kolkata. The city is looking to replace its old trains in the south-north metro line to ease the transportation pressure. This is reportedly the biggest such contract for a Chinese company in South Asia. Several other Indian CMs are eyeing Chinese investment.
