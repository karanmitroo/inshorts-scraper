India-born former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta, who served a two-year prison term on insider trading charges, has admitted that he made "errors and misjudgements". He further apologised for letting his fellow IIT associates down and expressed "regret" that five years of his life were taken away from him. He, however, said jail term has made him a "better person".
