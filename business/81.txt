As the February 28 deadline for mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance by prepaid wallet customers has expired, customers who haven't completed the KYC won't be able to reload their wallet or send money to others. However, customers can undertake transactions with the available balance. Facilities like recharging mobile number can also be used through card payments on the wallet.
