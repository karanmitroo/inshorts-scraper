After Arnab Goswami's Republic TV was ranked most-watched news channel in India in its launch week by Broadcast Audience Research Council, rival english media channels have reportedly pulled out of the council. Moreover, they have demanded an inquiry. Earlier, the News Broadcasters Association asked BARC to suspend release of Republic's viewership ratings till it complied with certain TRAI norms.
