Individuals selling old jewellery to traders or hostel accommodation provided to students by educational institutions will not be subject to GST, the government has clarified. Sale of old jewellery is not taxable as it is not a transaction made in the course of running a business. Further, GST will also not apply on sale of old cars or two-wheelers.
