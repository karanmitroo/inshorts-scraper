A Moscow restaurant Valenok will accept Bitcoin if there's demand, making it the first restaurant in the capital to do so. "We want to keep pace with the time...we will even install special ATMs to exchange Bitcoins for providing proper level of service to our guests," it said. Burger King in Russia also said it would accept Bitcoin by year-end.
