South Korea's LG electronics today said that it will work with German automaker Volkswagen to develop a connected car platform that will enable vehicles to communicate with external devices. The technologies built will allow drivers to control devices like lights and security systems in their homes. Further, they will also develop an alerting system that will provide 'suggestions' to drivers.
