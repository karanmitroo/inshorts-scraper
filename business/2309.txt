Aadhaar's official Twitter handle wished its followers a Happy Dussehra with an illustration of arrows shot at Ravana. Reacting to it, a user tweeted how they would issue an Aadhaar to Ravana. Aadhaar's handle replied, "Not a resident of India and hence, not eligible." Another user tweeted, "Durga Mata has many hands how many fingerprints will be valid for her."
