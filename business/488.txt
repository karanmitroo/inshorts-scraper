The UK's Lloyds Banking Group has banned its customers from buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin using credit cards as it fears their falling value could leave it with huge debt. The ban applies to Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA customers. Notably, Bitcoin's value has plunged by over half since it reached its high of $20,000 in December 2017.
