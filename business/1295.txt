Denmark's Danske Bank has attracted 11,500 clients to an investment service provided by a robot named 'June' in just over half a year. June lets customers choose a risk category and provides recommendation on different funds to invest in, based on an algorithm. Danske's product chief Jakob Beck Thomsen has said the robot "is not a job killer".
