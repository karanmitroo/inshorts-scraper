Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra has said that clean technology is the single biggest business opportunity for the next couple of decades. "Anyone not looking at these opportunities is going to miss out on growth," he added. "We've just been believers for a while, haven't been making any money, but now the tipping point seems to be reached," Mahindra said.
