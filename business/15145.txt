Nokia has announced its plans to start designing and licensing handsets again in 2016, once an agreement with Microsoft allows it. The company had sold its phone business to Microsoft in 2014 following declining sales and tough competition with other phone brands. Microsoft may reportedly write of all or part of the $7.2 billion it paid for Nokia's handset unit.
