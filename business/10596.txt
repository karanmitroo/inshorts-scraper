Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has said a cap on the GST rate in the Constitutional amendment bill, as demanded by the Congress, is not "feasible". There is a "broad consensus" on the bill and only Tamil Nadu, being a manufacturing state, has opposed it, he added. The GST bill is likely to be taken up in the upcoming Parliament session.
