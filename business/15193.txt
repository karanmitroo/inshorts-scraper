Waitlisted train ticket holders have been offered an option to buy an airline ticket for the day of the train journey or a day after, at a competitive fare by IRCTC. The air tickets will be cheaper by as much as 30-40%, a spokesperson said. A GoAir-IRCTC tie-up has sold about 100 tickets under the scheme in the past month.
