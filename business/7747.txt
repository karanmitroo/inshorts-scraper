Global financial services major Goldman Sachs has predicted a deceleration in India’s GDP growth at 6.8% this fiscal, down from 7.6% in 2015-16, due to the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes. Goldman Sachs said, the liquidity shortage would be a significant constraint on the domestic activity following demonetisation, which will affect the GDP growth.
