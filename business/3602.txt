Reliance Jio has reportedly submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Human Resource to provide free WiFi in around 38,000 colleges across the country. The facility will reportedly benefit 3 crore students, who will be able to access the government's National Knowledge Network. A tender will be floated to give other companies a fair chance, according to a government source.
