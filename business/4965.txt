IT giant Infosys said it plans to hire 10,000 US workers in the next two years and open four technology centres in the US, in order to move over H-1B visa-related issues. The move comes amid Infosys and TCS being accused of displacing US workers' jobs by flying in foreigners on temporary visas to service their clients in the country.
