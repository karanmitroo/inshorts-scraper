Brazilian airline GOL has agreed to pay $1.3 million to an indigenous tribe of the Amazon forest as compensation for "spiritual damage" caused to their land by a 2006 plane crash. The tribe, which no longer hunts or farms on the land, believes that the crash left the land "cursed" due to the loss of 154 lives in the accident.
