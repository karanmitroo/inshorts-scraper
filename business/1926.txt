Calling tax-paying a "patriotic duty", Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said, "You can't have an economy where the size of the shadow economy is much bigger than the apparent economy itself." He said that paying taxes is always a fundamental duty of every citizen. The government is "extremely transparent" when it comes to banking matters, he added.
