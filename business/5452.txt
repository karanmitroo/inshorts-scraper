US internet providers Comcast Corporation, Verizon Communications and AT&T have said that they would not sell customers' internet browsing information. This comes after the US senate passed a bill repealing Obama-era internet privacy rules, allowing the providers to sell customers' browser history to advertisers. The bill will become a law after being approved by US President Donald Trump.
