The government on Thursday scraped the minimum export price (MEP) on onions to encourage exports. Earlier this month, the government had also slashed the MEP on onions to $400 per tonne from $700 to increase exports. MEP is the price below which no trader is allowed to export and a rise in MEP reduces exports and improves local supply.
