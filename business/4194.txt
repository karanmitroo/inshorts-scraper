Infosys on Friday said its internal audit committee found no evidence supporting a whistleblower’s allegations of irregularities related to its acquisition of Israeli automation technology firm Panaya. Earlier, this year a whistleblower sent an anonymous letter to regulator SEBI alleging wrongdoings by Infosys in the deal. Infosys acquired Panaya for ₹1,250 crore in cash in 2015.
