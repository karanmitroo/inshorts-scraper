The government is reportedly planning to make Aadhar-based authentication mandatory at the time of registration of documents such as sale, purchase and transfer of property. The move is aimed to curb the use of black money for transaction in property dealings. The government recently made Aadhaar card mandatory for getting Permanent Account Number (PAN) and filing Income Tax Returns.
