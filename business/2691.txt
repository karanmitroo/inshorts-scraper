Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said demonetisation hasn't been able to identify black money hoarders since most of it is back. Adding that tax collection has gone up by only ₹10,000 crore, he said, "Not too much money came in voluntary disclosure". "One has to see gains of at least ₹2 lakh crore to justify demonetisation exercise,” he added.
