A journalist has requested the Supreme Court to direct the government to let Sri Tirumala Tirupati Venkateswara temple exchange ₹8.29 crore of banned notes donated by devotees. The man, in his petition said, non-acceptance of the devotees' offerings was discriminatory and meant that their wishes will remain 'unfulfilled'. This is the world's second richest temple with assets worth ₹50,000 crore.
