New Development Bank (NDB) President KV Kamath on Saturday said everything's going right for India at present, and the third largest Asian economy will witness a "sudden uptick" in fortunes in 12-18 months. This is on account of positive control over inflation, which is leading to a "dramatic fall" in interest rates and passage of GST, among others, he stated.
