German carmaker Volkswagen said on Friday that the company is to take a â‚¬16.2 billion ($18.2 billion) hit in its 2015 accounts related to a diesel-emissions scandal identified in the US last year. The announcement came following a deal with US environmental authorities which proposed the carmaker would have to buy back almost 500,000 cars equipped with the cheat device.
