Global food major Nestle on Thursday said that Maggi noodles has regained a 57% market share in India after reporting sustained recovery. This comes nearly one year after Maggi was relaunched, following a five-month ban in 2015. Food regulator FSSAI had banned Maggi after it was declared "unsafe" for consumption due to the presence of lead content beyond permissible limits.
