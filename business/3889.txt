Teen clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch on Monday said it's no longer up for sale, and will instead focus on fixing the business itself. The news sent Abercrombie shares plummeting 10% in premarket trading, bringing its value down to $740 million. This comes at a time when several rivals have filed for bankruptcy in the last two years, including Aeropostale.
