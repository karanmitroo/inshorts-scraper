Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka has said that transforming the culture of a company is “difficult” but the challenge is to transition “without losing values” and “ethos”. “It is very, very tough. Everybody says it is tough, but when you do it in reality...you realise that it is much more difficult than it seems,” Sikka stated.
