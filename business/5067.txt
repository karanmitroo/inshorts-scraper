TV journalist Arnab Goswami's media venture Republic TV has rolled out an outdoor marketing campaign with the phrase “the nation still wants to know”. This comes days after Times Group served Goswami with a legal notice in order to trademark “the nation wants to know” phrase. In response, Goswami had said "every Indian has a right to use that phrase".
