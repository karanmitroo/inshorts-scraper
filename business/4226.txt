The government has said that no ongoing or future projects can be advertised by real estate developers without registering them first with the new regulator. This will be under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, which came into force in May. Developers are required to get ongoing and new projects registered with regulatory authorities within three months, ending July.
