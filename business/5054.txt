Russian airline Aeroflot representatives have said it is reasonable for female flight attendants to face financial penalties if they are deemed overweight. They stated that part of the reason people pay for tickets is the appearance of its employees. A group of female employees, self-labelled "old, fat, and ugly", attempted to sue Aeroflot for discrimination over age, weight and appearance.
