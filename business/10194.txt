Insurance companies will potentially have to pay more tax after the Goods and Services Tax is implemented, according to reports. The types of tax will reportedly increase as the Centre and states will be two stakeholders and the calculations of input-output tax credits will be done separately for states. Insurance policies are also expected to cost more from April 2017.
