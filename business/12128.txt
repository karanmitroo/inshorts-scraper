NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya on Saturday said that India is better placed as a cohesive unit than the European Union (EU). India's growth rate in the next 15-30 years will return to 8-10%, he added. Replying to a question on India often being called a "noisy democracy", Panagariya said, "You hear the noise, I hear the music."
