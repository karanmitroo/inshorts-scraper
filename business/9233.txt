The government on Monday released draft rules for registration, payment, and invoices under the Goods and Services Tax regime which will be finalised by the GST Council on September 30. These guidelines provide for online registration by residents within three days of applying and aim to minimise the physical interface between taxpayers and the authorities to check corruption and harassment.
