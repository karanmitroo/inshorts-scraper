Martin Sorrell, the CEO of world's largest advertising and public relations company WPP, has said that he remains "very bullish" on India. He said GST and demonetisation were in the nature of absorbing short-term pain for long-term gain. Sorrell added, "I would say generally brand India is in strong shape. Under (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi, it has got considerably stronger."
