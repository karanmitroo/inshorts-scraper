Irish company Primark has recalled thousands of pairs of men's flip-flops after discovering they contain a cancer-causing chemical. This is the third product recall Primark has issued this year and a full refund is being offered to all customers. However, a Primark spokesperson said, "At the levels found in the flip-flop...health and safety risk to customers is minimal."
