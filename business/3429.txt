Mahindra Group's Anand Mahindra, who shared images showing potholes covered with creative pieces of street art, has offered to help the Mysore-based artist through his foundation. After a Twitter user asked Mahindra to acknowledge the artist Badal Nanjundaswamy in his post, the businessman asked people to put him in touch with him. Nanjundaswamy noticed the tweets and responded to Mahindra.
