German carmaker Volkswagenâ€™s sales rose 7.1% in September, the largest monthly gain in two-and-a-half years, the company said on Friday. The growth was attributed to a 20% jump in China, its biggest market, and persistent growth in Europe, the company added. Further, the 6.3% gain in its home region was the company's second-biggest monthly gain this year.
