Cellular operators' body COAI's Director General Rajan Mathews has said, "The (telecom) industry cannot afford to bid for any more spectrum before the latter part of 2018 or early 2019." He said telecom sector needs some time to settle before being able to spend on spectrum at another auction. He added telcos are in the midst of expanding 4G services.
