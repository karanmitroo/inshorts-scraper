World's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores is changing its legal name to 'Walmart' after 47 years, effective February 1. The company said the move shows its growing emphasis on serving shoppers in different ways beyond just physical stores but also online, on their mobile devices, and through pickup and delivery.
