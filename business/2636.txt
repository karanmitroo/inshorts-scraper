The Income Tax Department has announced plans to launch Project Insight, which will track social media accounts and gather information on anomalies between income declarations and spending patterns of users. It aims to trace black money and tax evasion by monitoring high-value transactions. Officials said that the project, which is currently being beta-tested, is likely to be launched next month.
