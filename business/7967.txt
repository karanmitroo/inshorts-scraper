Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday clarified that if the new ₹2,000 note does not lose colour, it may be fake. "The new currency notes leak colour when wet, because that’s the nature of the paper the notes are made from," Das stated. This comes after videos of people showing the new notes losing colour surfaced on the Internet.
