Sandwich chain Pret A Manger has been forced to backtrack on a work experience scheme which would have offered 16-18 year olds free sandwiches instead of pay. This came after social media backlash, following which the company pledged to pay participants, instead of just giving them free food. It had launched the scheme for 500 UK teenagers amid staff shortages.
