Contesting allegations of "mismanagement" and "oppression" by ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry, Tata Sons said Mistry himself had sought guidance from Ratan Tata. "Issues which were proper and normal...before October 2016 suddenly became weapons of interference and oppression," Tata Sons argued. Two Mistry family firms have moved National Company Law Tribunal after Mistry's ouster on October 24, 2016.
