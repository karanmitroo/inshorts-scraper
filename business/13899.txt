Indian Oil is reportedly planning to double its pipeline network in India by 2020-21 by investing around ₹32,000 crore. As a part of its project, the company eyes a 17,000 km-pipeline network by 2017 from the present 11,221 km at ₹12,000 crore. The pipeline network contributed to 38% of IOC's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) in FY15.
