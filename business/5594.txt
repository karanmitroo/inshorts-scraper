FMCG major Hindustan Unilever has filed a petition in Bombay High Court against dairy major Amul, seeking removal of its latest ice-cream advertisement. HUL said Amul has been airing misleading ads that make factually incorrect statements, and that the ad has created apprehensions among customers about frozen desserts. Amul's ad says, "Eat real ice-cream and not vanaspati-based frozen desserts."
