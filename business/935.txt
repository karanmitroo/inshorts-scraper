The Finance Ministry on Wednesday said that supply of food or drink provided by a mess or canteen to students and staff is taxable at 5% without Input Tax Credit. This is irrespective of whether the service is provided by the educational institution itself or the institution outsources the activity to an outside contractor, the ministry added.
