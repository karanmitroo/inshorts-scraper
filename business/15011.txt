Samsung Electronics will reportedly launch a new version of the Galaxy Note phablet in mid-August 2015 in a bid to revive sales after a sluggish second quarter. This is an early launch for the company as the Note 3 and 4 had been launched in September. The move also puts Samsung’s product ahead of Apple’s to gain a head start.
