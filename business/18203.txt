Number of train tickets booked in the past six months has decreased by 3.68% as compared to last year, despite trains running full. The number of non-suburban passengers was 1,982.35 million during April-September as against 2,058.03 million in the same period last year. Ticket-less journey is blamed to be the reason behind this decline.
