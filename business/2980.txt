Infosys Co-founder Nandan Nilekani has reportedly postponed a 2-month visit to the US to stay back in Bengaluru and is "seriously considering" a formal role at Infosys. According to reports, Nilekani could come back as non-executive chairman and play an interim role to stabilise the company and oversee the appointment of the next CEO after Vishal Sikka resigned last week.
