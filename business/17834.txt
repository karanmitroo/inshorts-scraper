Ahead of the Auto Expo 2014 in New Delhi, carmaker Ford on Monday unveiled the Ford Figo Concept, a compact sedan for the global B segment. However, no announcement of when it is expected to hit the market was made. The compact sedan segment, which comprised almost a third of total sales in 2013, is Indiaâ€™s most competitive segment.
