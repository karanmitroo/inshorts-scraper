A McDonald's billboard with an ad for its breakfast burrito went viral on social media for making a joke about joint-rolling. The billboard features an image of the burrito alongside large lettering that reads, “Usually, when you roll something this good, it’s illegal!” The McDonald's Corporation has, however, said the billboard "doesn't meet our standards and is being taken down".
