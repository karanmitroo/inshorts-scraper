Billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway could get a $29 billion (around ₹2 lakh crore) boost to its book value under tax-rate cuts advocated by President-elect Donald Trump, according to banking major Barclays. Berkshire has jumped 8% since Trump won the election, amid expectations of rising interest rates. Earlier, Buffett had supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race.
