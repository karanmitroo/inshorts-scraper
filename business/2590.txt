US bank JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon said he would 'fire in a second' any JPMorgan employee trading Bitcoin for being "stupid". He said the cryptocurrency "won't end well" and called it a "fraud". "[I]f you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in Bitcoin than US dollars," he added.
