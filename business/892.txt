Jet Airways has prohibited passengers from carrying smart luggage, which includes devices with non-removable batteries, on its aircraft from January 15. This comes after the International Air Transport Association banned such baggage on a passenger aircraft worldwide. Smart luggage also includes devices with integrated lithium batteries, motors, power banks, Bluetooth, GPS or Wi-Fi technology.
