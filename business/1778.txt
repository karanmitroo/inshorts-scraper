Industries which do not pay minimum wages to their workers have no right to continue, the Delhi High Court has said. It added that non-payment of minimum wages was "unconscionable and unpardonable". The court made these observations while allowing a plea by a gardener against his employer, Central Secretariat Club, on the issue of non-payment of wages.
