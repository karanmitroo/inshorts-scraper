Tata Sons ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry has denied taking a legal route against the company's decision to remove him, according to an official statement by Shapoorji Pallonji Group. This comes after Tata's Board on Monday removed Mistry from the Chairman's position and Ratan Tata took over as the Interim Chairman. Mistry was the sixth Chairman of the Tata Group.
