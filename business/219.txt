The National Organisation of Bank Workers has claimed that PNB transferred 18,000 employees following a directive by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) after the $1.77-billion PNB fraud. CVC advised state-owned banks to transfer the officers who have completed three years in a particular branch. "We are not aware of this. We do not have any information," PNB's spokesperson has said.
