Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said GST has "stabilised in a very short time in India," as compared to several other countries. He added that this provides an opportunity to widen the base of GST and further rationalise the rates in the future. He further said GST has brought about an entire change in the country's indirect tax system.
