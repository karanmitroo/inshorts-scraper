Outgoing NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya has said closures of 18-20 sick public sector units (PSUs) have gone very well. He further said 17 loss-making PSUs were cleared for privatisation, but their progress has been slow. Notably, the government has planned to raise â‚¹72,500 crore through stake sale in public sector units in the current fiscal.
