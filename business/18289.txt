BlackBerry, in line with last week's warning, reported a loss of $965-million for the second-quarter ended August, bringing down the company's revenue by 45% to $1.6-million. The adjusted loss was $248-million or $0.47/share this quarter, far below the loss of $0.16/share projected by FactSet. Reportedly, Fairfax Financial proposed buying BlackBerry for $9/share, almost a dollar more than its current value.
