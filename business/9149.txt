The RBI on Thursday directed banks to publish photographs of only those who have been declared as wilful defaulters. The directive comes after the central bank noticed that some banks were indiscriminately publishing photographs of defaulters in newspapers. The RBI has also asked banks to formulate a policy to set out the criteria for publication of defaulters' photos.
