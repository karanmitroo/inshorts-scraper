A painting by 20th-century Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky has been sold for a record £33 million (₹271 crore). The 1913 "Bild mit weissen Linien" (Painting with white lines) was bought for a UK-based client after a 13-minutes bidding war. Wassily's record was broken twice, with another of his paintings selling for £21 million (₹172 crore), minutes apart in the auction.
