The government has clarified that the food served to patients admitted to the hospital is part of healthcare services and is therefore exempt from GST. However, the food served by the hospital to patients who are not admitted will be taxable. Also, there will be no GST levied on services provided by doctors, consultants, and technicians at the hospital.
