The GST Council on Saturday cleared the pending rules, including transition provisions and returns, with all the states agreeing to roll out GST from July 1. This comes after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said her state won't roll out the regime in its present form. The Council has fitted over 1,200 goods and 500 services in four tax brackets.
