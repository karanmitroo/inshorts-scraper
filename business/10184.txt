The Royal Bank of Scotland has cancelled a contract with Infosys, following which the IT firm stated, it will "ramp-down" 3,000 employees. The cancellation, which will reportedly impact $40-50 million of Infosys' revenue this year, came after RBS abandoned the floating of a separate bank Williams & Glyn. The RBS had awarded a five-year contract to Infosys for W&G.
