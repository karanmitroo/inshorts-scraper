Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has termed the retrospective taxation regime a “legacy issue” and assured US investors that the government is not planning to legislate retrospectively. "We do not intend that any fresh action under the old retrospective laws be taken. So for the future, this is a closed issue,” Jaitley said.
