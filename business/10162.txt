UK-based PricewaterhouseCoopers is being sued for $5.5 billion, the biggest case filed against an auditing firm, after it failed to identify a fraud that resulted in a bank collapse during the global financial crisis. The case was filed by defunct mortgage underwriter Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, alleging PwC of certifying more than $1 billion of Alabama-based Colonial Bank's non-existent assets.
