Jet Airways reported a net loss of $329 million, in the year ending March 2015, half of what it was last year. The airline has reportedly not made profits since 2007 due to competition and high operating costs in India. Indiaâ€™s second-biggest carrier by market, Jet has now announced a cost-cutting plan as it eyes a full-year profit in 2017.
