Chinese education firm Hailiang Education Group became the world's most valuable company for eight minutes after a trading error caused its stock price to jump 20,000-fold. Bids for the company's stock were received at $200,000 (â‚¹1.28 crore), pushing its market capitalisation to $5.14 trillion, six times Apple's valuation. After 700 shares were traded at the high price, trading was halted.
