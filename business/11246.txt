Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma today said the Centre has started the process to disinvest its stake and privatise 14 out of 16 hotels run by the India Tourism Development Corporation. The move is aimed at improving the state-owned firm's financial health. The Ashoka and Samrat hotels will be the only ones that would be run by ITDC now, Sharma added.
