State Bank of India (SBI) is reportedly set to launch a mobile wallet called ‘Batua’ for feature phones (phones offering internet access but lacking the advanced functionalities of a smartphone) next month. SBI also plans to launch a version of Batua for very basic phones, which can be used without internet facilities and app installation.
