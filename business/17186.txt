Facebook is acquiring video advertising company LiveRail in its latest step to make video ads a bigger part of its business. Facebook didn’t disclose a price for the San Francisco-based company, founded in 2007. LiveRail’s technology automatically pairs video ads with the videos that appear on many websites, such as the sites for Major League Baseball, ABC and A&E Networks.
