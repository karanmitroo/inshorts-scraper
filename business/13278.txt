Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has tied-up with Russia's Rostech State Corporation to manufacture at least 200 Kamov 226T light helicopters. With an estimated worth of $1 billion, this is the first Indo-Russian high-tech project under the 'Make in India' initiative. The Russian Kamovs would replace the ageing fleet of India's Chetak and Cheetah helicopters.
