Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday met the heads of the public sector banks to discuss their key challenges including the growing non-performing assets (NPAs) issue. The banks' cumulative losses of ₹18,000 crore during the previous fiscal was due to higher provisioning for bad loans, Jaitley said, adding, the government had earmarked ₹25,000 crore for recapitalisation of the banks.
