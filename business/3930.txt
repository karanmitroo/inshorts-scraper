Software giant Microsoft, on Thursday, confirmed that it would cut up to 4,000 jobs in its sales and marketing department. The company further added that the job cuts would mostly be outside the US. A Microsoft spokesperson said in an email last week that the company is implementing the changes to better serve its customers and partners.
