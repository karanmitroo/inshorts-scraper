Various banks have written to Vijay Mallya's legal counsel rejecting his proposal to repay ₹4,000 crore of nearly ₹9,000 crore that the defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes the lenders. Reportedly, the banks are expecting a ₹7,500 crore payment including a principal of ₹5,000 crore and an interest of ₹2,500 crore. A court hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 7.
