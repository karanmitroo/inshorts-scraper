The GST rate on processed foods should be lower or at zero level as India cannot afford high taxes with food inflation rising over 6%, the Confederation of Indian Industry said on Wednesday. The CII recommended processed food products' rate be kept in three slabs, accounting for different income groups' consumers. The Parliament cleared the GST Bill earlier this month.
