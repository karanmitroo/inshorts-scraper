Ratan Tata had personally asked Cyrus Mistry to resign as Tata Sons Chairman as the board lost faith in him, but his refusal led to the removal through majority vote. Before the October 24 meeting, Mistry was offered an opportunity to resign voluntarily, Tata Sons said. Mistry was removed after "little or no signs of improvement" in leadership, it added.
