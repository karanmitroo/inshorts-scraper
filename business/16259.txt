Coal India is transporting extra volumes of coal ahead of a five-day worker union strike. The company has been transporting coal in 225 trains over the past few days instead of 207 per day to cover for the loss from the strike. The workers will go on a strike from Tuesday to protest government's moves towards commercial mining of coal.
