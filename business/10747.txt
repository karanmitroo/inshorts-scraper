The apparel industry is expected to see investments worth ₹5,000 crore during 2016, which could create nearly two million new jobs, the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) has said. The government's target of generating 10 million jobs, and $30 billion from exports by 2020 is "very...doable", AEPC added. The Cabinet had earlier cleared a ₹6,000-crore outlay for the textiles sector.
