Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that government is considering to retain Air India's national carrier status while privatising it. This is likely to increase its valuation as national carriers get preference while signing bilateral flying contracts. Jaitley further said it is no longer feasible to use taxpayer money to fund an airline with just 15-16% of domestic market share.
