Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos has accused the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of delaying the disbursement of more aid to the country under the â‚¬86 billion ($93 billion) bailout approved seven months ago. The IMF is passing for extra fiscal cuts to ensure Greece reaches a 3.5% budget surplus excluding interest payments in 2018, he added.
