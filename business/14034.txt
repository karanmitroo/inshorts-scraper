The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Delhi Government to probe into a complaint alleging that food delivery company Food Panda imposed inflated Value Added Tax on some of its customers. The petitioners' lawyer told the court that instead of calculating the VAT as a percentage of sub-total, it was determined on both the sub-total and service tax.
