The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is axing 158 branches, most of them NatWest outlets, with the loss of up to 362 jobs. The group blamed the move on customers turning away from traditional counter service to do banking on the internet and mobile phones. â€œAs customers change the way they bank...we must change the way we serve," RBS said.
