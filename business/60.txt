A special money laundering court in Mumbai on Saturday issued non-bailable warrants against fraud-accused jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi over the $2-billion PNB fraud. This comes after the Enforcement Directorate had moved the court seeking non-bailable warrants against the duo. Earlier, Nirav Modi has refused to join CBI investigation citing his "businesses abroad" as the reason.
