Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Nokia plant in Tamil Nadu was left like an "orphaned child" and the government was "on the job" to make it operational. The factory was left out of the $7.2-billion deal signed between Microsoft and Nokia in 2014. Nokia had provided jobs to 8,000 people when the plant was functioning at full capacity.
