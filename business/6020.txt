The Unique Identification Authority of India has filed a criminal complaint against Axis Bank and two other firms for allegedly storing Aadhaar biometrics and using them in an unauthorised manner. The breach was detected after UIDAI found 397 transactions done with the same fingerprint. This would not have been possible without core biometrics being used without authorisation, an official said.
