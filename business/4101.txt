Vijay Mallya never intended to repay the loans he took for Kingfisher Airlines, the CBI claimed in its supplementary charge sheet, which it filed against the liquor baron and others earlier this month. CBI alleged that Kingfisher Airlines misled banks and obtained loans with the intention of cheating. Notably, Mallya owes over ₹9,000 crore to banks.
