The Companies Bill 2013 has received President's assent, which will make it into a law replacing the nearly six-decade old Companies Act 1956 that govern corporates in the country. The new bill requires companies to spend on social welfare, empowers investors against any frauds, encourages companies to have women directors, and seeks to bring in greater transparency in corporate governance.
