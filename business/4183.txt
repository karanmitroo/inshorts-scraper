Public sector banks cannot be held responsible in case of theft of valuables from lockers, according to an RTI response by RBI. Banks have contended that the relationship they have with customers with regard to lockers is that of a lessee (landlord) and lessor (tenant), in which lessors are responsible for their valuables kept in lockers owned by banks.
