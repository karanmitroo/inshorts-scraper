Indian IT giants have ganged up to keep freshers' salaries low, taking advantage of the oversupply of software engineers at entry level, former Infosys board member Mohandas Pai said. "Companies must increase freshers' salaries and reduce top people's compensation," he added. Reports suggest salaries of freshers have increased from ₹2.25 lakh to only ₹3.5 lakh per annum in 20 years.
