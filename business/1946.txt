Furniture major IKEA has been slammed for an advertisement in China featuring a mother scolding her daughter saying, "If you don't bring home a boyfriend next time, then don't call me Mom!" IKEA has withdrawn the advertisement following accusations that the ad was "sexist" and insensitive towards single women. The company apologised for "giving the wrong perception" in the advertisement.
