The Bank of England has increased interest rates for the first time since 2007 in order to curb high inflation. The base rate has been lifted from 0.25% to 0.5%. Adding that interest rates are expected to rise over the next three years, the bank warned that Brexit has a "noticeable impact on the economic outlook".
