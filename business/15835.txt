RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has rejected the idea of inheritance tax - a levy paid by a person who inherits money or property of a person who has died. "I would argue rather than a blanket inheritance tax, let's change the culture. Make it such that people don't want to leave a lot of wealth for their children,” he said.
