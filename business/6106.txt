US food company Kraft Heinz has withdrawn its proposal for a $143 billion (â‚¹9.6 lakh crore) merger with rival Unilever, the companies said. Kraft had made a surprise offer in an attempt to build a global consumer goods giant that was rejected by Unilever, the maker of Dove soap. Notably, the deal would've been the third biggest takeover in history.
