President Ram Nath Kovind has promulgated an ordinance enabling an increase in the GST cess on medium-sized cars, large cars, and SUVs, from 15% to up to 25%. However, the increase in cess will be effective only after the GST Council notifies it. The quantum of cess hike in each variety of car would also be decided by the Council.
