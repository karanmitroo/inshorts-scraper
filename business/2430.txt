The Supreme Court said it will appoint a court commissioner as receiver of Unitech's properties to realise ₹7,600 crore to be paid to homebuyers if they opt for a refund. Unitech promoter Sanjay Chandra urged the court to grant him interim bail so he can assist the refund process. Notably, Unitech owes ₹7,816 crore to 16,300 homebuyers in 61 projects.
