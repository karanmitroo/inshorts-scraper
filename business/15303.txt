Hyundai Motors has become the first car-maker to install a Google Android Auto system in its Sonata Sedan, sold in the US. The users will now be able to plug their phones and access the navigation, messages and calls on their car's eight-inch touchscreen. Phone-screens will be locked while driving to prevent distraction. Hyundai has promised an Apple version soon.
