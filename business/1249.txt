India's largest telecom firm Airtel's Chairman Sunil Mittal has said that his move to invest in Africa in 2010 "was a bit rushed". Mittal said that it took 6-7 years of his personal time and resources to fix the issue. Notably, Airtel had ventured in the African market with $10.7 billion acquisition of Kuwait-based Zain Telecom's African assets.
