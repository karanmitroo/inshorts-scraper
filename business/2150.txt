Fast food chain Pizza Hut has developed a limited-edition jacket called 'Pizza Parka' using the lining material on its delivery pouches. According to Pizza Hut, the parka has pizza-inspired features including triple-layer insulation and an interior pizza pocket. Customers who order a pizza via its website or app will get a chance to have Pizza Parka delivered with their pizza.
