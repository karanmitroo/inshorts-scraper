Food conglomerate Nestlé was sued on Thursday by arcade games company Atari in a copyright and trademark infringement suit, for copying its 40-year-old video game 'Breakout' in a KitKat advertisement. Atari accused Nestlé of using Breakout's look and feel. In the advertisement titled "Kit Kat: Breakout", Nestlé "took the classic Breakout screen, replaced its bricks with KitKat bars," Atari said.
