A consortium of 17 banks filed a contempt application in the Karnataka High Court on Wednesday against liquor baron Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines and UBHL. They have alleged the violation of an undertaking given to the Debt Recovery Tribunal that they would not alienate unencumbered assets nor deal with them. The banks collectively lent Rs 7,000 crore to the airline.
