The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has approved Air India's flight route over the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco, to save time and fuel. Notably, the new route will be 1,400 kilometres longer than the current trajectory, but will be economical because of eastward tailwinds. Air India is reportedly the first Indian carrier to operate on the Pacific route.
