Telecom regulator TRAI has proposed uniform inter-connection guidelines for transmission of TV channels across all available platforms like cable, DTH, and IPTV to bring in more transparency in the broadcasting business. Currently, two regulatory frameworks are applicable for inter-connection of IPTV, DTH, and cable TV services. This would result in better services at affordable prices, TRAI said.
