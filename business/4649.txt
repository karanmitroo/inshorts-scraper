Reliance Jio said the government suffered a revenue shortfall of â‚¹400 crore in FY17 because Airtel, Vodafone and Idea violated licence norms. Jio claimed these firms paid advance licence fee for the last quarter, which was less than the stipulated amount. Jio added the Telecom Department should take action against violating telcos, which includes financial penalties and even licence revocation.
