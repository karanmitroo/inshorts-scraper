After a clearance from RBI, Tatas have become the first in the country to open white-label ATMs (ATMs which arenâ€™t owned and operated by any bank). A total of 15,000 such ATMs will be installed in next 3-years, two-third of which will be in smaller towns. White-label ATMs account for nearly 50% of ATMs in US and 70% in Canada.
