Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has said that Bitcoin is not a permanent feature of our lives. Shiller said Bitcoin is a "really clever idea" but raised concerns over it going viral as a currency. He further said, "We are over-emphasising Bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications."
