Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi has said that he has businesses abroad and cannot come to India for CBI's investigation into the alleged $2-billion PNB fraud case against him. Asking him to contact the nearest Indian embassy, the CBI offered to make arrangements for his return. The CBI has also made it "mandatory" for Nirav to join the investigation next week.
