Reliance Communications' (RCom) enterprise arm Global Cloud Xchange has sent a 'Cease & Desist' notice to its rivals to stop campaigns implying that the company is closing down voice services for business clients. RCom termed the campaign as "illegal" and "malicious". Earlier, RCom had announced that it is closing down voice services for retail subscribers on its networks.
