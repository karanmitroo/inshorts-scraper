Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday announced reform plans aimed at reducing the economy's dependence on crude oil exports. He said that this would transform Saudi Arabia into a global investment power. He added that a green card system will be launched in five years to allow expatriates to live and work long-term in the country.
