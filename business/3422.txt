UK roadside repair firm AA on Tuesday lost over £200 million (nearly ₹1,690 crore) or nearly a fifth of its value. This came after shares fell as much as 18% during the day after it fired its Executive Chairman Bob Mackenzie with immediate effect for 'gross misconduct'. However, his son said he resigned over an 'extremely distressing mental health issue'.
