Led by an increase in thermal power generation, the power supply in India grew 10.76% for Apr-Nov, the highest growth rate in the past 5 years. Power generation grew 10.21% in Nov, owing to the base effect since power production grew 6.31% in Nov 2013. Power supply rose also because India added nearly 10k MW capacity between April and October.
