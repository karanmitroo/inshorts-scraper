Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Thursday announced plans to bring Teavana, their own speciality tea brand, to its stores across India. Starbucks sticks to a standard retail model, but also balances it with local requirements, CEO Schultz added. Under its joint venture with Tata Global Beverages, Starbucks currently operates 75 outlets across seven cities in India.
