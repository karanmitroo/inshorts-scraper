Renowned TV journalist Arnab Goswami has said that plain vanilla content is boring, and that opinion is the future of journalism. “I can’t simply be a Wikipedia of facts and...tell you what happened. Plain vanilla journalism is dead...overdone, overused, and...boring,” he noted. Goswami further added that opinionated media has the potential to be an activist and an agent of change.
