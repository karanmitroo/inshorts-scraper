The World Bank cut the global growth forecast to 2.9% for 2016, from the previously forecasted 3.3%. "The global economy will need to adapt to... modest growth in large emerging markets, characterized by lower commodity prices and diminished flows of trade and capital", the bank said. The lender also slashed its outlook for China, Brazil and Russia.
