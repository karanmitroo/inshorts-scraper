Tata Group is planning to expand its financial services and consumer businesses, and sell or merge dozens of smaller units, according to reports. Tata is hiring a number of bankers to refocus on the group's biggest businesses, reports added. Around one-third of the Tata Group's 100-plus units could go as the group is trying to prune unprofitable businesses.
