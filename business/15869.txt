Citigroup Inc cut Chief Executive Michael Corbat's pay by about 7% in 2014, a year in which profit of the bank nearly halved due to higher legal costs and a slump in bond trading. Corbat earned an estimated $13.1 million for the year, including deferred shares worth about $3.49 million. He had earned an estimated $14.1 million in 2013.
