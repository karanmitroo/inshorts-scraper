The government has undertaken a â‚¹1,038 crore scheme in the North-East region for developing and modernising the textile sector in the eight states, to boost exports, increase jobs and curb the migration of workers. The project, which presently aims at setting up ready-made garment manufacturing units, intends to cover other aspects like sericulture, handlooms and handicrafts in the future.
