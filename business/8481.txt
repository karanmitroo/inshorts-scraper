India's rank improved by 21 spots to 87th out of 144 countries on the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2016. The rise was driven by improvements in the education sector, where India managed to close its gap entirely in primary and secondary education, the report said. Iceland topped the latest rankings followed by Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
