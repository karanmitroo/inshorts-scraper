Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank on Friday said that it will not settle to pay the $14 billion fine demanded by the US for malpractices leading to the 2008 financial crisis. â€œDeutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. The negotiations are only just beginning," the bank said in a statement.
