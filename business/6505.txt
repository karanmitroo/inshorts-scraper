BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has sought an investigation into the funding of journalist Arnab Goswami’s news channel 'Republic TV'. “Two money flows require investigation. First, from Singapore in $. Second from an Assam politician in rupees," he tweeted. This comes after Arnab changed the channel’s name from 'Republic' to 'Republic TV' as Swamy raised an objection to the word 'Republic'.
