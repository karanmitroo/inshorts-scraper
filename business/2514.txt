Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a way for startups to raise money from investors, similar to crowdfunding, by selling custom tokens. The token or digital currency is issued in exchange for legal tender or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The value of the token appreciates or depreciates depending on the issuing company's performance.
