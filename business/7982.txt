The stocks of Israel-based builder of sensor-laden border fences and walls, Magal Security Systems, rose 6% on Monday, capping a 19% advance since Donald Trump’s victory in US elections. Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border may have caused the rise, CEO Saar Koursh said. Magal had also built an anti-terrorist fence along the Gaza Strip.
