India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday warned farmers in the northern and western states that heavy rainfall and hail during March 11-15 could hit Rabi crops like wheat and mustard. IMD advised farmers to harvest matured crops and use hail nets for protection. Last year, bad weather had destroyed 10 million hectares of crops in nearly 150 districts across India.
