After the 40-year long ban on United States' oil export was lifted, the first oil tanker, named "Theo T", carrying a cargo of oil departed from a port in Texas on Thursday to Italy. A budget deal between the US President Barack Obama and the Congress revoked the ban, which was imposed in the 1970s following the Arab Oil Embargo.
