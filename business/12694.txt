The Indian Railways is reportedly considering the possibility of effecting a 5-10% increase in the passenger fares in the coming budget. This comes against the backdrop of an additional burden of ₹32,000 crore on Railways towards implementing the 7th pay commission recommendations. Further, the Finance Ministry has recently slashed its budgetary support to Railways for 2015-16 by ₹8,000 crore.
