After Cyrus Mistry criticised his removal as Tata Chairman in a letter, the Tata Group has termed the move as a 'political drama' and 'emotional outburst'. His removal was not illegal and was done "as per the articles of Association", Tata stated. In the letter, Mistry said he was made a 'lame duck' chairman, and was 'shocked' by his removal.
