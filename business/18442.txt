India's largest steel-maker, Tata Steel is keen to grab the Indian iron-ore assets of one of Britain's largest steel trading companies - Stemcor, which is in trouble after defaulting on more than $1-billion of loans. Stemcor's recovery plan proposes offloading its Orissa mines, which can fetch an estimated $800-million. However, Tata faces stiff competition from Jindal Steel and Power.
