The National Health Protection Scheme, dubbed 'Modicare', that aims to provide ₹5 lakh annual cover per family to 10 crore poor families, will be implemented from October 2. Announcing the 2018 Budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had termed the plan as "the world's largest government-funded healthcare programme". The initiative will reportedly require ₹11,000 crore in state and central funding.
