Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said that the government is ready to develop a 'dry port' in Pune, Maharashtra. This would be connected to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port near Mumbai via a rail link which would reduce both logistical cost and pollution, he added. Dry ports are already being developed in Maharashtra's Nagpur, Wardha, Aurangabad, and Jalna, Gadkari informed.
