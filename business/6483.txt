Bharti Airtel has said that although it welcomes the proposed alliance of Vodafone and Idea, it's important to ensure that such consolidations are not an outcome of forced situations. Such consolidations shouldn't come by offering ‘unfair playing field’ to a particular company while destroying others, it said. Earlier, Airtel complained against permitting Reliance Jio to continue its free offer.
