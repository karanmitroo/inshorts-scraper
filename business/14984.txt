To facilitate taxpayers through e-enabled services, the Income-Tax department has started the process of online verification of Income Tax Returns, the finance ministry said on Tuesday. The move will also end the practice of sending paper acknowledgement to its office in Bengaluru. A taxpayer will now be able to verify return through Internet banking or through Aadhar-based authentication process.
