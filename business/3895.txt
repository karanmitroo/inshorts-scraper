Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that GST was ‘goodbye to simple tax’ and not a ‘good and simple tax’, as described by the PM. He further stressed that the new tax regime was good for the government and bad for the common man. Sibal claimed “a multilateral GST was for the rich, by the rich, and of the rich”.
