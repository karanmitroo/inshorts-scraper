Australian Senate has revealed that the country's mail chief Ahmed Fahour is the nation's highest paid public servant and was paid a salary of $4.3 million (â‚¹28.8 crore) last year, which is more than 10 times the salary of the country's PM. The disclosure came despite Australian Post's objections that making salary information public could damage its brand.
