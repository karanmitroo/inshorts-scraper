State-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) on Tuesday said it has become the largest mobiliser under the government's Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) launched in November last year. The bank gained substantial gold deposits after the Tirupati temple deposited 1,311 kg of gold with it, PNB said. GMS allows banks to collect gold as deposits and offer interest on it.
