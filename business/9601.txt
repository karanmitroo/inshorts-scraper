Bharti Airtel on Friday asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to find a way to curb the “massive asymmetric traffic” and ensure that receiving networks are not “abused by (a) tsunami of free traffic”. Further, incumbents told TRAI that free voice calls offered by Reliance Jio violated its regulations, which state that tariffs should be non-predatory and non-discriminatory.
