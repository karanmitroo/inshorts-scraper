Nearly nine lakh chemists across the country have gone on a strike today, to protest against the strict rules on the sale of medicines in India and against online pharmacies. Though all medical stores will remain shut for a day, emergency pharmacies in and around hospitals will remain open. A demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi is also likely.
