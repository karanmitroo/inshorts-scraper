Japan on Friday warned China against frequent manipulation of yuan rates following China devaluing the yuan by nearly two percent, last week. "Japan would face a tough decision on how to respond if China intervenes frequently in the market," Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. He also urged China to continue shifting its currency market to a market-oriented system.
