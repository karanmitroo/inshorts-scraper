State-owned natural gas producer GAIL on Wednesday reported a 51% year-on-year rise in net profit to ₹770 crore for the quarter ended March. However, turnover for the quarter fell 22% to ₹11,627 crore owing to lower petrochemical and LPG prices, it said. The jump in profit was attributed to a rise in natural gas sales and transmission volumes.
