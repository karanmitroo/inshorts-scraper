India’s largest steelmaker Tata Steel's consolidated net loss widened over 10-fold to ₹3,183 crore in the quarter ended June, against a ₹317 crore loss in the year-ago period. The company's revenue also fell 5.7% year-on-year to ₹26,406.10 crore. The loss was attributed to a global supply glut that pressured prices and discontinued operations of the company's UK business.
