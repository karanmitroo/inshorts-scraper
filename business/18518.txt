To reduce operating costs, GoAir has decided to recruit only airhostesses which will lighten the aircrafts and save fuel, since males are heavier compared to females. Every additional kg on board costs Rs 3 per flight-hour.  With the falling rupee, Go expects to save about Rs 2.5-3-crore annually, as an airhostess weighs about 15-20-kg less than a male flight attendant.
