The US dollar held near a 14-year high against a basket of global currencies on Tuesday following speculation of stronger inflation in the US amid expectations of expansionary fiscal polices under President-elect Donald Trump. The rupee was trading at its lowest value in nearly 5 months. Earlier on Monday, the dollar rose to a nine-month high.
