Billionaire Warren Buffett's decision to take stakes in the four largest US airlines could be the first step to eventually taking over one of the companies, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. "We view a full-scale acquisition of an airline by Berkshire as a possibility," they said. Buffett jumped into airline stocks in 2016 after dumping 90% of his Walmart shares.
