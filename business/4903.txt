Kris Gopalakrishnan, Co-founder and former Infosys CEO, said even though he is no longer professionally engaged with the company, the emotional connect will never go away. "Infosys' best interest will always be in my mind," he said. "You cannot emotionally walk away from something...you have built over your lifetime, or most of your lifetime...33 or 35 years," he added.
