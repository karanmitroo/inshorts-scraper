Greek PM Alexis Tsipras on Friday forecasted a 'happy ending' to negotiations with creditors on a cash-for-reform deal. The chairman of Euro Zone finance ministers also said talks were making progress, though not enough for a deal next Monday. The country continues to face a severe cash crunch with no progress in talks with the International Monetary Fund.
