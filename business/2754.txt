Four senior executives of British consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser are quitting amid the company attempting to recover from its weakest performance. The maker of Durex condoms and Dettol products confirmed the departures of the heads of HR, IT, marketing, and developing markets. The voluntary departures also come after Reckitt acquired Mead Johnson in its biggest takeover ever.
