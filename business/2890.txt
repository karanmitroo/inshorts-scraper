Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday said the government has imposed stock limits on sugar mills for the next two months to keep prices under control. The stock limits have been imposed to prevent artificial hoarding of sugar by mills during the festival season. The government last month had increased import duty on sugar to 50%, up from 40%.
