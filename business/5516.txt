Consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble has moved Delhi High Court in an appeal against an order dismissing its plea over alleged disparaging shampoo advertisements by Hindustan Unilever. The brands in question are HUL's Clinic Plus shampoo and P&G's Head & Shoulders shampoo. Earlier, both firms filed suits against each other, claiming that the other's ads were undermining its brand.
