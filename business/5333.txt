Vijay Mallya has filed an appeal in the Securities Appellate Tribunal against a SEBI order which barred him from the securities market for alleged violations of listing agreement, diversion of funds and fraud. When the SEBI order was passed, Mallya took to social media to call it a "witch hunt". Notably, SEBI had barred six other officials from United Spirits.
