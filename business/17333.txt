Claiming that the approvals granted to AirAsia were ‘illegal’, the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA) has asked the government to advise the DGCA not to allow the new no-frill airline to launch its operations, which is set for June 12.  The letter to the govt was sent on Friday when the airline announced the launch of its maiden flight.
