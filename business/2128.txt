Vanuatu, a South Pacific archipelago, has become the first nation to accept Bitcoins as payment for its 'investment citizenship' program. A family of up to four can receive Vanuatu passports by paying the Bitcoin equivalent of $280,000 (â‚¹1.8 crore). Vanuatu citizenship allows individuals to reside on the island, and travel to over 100 countries without a visa.
