State-run Steel Authority of India will spend ₹4,000 crore this year for increasing its capacity by about 43% to 21.4 million metric tons by 2018, its Chairman said. This is a part of a long-term goal of achieving 50 million tons in the next decade. Steel demand will "boom", he said, adding, "Unless we create this capacity, we’d be short-sighted."
