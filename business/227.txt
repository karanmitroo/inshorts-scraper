Taiwan police have arrested four men over a â‚¹1.1-crore Bitcoin robbery, describing it as "first domestic case of Bitcoin robbery". Police said the suspects communicated online with a man surnamed Tai to purchase Bitcoins, sending photographs of cash to convince him. After Tai showed his Bitcoins on his phone, they assaulted him and transferred 18 Bitcoins to an unspecified account.
