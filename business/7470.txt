Former Tata Chairman Cyrus Mistry on Monday in a letter to company shareholders said that Tata Group was nobody's personal fiefdom. The group belongs to all shareholders, not just Tata trustees, he stated. "I have been sacked for no reason, what I've done for the benefit of the company, individual is irrelevant in the larger scheme of things," he added.
