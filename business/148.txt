Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao has said that Indian telecom regulator TRAI's new rule on predatory pricing is "not fair". He said that Vodafone has lost 80% of India business due to the data pricing war fuelled by a new competitor in the market. "It sounds like you have to fight somebody with hands tied at the back," he added.
