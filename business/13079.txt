India's trade deficit with China widened to an unprecedented $45 billion in 2015, trade data released on Wednesday revealed. The bilateral trade between the two nations failed to reach the $100 billion target, reaching $71.63 billion in 2015. China became India's largest trading partner in 2011, but the growing trade deficit has been a cause of concern for India.
