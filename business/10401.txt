The government has withdrawn the nearly $2 billion tender for procuring six mid-air refuellers for the Indian Air Force from European defence and aerospace major Airbus. The cancellation was reportedly due to high life-cycle cost and it may instead go for a government-to-government deal. An earlier tender for procuring these aircraft was scrapped in 2010.
