Raymond Chairman Gautam Singhania has said, "I have to keep Raymond firewalled from my internal family politics." "I wear two hats. One is a family hat, and one is chairman and managing director of Raymond. I cannot mix them," he added. Notably, Gautam is in the middle of a dispute with his father Vijaypat Singhania, who claimed he's struggling financially.
