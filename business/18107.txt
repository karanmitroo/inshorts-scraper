Oil Minister Veerappa Moily at the KPMG energy conclave on Wednesday said the country would free up the diesel price for market forces in six months and lift the state-fixed discounted rates with gradual price increases. "If rupee appreciates against the dollar and international oil prices drop, we will be in a position to completely deregulate diesel," Moily said.
