In its first meeting post-Brexit, the European Union on Wednesday said that "any country" wishing to access its single market will have to accept "four freedoms", which include free movement of labour, goods, services and capital. The EU also called on Britain to trigger the exit clause, which would start a two-year clock to negotiate its exit from the union.
