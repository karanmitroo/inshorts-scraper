Iran's state-run airline IranAir on Sunday said that it had finalised a $16.6 billion (over â‚¹1.1 lakh crore) deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes. This is Iran's biggest deal with a US-based company since the 1979 Islamic revolution. This comes after decades-long economic sanctions against Iran were lifted following a deal to restrict its nuclear program.
