The RBI has told the Delhi High Court it wants to take a fresh look into the $1.18 billion arbitral award granted to NTT DoCoMo for Tata Sons' alleged breach of agreement. The court, however, didn't agree with RBI, saying there was no point in going over it again. It further said, "In every private award, RBI cannot step in."
