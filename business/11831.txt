A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Monday issued a non-bailable warrant against liquor baron Vijay Mallya in connection with the plea by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Further, the court also rejected Kingfisher Airlines' plea challenging the ED's claim that ₹430 crore of the ₹950 crore loan from IDBI was diverted by Mallya for acquiring properties abroad.
