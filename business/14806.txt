AirAsia India and Vistara, the country's most recently launched carriers, are looking to double the number of weekly flights during the winter schedule starting in October. The airlines have sought the DGCA's permission to operate 739 flights a week during the six-month winter schedule. The DGCA has reportedly called a meeting of all airlines to discuss their requests.
