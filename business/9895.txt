Banks today told the Supreme Court that beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya "deliberately" didn’t make full disclosure of his assets including the $40 million he received in February. Further, Mallya was accused of complete breach of SC's directions. The court was hearing a petition filed by SBI, who is leading a 17-bank consortium for recovering ₹9,000 crore from the Kingfisher Airlines.
