The White House has defended President Donald Trump's criticism of Nordstrom retail chain, saying that the firm's decision to drop his daughter Ivanka's fashion line was a politically motivated attack. Although Nordstrom said the decision was based on the brand's performance, a White House spokesperson said there had been "a direct attack" on Trump's policies and Ivanka's name.
