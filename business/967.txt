BBC China editor Carrie Gracie has resigned due to the corporation's "secretive and illegal pay culture" and the "indefensible pay gap".  She said the corporation was "breaking equality law" in how it paid female staff. BBC faced an "exodus of female talent" after it was revealed last year that two-thirds of its top-earning staff were men, she added.
