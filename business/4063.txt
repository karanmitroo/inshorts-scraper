Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a decree extending the embargo imposed on food products from the EU and other Western countries until the end of 2018. The move comes days after the European Union formally rolled out fresh economic sanctions against Russia. Earlier, Putin had said that the embargo would end once the sanctions are lifted.
