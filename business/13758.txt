Uber signed a multi-year contract with Dutch navigation company TomTom to get digital maps and traffic data for its driver-used software. "What they (Uber) get from us is total control of their application," TomTom's CEO said. TomTom provides raw data and databases along with technology to run them so Uber doesn't need to "share sensitive information with other companies."
