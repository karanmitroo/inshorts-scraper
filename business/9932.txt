The government on Friday decided to extend export duty benefits to onions amid attempts to check a 'steep' fall in prices and protect farmer interests. The Commerce and Industry Ministry will provide 5% benefits under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme until December 31. Wholesale prices at Asia's biggest onion market in Maharashtra slumped 87.6% from the year-ago period to â‚¹6/kg.
