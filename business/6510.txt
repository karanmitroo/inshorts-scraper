The Service Tax Department will auction Vijay Mallya-led now defunct Kingfisher Airlines’ corporate jet in March to recover dues worth ₹535 crore. The dues are in regard to Mallya collecting money as service tax from flyers on behalf of the government. However, the same was not deposited in government treasury. Notably, Mallya's group company owes ₹9,000 crore to 17 banks.
