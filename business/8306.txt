India's petroleum dealers will go on a full-fledged strike on November 15 to protest against their declining margins, All India Petroleum Dealers Association said. “We have been saying to increase the dealers’ commission to 5% from the existing rate of 3%,” it said. Further, dealers will not make purchases from oil companies on November 3 but continue to sell fuel.
