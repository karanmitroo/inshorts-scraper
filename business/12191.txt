The 200-year old Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai has said that it will deposit 44 kg of its total stock of 160 kg of gold under the government's gold monetisation scheme (GMS). In this regard, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Friday said that temple trusts across India have also shown interest in depositing gold under the scheme.
