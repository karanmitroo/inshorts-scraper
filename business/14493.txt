With the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy for the current fiscal due on September 29th, Finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday that "Common sense says the rates should come down". He added that the current inflation is "very much under control" and said that the country could grow at more than 7-7.5% if the interest rates are lowered.
