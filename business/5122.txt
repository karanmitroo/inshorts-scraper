Hindustan Unilever, maker of Kwality Wall's frozen desserts, has come out with a new ad stressing the use of milk in its products. The ad is in response to a campaign by GCMMF, which owns ice-cream brand Amul, that claimed frozen desserts contain vanaspati. HUL has already sued Amul for the campaign, saying it is "disparaging" towards frozen desserts.
