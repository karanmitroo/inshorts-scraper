Former Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu on Sunday said that the country's GDP growth should have been back at over 9% owing to low crude oil prices. "It had reached a rate of 9.5% from 2005 to 2008...This massive slowdown needs to be properly diagnosed," he tweeted. Notably, India's GDP growth stood at 6.3% in the July-September quarter.
