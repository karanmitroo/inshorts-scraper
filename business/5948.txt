Biocon Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has called for establishing a standard setting regulatory body for medical devices, as non-certified devices put patients at serious risk. "I certainly think we need to have a standard setting regulatory body," she stated. "Precision of any medical intervention is critical as we cannot afford to have non-certified medical devices in the market," she added.
