Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka has said President-elect Donald Trump is himself an entrepreneur, business-friendly and innovation-oriented, and so he expects Trump's policies to be friendly towards business, innovation and entrepreneurship. Sikka further said Infosys is not "overly concerned" about potential restrictions on sending its employees to the US, as it is increasingly hiring more local people.
