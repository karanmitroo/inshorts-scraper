General Motors (GM) has asked US safety regulators for a one-year delay in the mandatory recall of almost a million vehicles with Takata airbags. GM has reasoned that the designated models have not been found to carry risks linked to deaths and injuries. However, earlier, drivers have reportedly been killed by shrapnel in instances of Takata airbags exploding with force.
