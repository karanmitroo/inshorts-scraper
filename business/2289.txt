Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that Goods and Services Tax (GST) slabs may be reduced in the future if a "revenue neutral plus" tax level is reached. "We have almost by the day, space and scope for improvement," Jaitley added. The government always endeavours to bring down tax rates on mass consumption commodities, he added.
