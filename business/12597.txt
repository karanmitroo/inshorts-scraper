Japan's economy has shrunk an annualized 1.4% in the quarter ended December, following a revised 1.3% gain in the previous quarter, the Japanese government said. The contraction was attributed to weakness in private consumption, despite the government's efforts to push inflation and growth in the country. Notably, Japan's central bank has adopted negative interest rates last month.
