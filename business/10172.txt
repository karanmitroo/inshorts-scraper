The government today decreased the petrol price by ₹1/litre and lowered the diesel price by ₹2/litre, effective midnight. Petrol in Delhi will now cost ₹60.09/litre, while diesel will cost ₹50.27/litre. "The current level of international product prices of petrol and diesel, and the exchange rate (rupee-US dollar)" warrant a change in prices, the Indian Oil Corporation said.
