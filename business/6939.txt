China has reportedly threatened some of South Korea's largest companies including Samsung over the country's decision to deploy US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system for protection against North Korean nuclear threats. China also called on South Korea to halt deployment of THAAD as it "disrupts regional strategic balance" and undermines China's "security interest".
