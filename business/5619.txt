Public sector banks have been able to recover only ₹155 crore from Vijay Mallya, which is less than 2% of more than ₹8,000 crore outstanding loan against him. The ₹155 crore was recovered by the banks through auctioning the seized properties of Mallya. He is currently living in the UK, evading arrest in cases related to loan defaults in India.
