IT industry body Nasscom has come out in defence of its members TCS and Infosys, saying the two accounted for only 7,504 (8.8%) of the approved H-1B visas in 2014-15. The statement comes after US President Donald Trump's administration accused the two of unfairly applying for large numbers of H-1B visas by putting extra tickets in the current lottery system.
