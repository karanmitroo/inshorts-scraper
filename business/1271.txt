Foreign workers in the US may work for more than one employer on an H1-B work visa, the country's immigration agency said. "New employer must submit an I-129 petition before you begin working," it added. Form I-129 is submitted for a non-immigrant worker to the agency and used by employers and prospective employers to obtain workers on non-immigrant visa status.
