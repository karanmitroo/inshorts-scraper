Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras has agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to settle a US lawsuit brought by investors who claimed its corruption scandal hit the value of their investments. Petrobras, however, denied any wrongdoing under the deal. Petrobras was sued after Brazilian prosecutors accused the company's former executives of accepting over $2 billion in bribes over a decade.
