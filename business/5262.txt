Shares of United Continental Holdings fell by over 3.7% during intraday trade on Tuesday, wiping nearly $800 million (over â‚¹5,100 crore) off the company's market value. The plunge came after a video of police officers dragging a passenger from an overbooked United Airlines flight sparked social media backlash. Later, United's CEO defended his employees, saying they followed proper procedures.
