Zimbabwe's Treasury officials revealed that the country's banks currently face cash shortages after they stopped importing foreign currencies. Fewer people are reportedly depositing savings and banking institutions are limiting ATM withdrawals, the officials said. Since 2009, Zimbabwe has abandoned its own dollar after recording 500 billion percent inflation and switched to foreign currency.
