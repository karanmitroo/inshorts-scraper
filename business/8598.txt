Telecom regulator TRAI has said that telecom operators would be liable for any non-compliance of rules by third party vendors such as websites and apps for issues related to bill payment and recharges. Since third party entities are non-licensed and are hired by telecom operators, they in turn are responsible for ensuring compliance of regulatory norms, TRAI stated.
