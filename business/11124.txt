The Income Tax (I-T) Department has launched an ATM-based validation system for online filing of income tax returns. Under the initiative, the electronic verification code needed to validate returns on the e-filing portal of the I-T department can be generated through the ATM where the taxpayer has an account. Currently, only SBI has initiated the facility, an I-T official said.
