Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who had overtaken Bill Gates to become the world's richest man, returned to the second position within four hours on Thursday. Bezos' fortune had risen to over $90 billion in anticipation of Amazon's quarterly earnings, but fell to about $88.7 billion by the time markets closed. Bezos first appeared on Forbes billionaires list in 1998.
