The RBI on Monday announced a scheme for the restructuring of bank's stressed assets, under which they will be allowed to convert up to half of their loans held by corporate borrowers into equity and other securities. The move is reportedly aimed to reduce the bank's rising bad loans and increase credit flow to crucial sectors like infrastructure and manufacturing.
