Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said new MRP will have to be printed on around 200 consumer products with revised GST rates. The manufacturers will have to put stickers of reduced MRP along with old MRP to pass on the benefits of reduction in GST. Failing to do so may lead to action against the firm, Paswan added.
