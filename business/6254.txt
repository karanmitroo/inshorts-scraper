Asserting that Vijay Mallya wasn't given even "a rupee benefit" under the Modi government, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, loans were given to him during the previous government's rule. Giving "indiscriminate" loans to select people led to the massive non-performing assets of banks, he added. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the current government gave a â‚¹1,200 crore benefit to Mallya.
