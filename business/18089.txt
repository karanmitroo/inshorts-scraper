A CAG audit has found that the combined investments of Rs 3,000 crore by Jamsetji Tata Trust and Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust are in prohibitive modes, which means that it cannot be accepted as charitable in nature. Considering the misuse of income tax exemptions, the government has initiated steps to recover over Rs 1,000 crore from the two trusts.
