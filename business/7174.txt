The I-T Department has identified an additional 67.54 lakh potential income tax non-filers who carried out high-value transactions in 2014-15 but did not file income returns. While the government urges all taxpayers to disclose their true income and pay taxes, the department will continue to pursue the non-filers vigorously till all high potential non-filers are covered, it said.
