The Indian rupee tumbled 30 paise to trade over 28-month low at 68.05 against the US dollar in early trade on Wednesday. Analysts attributed the fall to strong demand for the dollar from importers and banks amid a lower opening in the domestic equity market. The rupee had hit a record low of 68.85 against the dollar in August 2013.
