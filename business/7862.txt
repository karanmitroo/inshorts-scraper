The upper house of the Bhutan parliament has decided against ratifying the road connectivity plan involving Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN). The BBIN agreement was earlier signed in Bhutanâ€™s capital Thimphu in July and will become operational only when all the four countries ratify it. India, Bangladesh, and Nepal have already ratified the pact.
