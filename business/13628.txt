The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday postponed the issue date of Sovereign Gold Bond from November 26 to November 30 to “enable smooth uploading of applications” into its e-Kuber system. “Large number of applications has been received by banks and post offices,” the RBI added. Under the scheme, investors would be paid 2.75% interest per annum semi-annually.
