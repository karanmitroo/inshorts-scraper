India's headline inflation (measured by Wholesale Price Index) rose from 5.79% in July to a six-month high of 6.10% in August (against the expected 5.8% rate), while food inflation shot to a 3-year high of 18.18%. The reason behind the escalation is being attributed to rising prices of food and vegetables, and 245% annual surge in onion prices.
