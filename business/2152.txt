US stock index Dow Jones on Tuesday mistakenly published a fake report that technology giant Google was buying Apple for $9 billion. The report mentioned that the deal, struck between Alphabet CEO Larry Page and the late Steve Jobs, was set to close tomorrow. Later, the company apologised for the report and claimed that it was a "technical error".
