Japanese conglomerate Toshiba has sued its chip business partner Western Digital for $1 billion on 'interfering' in the sale of its flash memory chip unit. Toshiba plans to use cash from the sale to balance a massive loss in its nuclear power business. Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has accused Toshiba of breaching joint venture contracts.
