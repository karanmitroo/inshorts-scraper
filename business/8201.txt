A write-down is the reducing of the book value of an asset because it is overvalued compared to the market value. It typically occurs on a company's financial statement, when the value of the asset can no longer be justified as fair value. Japan's SoftBank has written down the value of its investments in Ola and Snapdeal by $555 million.
