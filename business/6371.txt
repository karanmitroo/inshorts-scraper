Telecom regulator TRAI has given a clean chit to Reliance Jio's free voice and data plan, saying the offer does not violate regulatory guidelines on promotional offers. In a letter to Airtel and Idea, TRAI said Jio's 'Happy New Year Offer' is not violative of the non-discrimination and non-predation principles. Earlier, TRAI asked Jio why its promotional offer wasn't “predatory”.
