Saudi Arabia has slashed pay packages of its ministers by about 20% and cut other perks to government employees in a bid to save money amid low global oil prices, state-run media reported on Monday. Notably, Saudi government employees constitute about two-thirds of the country's working population. Saudi Arabia had posted a record budget deficit of $100 billion last year.
