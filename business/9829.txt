World's largest miner by market capitalisation, BHP Billiton on Tuesday cut the short-term bonus of its CEO Andrew Mackenzie after a mine accident in Brazil killed 19 people. The Anglo-Australian miner said the board and the pay committee considered the company's performance while making the decision. Earlier, BHP had posted a record annual loss of $6.4 billion.
