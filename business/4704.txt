Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday announced that taxi aggregators like Ola and Uber will face 5% GST with effect from July 1. The 5% rate will be the lowest slab for services as per the GST regime, and will be levied on transport services. Following the implementation of GST, hailing cabs from aggregators will cost marginally less.
