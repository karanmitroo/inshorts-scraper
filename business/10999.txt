In a letter to Reliance ADAG Chairman Anil Ambani, Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain accused Ambani-run electricity distribution companies in Delhi of corruption and "fudging data to show improvement." Jain accused the BSES Yamuna and BSES Rajdhani of "atrocious" performance saying, "If there are 10 outages, the daily report from your company shows only 7 and deliberately masks out 3."
