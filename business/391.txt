Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck's users withdrew 40 billion yen (nearly ₹2,400 crore) on Tuesday after it allowed yen withdrawals for the first time since last month's hack. Coincheck had suffered the biggest cryptocurrency hack in history when about ₹3,400 crore worth XEM tokens were stolen. COO Yusuke Otsuka has said crypto withdrawals will be allowed only after necessary security checks.
