Nobel Prize-winning economist Oliver Hart has said that “the euro was a mistake” and that it “wouldn’t be a bad thing at all” if in the future, Europe abandons the single currency. Further, the EU member states are not “sufficiently homogeneous” to be considered one single entity and trying to tie them into one was an “error”, he added.
