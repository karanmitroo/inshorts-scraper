UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey has said linking of bank accounts with Aadhaar can reduce frauds by detecting fund transfers into a beneficiary account if it's verified with Aadhaar. He said banking frauds led to $3 billion loss in the last one year. "We can save $10 billion every year if all government programmes are linked with Aadhaar," he added.
