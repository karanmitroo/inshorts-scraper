A woman named Iddy Pierre-Canel has sued American Airlines for $10 million (â‚¹64 crore) for allegedly losing her daughter's ashes. American Airlines said she had not declared the ashes among the valuables she was carrying, but Pierre-Canel said this was because they were priceless. Although American Airlines returned her lost luggage after 19 days, the ashes were not inside.
