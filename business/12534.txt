State Bank of India in partnership with Snapdeal has launched a new branch 'SBI e-Smart SME' to provide working capital loans to sellers on e-commerce platforms. Sellers can apply for the loan online on Snapdeal or through the dedicated branch. The bank will use proprietary platform data and information from public domain to assess sellerâ€™s creditworthiness for sanctioning of loans.
