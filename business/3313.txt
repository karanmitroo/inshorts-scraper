Two Iranian companies have signed the country’s biggest-ever car deal, worth $778 million (nearly ₹5,000 crore) with French carmaker Renault Group to produce 1,50,000 cars, beginning in 2018. The deal follows the lifting of international sanctions after Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement. Renault has a 60% partnership in the deal and is expected to create 3,000 jobs.
