The Indian Railways on Sunday said its recently announced surge pricing scheme for premium trains, flexi-fare, will not be rolled back. However, it will also not be extended to other trains for the time being. Further, the new scheme will not prompt passengers to migrate to low-cost airlines, the Railway Ministry stated, adding that currently, all Rajdhani trains are over-booked.
