Khadi yarn, Gandhi topi, and India's national flag will not attract any tax under the new GST regime, which is to be implemented from July 1. Further, chandan tika, unbranded honey, and wick for diya have also been exempted under the new indirect tax regime. However, five 'puja samagri', namely loban, mishri, batasha, and bura, will attract a 5% GST.
