Telecom major Bharti Airtel has filed an appeal before The Advertising Standards Council of India seeking a review of its decision that sought modification or withdrawal of the company's 'fastest network' advertisement by April 11. Earlier, Reliance Jio contested the ad's claim and moved the ASCI against it. ASCI then told Airtel that its "officially" fastest network claim was misleading.
