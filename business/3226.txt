The Code on Wages Bill, which seeks to fix a national minimum wage for over 40 crore unorganised sector workers, was introduced in Lok Sabha on Thursday. It provides for the government to determine minimum wages every five years using factors like skills required for the job. Under this, the government will also fix the number of hours of work.
