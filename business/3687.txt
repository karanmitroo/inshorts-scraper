An employees union of retired Air India personnel on Wednesday termed the airline's privatisation as "unpatriotic" and "illogical" in a letter to the Civil Aviation Ministry. The union said the decision is taken in haste, at a time when the airline is on the verge of becoming profitable. It also proposed that the government waive Air India's â‚¹52,000-crore debt.
