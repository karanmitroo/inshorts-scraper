US bank JPMorgan Chase suffered a glitch that gave some customers access to other clients' accounts instead of their own. The bank said the incident affected a very limited number of customers and clarified that it did not involve any kind of hacking attempt or cyber attack. In 2014, the bank experienced a hack where 83 million accounts were compromised.
