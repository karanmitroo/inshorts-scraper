The UK's second-biggest construction company, Carillion, on Monday announced that it is liquidating its assets after rescue talks with government and banks failed. The company had $1.38-billion debt and an $827-million pension deficit. The UK government had employed Carillion to work on 450 projects including building and maintenance of hospitals, defence sites, and a high-speed rail line.
