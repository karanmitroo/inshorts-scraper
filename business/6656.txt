Yoga guru Baba Ramdev has said that it was because of Patanjali that multinational companies have sleepless nights. "No MNC comes here to give you money, they have no love for India, they are here to earn profits. They bring ₹1 with them and take back ₹100," he added. Ramdev also said he's taking Patanjali to Bangladesh and African countries.
