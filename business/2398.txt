The Confederation of All India Traders has written to Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu alleging e-commerce portals like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal are violating FDI norms. It claimed that the portals' festive season sales influence prices by creating an uneven playing field. Under the FDI policy, the portals cannot undertake retail trading activities or B2C (business-to-consumer) activities.
