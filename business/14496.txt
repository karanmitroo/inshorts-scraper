Hewlett-Packard Co on Tuesday said that it has plans to layoff 25,000 to 30,000 workers globally in its enterprise business. The cuts come after the layoff of 55,000 workers that HP announced almost a year ago. HP had earlier internally split the company into HP Enterprise and HP Inc. and would publicly be listed as different companies later this year.
