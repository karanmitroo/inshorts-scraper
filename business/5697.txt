As a one time measure, the government has decided to write off outstanding taxes of 21.54 lakh taxpayers who owe â‚¹100 or less. This is to reduce the administrative burden of maintaining very low amount of arrears. Removal of 21.54 lakh cases (16% of cases) of low-value arrears would have a positive impact, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar said.
