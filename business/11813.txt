The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) seeking initiation of deportation proceedings against liquor baron Vijay Mallya in connection with ED's money laundering probe against him. Once the process is initiated, the MEA will seek the help of its counterparts in the UK to interdict Mallya and fly him back to India.
