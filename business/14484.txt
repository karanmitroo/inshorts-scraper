Nestle has signed a research collaboration agreement with a Swiss biotech company to develop a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease. AC Immune, the biotech company, on Wednesday said that it would develop a minimally invasive diagnostic test for ‘Tau’, a protein that causes tangles in the brain, typical of Alzheimer's. This is Nestle’s second healthcare deal in a week.
