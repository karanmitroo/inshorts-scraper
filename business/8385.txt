The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has claimed that the sale of Chinese goods this Diwali was down by 60% as a result of the social media campaign urging people to boycott Chinese products. Adding that even traders showed reluctance to selling Chinese goods, the trade advocate said that India-made crackers were sold in place of Chinese crackers.
