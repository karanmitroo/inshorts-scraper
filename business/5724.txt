Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal on Wednesday said he would buy a stake of up to $2.46 billion (nearly ₹16,000 crore) in UK-based mining firm Anglo American. Agarwal, who has majority control of Hindustan Zinc through Vedanta, will make the investment through his family trust. The full stake would equate to about 13% of Anglo’s stock, making Agarwal its second-largest shareholder.
