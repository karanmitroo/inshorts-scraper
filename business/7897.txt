Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said that there is no question of rolling back the demonetisation order, adding that it was a "well-planned and executed" move by the government. Further, "In the last seven days, the banks have brought down the rush. There is no panic. It is unfortunate that some people were inconvenienced," he added.
