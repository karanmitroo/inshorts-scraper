State-run Air India has terminated services of over 400 employees who were hired on contractual basis after their retirement. The employees affected are those hired for non-technical roles and the move follows an order from the airline's CMD Pradeep Singh Kharola. The order, however, adds that exceptions could be made for officials performing critical roles on a case-by-case basis.
