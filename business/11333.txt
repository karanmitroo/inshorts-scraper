Indian Railways has partnered with French transportation services firm Thales Group to implement Train Protection Warning System (TPWS), a technology meant to prevent train accidents due to drivers' failure. Thales is currently implementing the technology on a pilot basis in Chennai. This is part of the Railways' 'zero accident mission' that was launched earlier this year.
