Bowing to a stern diktat from the aviation regulator DGCA, AirAsia India Pvt Ltd (AAIPL) has decided to allow 15kg check-in baggage to domestic flyers free of cost. Earlier, AAIPL's pre-booked baggage charges started at Rs 199 for up to 15kg. The regulator has also got the Airline to reduce the number of seats it would allocate for pre-booking.
