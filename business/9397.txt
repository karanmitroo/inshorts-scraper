Indiaâ€™s external debt stock stood at $485.6 billion for the year ended March 2016, increasing 2.2% over the previous year period, a Finance Ministry release stated. The rise in external debt was due to the increase in long-term debt, particularly NRI deposits, it stated. India continues to be a less vulnerable nation, against other indebted developing countries, it added.
