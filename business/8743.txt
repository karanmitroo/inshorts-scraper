The premature death of Zhang Rui, the 44-year-old Founder and CEO of China-based health startup Chunyu, due to a heart attack has raised concerns over the 70-hour work week in the country's technology sector. When Chunyu was founded in 2011, it required working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, said the startup's spokesperson.
