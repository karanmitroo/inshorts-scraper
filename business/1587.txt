Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Saturday said that he does not foresee any further changes in the GST rate structure in the near future. The recent reduction in rates on mass consumer goods items has resolved nearly 90% of the problems and discontentment, he added. As and when the need arises, rates on other items may be changed, he said.
