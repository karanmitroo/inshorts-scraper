Prasar Bharati is planning to experiment with a pilot project for broadcasting TV channels on smartphones directly, without using internet or telecom broadband. The project will begin with 20 free-to-air channels, including Doordarshan, to be received through a dongle or an inbuilt chip. Prasar Bharti has sent a blueprint of the plan to I&B Ministry and is conducting in-house tests.
