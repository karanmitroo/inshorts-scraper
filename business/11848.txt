The government has decided to increase the minimum wages of contract labourers to â‚¹10,000 per month and a notification will be issued within a week, said Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya on Sunday. The passage of amendment to the Minimum Wages Act, ensuring a hike in the labourers' wages, was delayed due to non-cooperation from the Opposition, he added.
