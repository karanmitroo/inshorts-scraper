BSE Sensex on Wednesday rebounded 373.62 points to close at 27,251.10 while NSE Nifty rose 108.5 and closed at 8235.45. The rise was boosted after retail inflation reduced to a four-month low in April and industrial output growth slipped to a five-month low in March, increasing chances of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank.
