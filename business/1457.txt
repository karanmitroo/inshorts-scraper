The Election Commission and Facebook on Monday announced a partnership under which youths who recently turned 18 would be sent reminders on their Facebook profiles to vote. The reminder will be sent in 13 languages, including English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, and Urdu. The message will have a "register now" button which will take users to the National Voters' Services Portal.
