The European Commission has found that the world's largest automaker, Volkswagen, broke consumer laws in 20 European Union nations by cheating on emissions tests, German newspaper Die Welt reported. The German automaker has pledged billions of euros to compensate the owners of VW diesel-powered cars but has rejected calls for similar payments for the 8.5 million affected vehicles in Europe.
