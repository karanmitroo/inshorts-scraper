Democratic lawmakers have asked Deutsche Bank to hire an independent auditor to review private accounts held by US President Donald Trump and his family to determine financial ties to Russia. It was also asked to provide documentation on underwriting of loans made to Trump and family. Notably, Deutsche gave $300 million to Trump before he became president, despite failed businesses.
