Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, who has been accused in PNB's $1.77-billion scam, has claimed that his brother and wife have been "wrongly named" in the bank's FIR. He said that both of them aren't connected with any business operations. Nirav added that his uncle Mehul Choksi too has been wrongly named as he has an "independent and unconnected business".
