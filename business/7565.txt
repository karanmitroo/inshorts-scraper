The Reserve Bank of India has cut short the deadline to use old ₹500 notes at petrol pumps and for buying airline tickets from December 15 to December 2. The decision comes after the government assessed that the exemption was being misused to launder black money. Petrol pumps will continue to issue cash up to ₹2,000 against debit cards.
