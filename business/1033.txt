Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said there is no mechanism to prevent misuse of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin by terror groups. "One of the features of cryptocurrency is that there is lack of dependence on the state. It functions with a degree of anonymity," he said. Government is awaiting the report of an expert group on the subject, he added.
