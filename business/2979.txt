Former RBI governor D Subbarao on Wednesday said cost of demonetisation has been paid in last eight months and benefits will be felt over the long term. He said, "Thousands of jobs were lost...people had to stand in long lines. There had been a lot of pain". He further added that drive towards digitalisation does not necessarily require demonetisation.
