Coffee chain Starbucks has said its business hasn't been hurt by a social media boycott campaign started in response to its promise to hire 10,000 refugees globally. Starbucks made the refugee hiring announcement after US President Donald Trump's first executive order that temporarily banned travel from seven mostly Muslim nations. The firm's policy started a #BoycottStarbucks movement on Twitter.
