The Telecom Department is in the favour of giving more penal power to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, allowing it to fine telecom operators for poor services like call drops, according to reports. However, it does not favour the up to two-year imprisonment power sought by TRAI. The proposal has reportedly been submitted for the Telecom Minister's approval.
