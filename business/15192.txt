iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn Technology, is reportedly planning to start manufacturing Appleâ€™s iPhones in India. This would lower the prices of the devices in the country as the company aims to develop 10-12 facilities in India, including factories and data centres by 2020. The company is reportedly seeing an accelerating wage inflation in China, where it makes most of its iPhones.
