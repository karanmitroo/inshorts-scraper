Telecom regulator TRAI's Chairman RS Sharma has slammed recent reports on Aadhaar database breach, calling it an "orchestrated campaign". He said database breach occurs when a system is weak, adding that the reported database breach was only a "breach of trust". No Aadhaar data has been leaked in the seven years of its existence, he added.
