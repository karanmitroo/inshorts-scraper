RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday in the apex bankâ€™s annual report said that although the economy is 'showing signs of picking up', it is still below India's capability levels. The key weakness is in investment but growth is possible with reforms like the GST Bill, he stated. Inflation projections are at the upper limit, constricting rate cuts, he added.
