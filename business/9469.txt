Reacting to the $14 billion fine on Germany's Deutsche Bank by the US Department of Justice, a user tweeted, "You tax Apple €13bn, we'll fine DB $14bn," a reference to the €13 billion ($14.5 billion) fine on American tech company Apple by the European Union last month. Notably, both Apple and Deutsche Bank have refused to comply with the verdicts.
