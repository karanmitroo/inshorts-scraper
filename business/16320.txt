Inflows of foreign direct investment into India have increased by about 25% to $17.35 billion in the April-October period of the current fiscal year, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Monday. She attributed the rise to improvement in the macroeconomic situation and investor sentiment. The country had received $13.82 billion foreign inflows in the same period last year.
