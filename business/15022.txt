International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, has said that a new programme to revive Greece’s economy would be possible only if the country's creditors restructure the debt. Last week, the IMF had said that Greece’s EU creditors should double the debt payback period and pay up 36 billion euros ($40 billion) more to revive the country’s economy.
