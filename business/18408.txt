Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, said the 17 EU countries that use the euro saw their collective economic output increase by 0.3% in the April to June period from the previous quarter. The improvement was largely due to solid growth of 0.7% in Germany and a strong 0.5% bounce-back in France following two quarters of negative growth.
