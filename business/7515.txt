Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio may face a ₹500 penalty for using PM Narendra Modi’s photograph in its advertisements. This is because improper usage of emblems and names for professional and commercial purposes is prohibited by law. Earlier, Minister of State for I&B Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said the government gave no permission to Jio to use the PM's pictures.
