The Debt Recovery Tribunal on Tuesday directed Airbus to deposit with it ₹192.51 crore, which the European aircraft manufacturer had received as pre-delivery payment on behalf of the now defunct Vijay Mallya-controlled Kingfisher Airlines. Airbus has been given eight weeks time to submit the amount. Kingfisher Airlines currently owes over ₹9,000 crore to the SBI-led consortium of 17 banks.
