Citibank India has banned the use of its credit and debit cards towards purchase or trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It said the decision came following concerns expressed by the RBI regarding potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The government had said it will take all measures to eliminate use of cryptocurrencies in illegitimate activities but did not declare them illegal.
