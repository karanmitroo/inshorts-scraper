India’s dominant services industry reportedly contracted for the second consecutive month in June as new business declined. The trend suggested Asia’s third-largest economy to be struggling to maintain growth. The Nikkei Services Purchasing Managers' Index (compiled by Markit) dropped to a 15-month low of 47.7 in June from May's 49.6, well below the level 50 that separates growth from contraction.
