Liquor baron Vijay Mallya has reportedly offered to pay the principal amount (around ₹4,500 to ₹5,000 crore) that his defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes the banks. It was reported that Mallya seeks to negotiate with the banks to reduce the interest component which is around ₹2,000 crore. Vijay Mallya was recently declared a "wilful defaulter" by banks like SBI.
