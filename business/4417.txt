State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is keen to buy fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) in a ₹42,254 crore deal. Following up on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s budget announcement of creating an integrated oil firm, ONGC evaluated options of buying either HPCL or BPCL. However, it found Bharat Petroleum Corp too expensive, reports said.
