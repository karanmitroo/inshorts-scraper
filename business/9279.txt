No chief executive at the US' 100 largest companies donated to Republican Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign till August, a report stated. This is in contrast to the 2012 election, when nearly one-third of the Fortune 100 CEOs supported the then Republican nominee. Notably, 11 of the top 100 CEOs have backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while the rest supported neither.
