Japan's government is seeking $3.8 billion from the sale of Kyushu Railway's shares in an initial public offering (IPO), poised to be the second biggest in 2016, reports said. Japan has been privatising nation's train operators since 1990s, after the breakup of Japan Railways into seven for-profit companies in 1987. Kyushu is the fourth of those firms issuing an IPO.
