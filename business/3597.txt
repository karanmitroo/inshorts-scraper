Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that non-residents are not required to provide foreign bank account details in tax returns unless they are seeking tax refund. CBDT said that NRIs with no bank accounts in India, were facing difficulties in getting refunds as earlier there was no provision for reporting foreign bank account details for this purpose.
