The domestic stainless steel industry has urged the government to raise import duty on stainless steel products to 12.5% from the current 7.5%. This follows a rise in stainless steel flat product imports, which hit a record 5.32 lakh tonne in 2015-16 (25% of the total domestic demand). The industry requires short-term support to meet debt obligations, an official said.
