The new ₹2,000 and ₹500 denomination notes have been examined by intelligence agencies including RAW, IB and DRI, and have been found to be next to impossible to copy for Pakistan, a top official said. According to reports, a dedicated mint in Pakistan's Peshawar prints fake ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, which are pushed into India through criminal networks.
