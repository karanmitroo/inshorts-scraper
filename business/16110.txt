Following Uber's announcement of resumption of taxi services in Delhi, the government has said that the company cannot operate in the national capital as the ban imposed on it last month has not been revoked. The Delhi government will consider it "totally illegal" if Uber resumes its service without getting license from the Transport Department, according to sources.
