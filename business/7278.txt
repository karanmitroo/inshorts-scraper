Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that demonetisation was suggested in 1971 when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister and that the country was "very much late in implementing it". The delay has "ruined our country", Modi stated. "Had it (demonetisation) been done in 1971, the nation wouldn't have been in this situation today," Modi added.
