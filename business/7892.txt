The NDA government has spent ₹10 crore as part of its advertising campaign to promote and create awareness about its demonetisation drive. The advertising plan includes billboards, print media ads and radio commercials. Further, the central idea of the campaign is to assure people about their wealth with ads carrying taglines like “Don’t panic, your money is safe”.
