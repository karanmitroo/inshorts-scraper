Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's affiliate Ant Financial has banned consumer loans with annual interest rates above 24% from its payment platform Alipay. Ant Financial said that it has introduced the rule so that the business partners "better protect consumers." Ant Financial added that it found cases involving interest rates above the legal limit and with "inappropriate collection methods."
