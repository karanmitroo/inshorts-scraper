A criminal case has been registered in Hyderabad against Verizon Data Services India for using bouncers and forcefully extracting resignations from employees. Over 500 people were told to leave in Chennai and over 200 in Hyderabad. "The bouncers pushed me back into my chair and held me by my shoulders till I signed the document," an employee alleged.
