Using the example of Air India, animal rights organisation PETA has urged airlines to stop serving non-vegetarian meals onboard. It said, "PETA is encouraging all Indian airlines to follow Air India's lead and serve exclusively healthy, humane and eco-friendly vegan meals." It added, "Balancing an airline's carbon footprint can start with putting meat and dairy products on the no-fly list."
