Search giant Google is planning to close its news-linking service in Spain on Dec 16, following a new law which will enable publishers to force Internet sites to pay for re-publishing headlines or snippets of news. After the shut down, readers all over the world will not find links to articles from any Spanish news publishers on Google News.
