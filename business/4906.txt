Delta Airlines apologised on Thursday after a couple said they were kicked off a flight with their two toddlers so their seats could be given to waiting passengers. Delta said it was "sorry for the unfortunate experience". The couple claimed they were threatened with jail and "foster care" for their children after refusing to give up a seat.
