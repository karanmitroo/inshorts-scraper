The People’s Bank of China said it has tightened requirements for lenders to report cross-border transactions by customers to curb money laundering. The central bank will require financial institutions to report any cross-border transfers of $28,800 (around ₹20 lakh) or more starting July 1, it said in a statement. The new rules are also intended to prevent terrorism financing.
