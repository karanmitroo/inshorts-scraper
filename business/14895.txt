The Labour Ministry is set to limit premature PF withdrawals to 75% in an attempt to check 'misutilisation' of funds. EPFO subscribers shall receive 75% of deposits in case of unemployment for 2 months, while the remaining 25% shall be paid to the subscriber at the age of 58 years. The Ministry will soon issue a notification in this regard.
