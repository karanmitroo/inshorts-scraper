The government has planned to change security features of ₹2,000 and ₹500 banknotes every 3-4 years in accordance with the global standards to keep a check on counterfeiting. The move came after fake currency notes were recovered post demonetisation. The security features in newly introduced notes are same as that of old notes, the MHA officials have said.
