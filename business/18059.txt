With $250 million raised in a new funding round, online music-streaming service Spotify is now one of the world's richest start-ups. Spotify, launched in Oct-2008, has now a market value of over $4 billion with operations in 32 countries. Spotify and other competitors like Pandora, despite soaring popularity, struggle to make profit due to the cost of royalty fees.
