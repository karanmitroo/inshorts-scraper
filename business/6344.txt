Bharti Airtel has filed a complaint against Reliance Jio with the Competition Commission of India (CCI), accusing it of “creating a monopoly for itself”. Jio’s “predatory" pricing strategy aims to “injure competition”, Airtel stated. Once Jio obtains a higher share, it may even charge for voice calls since customers will be left with fewer operators to choose from, it added.
