The Tata Group filed an application in the London Commercial Court on Monday against an arbitration court order directing Tatas to pay $1.17 billion to Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo. DoCoMo accused Tata of "re-litigating arguments" that were rejected by the court. Notably, the Tatas claim they cannot pay the amount to DoCoMo as the RBI did not give its approval.
