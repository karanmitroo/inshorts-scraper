Patanjali will soon enter the textile manufacturing sector, its founder and Yoga guru Ramdev said on Saturday and expressed hope that the group’s growth rate will swell to 200% in 2017-18. Apart from traditional kurta-pyjama, Patanjali will also come out with foreign wears like jeans, Ramdev added. “India has all potential to become a big global manufacturing centre," he stated.
