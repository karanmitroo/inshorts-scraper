At a meeting of the American Economic Association, Nobel Prize-winning economists criticised the economic plans of US President-elect Donald Trump. Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps said Trump's "dangerous" policies could lead to an explosion of public debt leading to a "deep recession". He further compared Trump's policies to that of fascist governments in Italy and Germany in the 1930s.
