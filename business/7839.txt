The Reserve Bank of India on Friday informed the Madras High Court that it cannot disclose details regarding the release of new ₹500 denomination currency to the banks for distribution due to security reasons. The High Court had sought to know when the new ₹500 notes would be made available in Tamil Nadu to ease cash crunch following demonetisation.
