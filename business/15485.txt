PepsiCo said Friday that it would remove sweetener aspartame from Diet Pepsi, as it is not considered safe by customers in US, and replace it with sucralose. The step comes after sale of rival Diet Coke, also containing aspartame, fell by 5% in North America during last quarter. American agencies said that higher amount of aspartame may cause health issues.
