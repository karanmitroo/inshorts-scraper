Cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which surged to a record high of over $7,880 on global exchanges last week, traded at $13,900 during the same period on Zimbabwean bitcoin exchange, Golix. Zimbabweans are reportedly moving to Bitcoin to protect their investments from the country's hyperinflation. They also make foreign payments in Bitcoin owing to restrictions from the country's central bank, reports said.
