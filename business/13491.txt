Prices for Iron ore with 62% Iron content fell to $39.06 per tonne on Monday, their lowest levels since 2009. "Iron ore remains an oversupplied market where production costs are coming down, there's hardly anything that can stop prices from falling further," said a Julius Baer analyst. Iron prices have fallen 80% since 2011 and nearly 30% since October.
