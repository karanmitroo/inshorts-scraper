Financial services firm Mastercard on Thursday unveiled a new consumer-facing logo, the first redesign in 20 years. “One of the...changes was to lowercase the “C” in card...to de-emphasize how we are not just a card,” the company said. This comes as part of a rebranding exercise, which also involves the rollout of Mastercard's digital payment service Masterpass later this month.
