A Mumbai court on Friday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant and an extradition order against beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya in a service tax default case. The service tax department had issued a notice to now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines for dues of â‚¹87.5 crore in 2011-12. The airline reportedly collected service tax from passengers, but didn't deposit it with the department.
