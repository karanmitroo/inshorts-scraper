The government has suspended 27 officials posted at various public sector banks and transferred six officials to non-sensitive posts for violating RBI instructions, the Finance Ministry said. It warned that illegalities will not be tolerated and appropriate action will be taken against those involved in unauthorised activities. This comes amid I-T raids being conducted following demonetisation.
