The Central Information Commission (CIC) has dismissed the plea asking for the basis for giving huge loans to Gautam Adani Group along with the evidence that the loan was connected to the coal mines of Australia. It held that SBI cannot disclose records of loans given to Adani group as the bank holds these as trustees and include confidential information.
