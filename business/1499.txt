Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Saturday said it is mandatory for the big companies to pass on the benefit of reduced GST to end-consumers. "If we see any anomaly we will not get hold of the small retailers, we will catch the bigger companies," Adhia said. The GST Council had recently lowered rates on 178 items from 28% to 18%.
