Air India has grounded 34 cabin crew members, including 30 air hostesses, due to high Body Mass Index, the government said. Cabin crew who are in the obese category are grounded to enable them to attain prescribed limits, Union Minister Jayant Sinha said. Notably, cabin crew members found overweight are deemed temporarily unfit and given three months to reduce weight.
