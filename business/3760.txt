Five employees of Canada’s spy agency have filed a $27.7 million (₹178 crore) lawsuit against their employer, seeking damages after years of bullying. They alleged the agency is rife with harassment, racism, homophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment. Additionally, an officer alleged his manager sent him an email saying, “Careful your Muslim in-laws don’t behead you in your sleep for being homo”.
