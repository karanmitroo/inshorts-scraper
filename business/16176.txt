The diesel price decontrol has encouraged Reliance Industries to re-open 230 of its 1,400 fuel stations, which were shut down after heavily subsidised sales by state-run firms took a toll on them. The company plans to commission the entire network within a year. RIL and Essar Oil Ltd together held about 17% of domestic retail market for diesel by 2006.
