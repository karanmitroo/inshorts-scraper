Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday, after Moody's upgraded India's bond rating, said that many who had doubts on the government's reforms would now seriously introspect on their own positions. He hailed India's improved rating calling it a "belated recognition" of reforms in the last few years. He added it is "encouraging" to see international recognition.
