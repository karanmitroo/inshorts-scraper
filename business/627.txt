Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has arrived at the Parliament with the Budget briefcase to present the Union Budget 2018. As per tradition, he met President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan before reaching the Parliament. In a break from tradition, Jaitley will likely deliver his Budget speech in Hindi, becoming the first Finance Minister to do so since Independence.
