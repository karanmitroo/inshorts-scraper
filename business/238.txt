Jeweller Mehul Choksi's lawyer Sanjay Abert has said all loans taken by Gitanjali Group are "legal" and will be repaid soon. While denying allegations by Gitanjali's employees that Choksi overpriced the jewellery, Abert asked why the employees remained silent when the fraud was taking place. Choksi and Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding PNB of $1.77 billion.
