Industry body COAI has termed the launch of JioPhone at an "effective zero price" as a "clever marketing" position because the move will help the company save licence fee and other government levies. COAI Director General Rajan Mathews further termed the phone's launch as "clearly a big win for Jio" that will put pressure on incumbent telecom operators.
