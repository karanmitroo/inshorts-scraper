Infosys on Monday said some of its promoters have communicated their intention to participate in its proposed ₹13,000 crore share buyback programme. The Infosys founders and their families hold about 12.75% of Infosys. Notably, the share buyback price of ₹1,150 is higher than the current trading price of around ₹940, which former CFO V Balakrishnan termed as "reasonably good".
