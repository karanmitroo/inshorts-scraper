A UK man who tried to purchase a Bitcoin miner costing nearly â‚¹3 lakh from Amazon in November last year received a DVD copy of animated film 'Boss Baby' instead. He said Amazon had refused a refund twice as his wife had unintentionally signed for the product. However, a refund was issued on January 20 after a third claim.
