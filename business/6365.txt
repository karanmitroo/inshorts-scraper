IT industry body Nasscom's President R Chandrashekhar has said that CEOs of India's biggest IT companies will meet US lawmakers to dissuade them from raising H-1B visa requirements. "We want to put across to the new administration what would be lost by America closing those doors," said Chandrashekhar. TCS, Infosys, and Wipro are among the biggest users of H-1B visas.
