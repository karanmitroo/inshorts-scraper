Facebook-owned virtual reality startup Oculus has been ordered to pay $500 million to game company ZeniMax as Oculus Co-founder Palmer Luckey violated a non-disclosure agreement with ZeniMax. ZeniMax had sued Oculus for $4 billion and also accused it of stealing its technology. Earlier, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned in court where he said, "I've never heard of ZeniMax before".
