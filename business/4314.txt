The CBI has said there was no delay in forwarding evidence to UK authorities for extradition of absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya. The clarification came after reports said a UK judge mocked India on being told that evidence against Mallya would arrive after three-four weeks. Notably, Mallya, who owes over â‚¹9,000 crore to banks, fled to UK in 2016.
