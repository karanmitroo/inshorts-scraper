Blaming the then government's policies for the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines, Vijay Mallya said he had "begged for help" and not for loans. Mallya said he sought policy changes that he didn't get, which hurt his airlines. He further claimed that public funds were used to bail out Air India, but not Kingfisher, which was the "largest domestic airline" then.
