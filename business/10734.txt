A US State department report has said India's approximate economic growth rate of 7.5% "may be overstated" as the investor sentiment remains "depressed" in the country. The report said the BJP-led government has been "slow to propose" reforms to "match its rhetoric". Further, it said many reforms "struggled to pass through [the] Parliament" which resulted in investors' lack of confidence.
