Indian e-commerce portal Infibeam on Wednesday filed for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise 4.5 billion rupees, becoming the first e-retailer to list shares in the domestic market. The move comes amid fierce competition in the Indian e-commerce sector with rivals Flipkart and Amazon. Flipkart had earlier said it wasn't prepared for the stock market and investor scrutiny yet.
