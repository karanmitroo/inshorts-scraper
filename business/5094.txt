Maintaining that service charge is voluntary, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan asked, "Does the service charge reach employees?" At present, it's not known "how much or if at all fully or a part of the service charge" is distributed amongst hotel staff, he stated. In this regard, he said hotels should make public the amount actually given to employees.
