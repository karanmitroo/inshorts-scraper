Largest Indian drug-maker Sun Pharmaceutical's Founder Dilip Shanghvi saw his fortune plunge by $14.1 billion (nearly â‚¹91,000 crore) in two years. Shanghvi, once India's richest person, recently slipped to the sixth position with an $11.1 billion fortune. The drop came after the company's shares tumbled 57% since April 2015 due to weak earnings and US inspections at a key plant.
