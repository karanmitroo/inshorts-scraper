Social networking site Facebook paid $5.16 million in UK corporation tax in 2015, which is 1,000 times more than $5,367 paid in 2014. Notably, until this year, Facebook's transactions were booked in Ireland, minimising its UK tax bill, analysts said. The company said its UK arm generated a $13.6 million tax credit in 2015 due to its tax efficient structure.
