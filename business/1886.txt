A Japanese company has granted non-smoking employees extra six days of paid holidays a year. The decision came after a staffer's complaint that non-smokers were working more than their colleagues, who took regular cigarette breaks. "I hope to encourage employees to quit smoking through incentives rather than penalties or coercion," a company official said.
