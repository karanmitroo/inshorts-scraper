Delta Airlines is facing criticism for removing a passenger who went to the bathroom while the plane was delayed on the runway. The first time he tried to leave his seat, the man was told  by flight attendants that he could not use the lavatory. But as the delay continued, he rose and quickly went to the bathroom.
