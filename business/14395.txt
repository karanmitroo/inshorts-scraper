Reserve Bank of India is set to increase the limits for foreign investment (FPI) in central government securities to 5% of the outstanding stock in phases by March 2018. This move "would open up room for an additional investment of Rs 1.2 trillion", giving space to bring down statutory liquidity ratio for banks. RBI also introduced FPIs in state bonds.
