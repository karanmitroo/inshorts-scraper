Telecom regulator TRAI has directed Idea Cellular to deposit nearly â‚¹3 crore for overcharging its subscribers for making calls to BSNL and MTNL networks. TRAI penalised Idea after it found that it levied differential tariffs in four states during the period from May 2005 to January 2007. Idea has been instructed to report compliance within 15 days of this direction.
