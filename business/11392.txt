UK-based Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) on Monday said it will shut down its corporate, institutional and retail banking operations in India, following the announcement of the plan last year. RBS currently operates 10 retail branches in India employing 400 people. This is part of the bank's plan to reduce its international operations to 13 countries from the current 38.
