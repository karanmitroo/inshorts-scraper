The Adani Group on Monday said that it has cancelled a $1.5 billion contract with a mining services company for work on its proposed Carmichael coal mine in Australia. This comes a week after the Queensland government vetoed a concessional loan for the controversy-hit coal mine. Recently, three Chinese state lenders have refused to back the project.
