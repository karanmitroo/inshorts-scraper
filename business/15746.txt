Setting its foot firmly in the Indian market, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi will open 100 experience centres across the country. In these centres, customers will be able to get their hands on devices before buying. They will also act as service centres for users. The products, however, will continue to sell exclusively on Flipkart.
