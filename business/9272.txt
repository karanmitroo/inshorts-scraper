An inter-ministerial panel on Monday reportedly approved 11 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) proposals worth ₹2,325 crore, including that of tech giant IBM and clothing brand Pepe Jeans. It also accepted the French bank BNP Paribas' ₹2,060 crore FDI proposal to acquire 100% share capital of local brokerage firm Sharekhan, reports said. The panel had earlier rejected Paribas' proposal in June.
