Shares of India's third largest IT company Wipro surged nearly 5.5% on Monday in its biggest gain during intraday trade since January 19, 2015. This comes after its board decided to consider a share buyback proposal next week. If the decision follows through, it will be the second time in years that the IT giant will buy back shares.
