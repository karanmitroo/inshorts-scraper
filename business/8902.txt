India, the worldâ€™s fourth largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, will see its demand for LNG double in the next four years, to 30 million metric tonnes, a Citi Research report said. The report attributed the spike in India's demand to lower LNG prices due to global oversupply and the country's own increasing demand from the power and fertilizer sector.
