The Bank of Japan on Thursday decided to keep the interest rates on the current accounts held by financial institutions unchanged at (-)0.1% and kept the annual target for expanding the monetary base at 80 trillion yen ($764 billion). Further, the inflation is "likely to be slightly negative or about 0% for the time being", the central bank said.
