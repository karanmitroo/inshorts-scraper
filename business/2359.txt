Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is "working over-time" to make sure all Indians see poverty in close quarters. Sinha slammed the government saying "economies are destroyed more easily than they are built". Sinha added Jaitley failed to take corrective measures in time as "he was carrying the heavy burden of so many extra responsibilities".
