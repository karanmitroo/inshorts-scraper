The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has restored India's safety rating to Category-I, fourteen months after it was downgraded to category-II. The FAA informed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation about the move in a letter to the regulator and the civil aviation ministry. Category-I rating permits air carriers to add flights to the US using their own aircraft.
