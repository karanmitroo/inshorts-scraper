Corporate Affairs Ministry has said that companies can have only two layers of subsidiaries under the companies law. However, banking, non-banking financial companies as well as insurance firms and government companies have been exempted from the restrictions. Further, companies that already have more than two layers of subsidiaries have to furnish details about them to the government in 150 days.
