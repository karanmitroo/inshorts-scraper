Employees of Bank of England went on a three-day strike, which was the UK central bank's first strike in over 50 years. Around 40 workers, including maintenance and security workers, were carrying signs reading "Bank of England staff want fair pay". A union official said the workers had "been left with no choice but to take industrial action".
