Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that he was confident that India would "shine like gold" after the government's decision to demonetise high-value currency notes. "Just like gold we will emerge glowing from this fire. The main reason behind this confidence is our people," he stated. Those with high amount of black money will suffer the most, Modi added.
