Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said that replacing 86% of the currency in circulation with new notes could not have been executed in a better way than currently being implemented. Replacing such a large currency without any social unrest and any significant economic disruption was an “achievement”, he said. "It’s moving smoothly as everyday passes by," Jaitley added.
