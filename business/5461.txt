RS Sodhi, MD of Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, which runs Amul, said multinational companies "think companies like ours are from the villages so we wouldnâ€™t know anything". Commenting on HUL's complaint against Amul's ice-cream ad, Sodhi said, "It is a case of multinational ego." "They feel they have the best of brains and the best of lawyers," he added.
