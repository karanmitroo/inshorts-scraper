India’s exports of goods fell 17.2% in dollar terms to $267 billion in 2015, according to figures released by the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday. The country’s imports also dropped 15.3% to $392 billion, largely due to a nearly 60% fall in oil prices. Further, India’s commercial services’ exports grew by 1.2% while imports fell by 1.1% last year.
