A family was kicked off a Las Vegas-bound JetBlue flight because of a staff dispute over a birthday cake. The family had brought a cake onboard, and flight attendants started arguing over where it should be stored. Although a security officer said, "I don't see any wrongdoing," the other passengers on the flight were made to leave and reboard.
