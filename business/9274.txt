Thailand is planning to toughen tax collection rules for internet and technology firms including search giant Google, amid growing scrutiny of the tax affairs of such firms in South-east Asia. This would also cover mobile transfers and the internet payment sector, Director General of Thailand's Revenue Department said. Notably, Indonesia is currently pursuing Google for five years of back taxes.
