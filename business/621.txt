Telecom regulator TRAI on Wednesday slashed the charges for Mobile Number Portability (MNP) by almost 79% to a maximum of ₹4. The prescribed ceiling for MNP rates was ₹19 till now. TRAI said the earlier ceiling of ₹19 was "quite high" owing to low porting cost and high volume of transactions involved.
