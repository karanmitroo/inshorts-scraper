Japanese automaker Toyota topped 2015 global sales by selling 10.15 million vehicles, thereby retaining its top position for the fourth consecutive year. Volkswagen and General Motors finished behind Toyota with 9.93 million and 9.8 million vehicle sales respectively. However, Volkswagen had overtaken Toyota sales briefly in the first half of 2015, before the former's emission scandal broke out.
