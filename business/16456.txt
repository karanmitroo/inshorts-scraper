In compliance with the orders given by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), budget carrier SpiceJet has stopped bookings for flights beyond a month, leading to fare-rise. As a result of reduction in fleet, the airline had cancelled almost 1,800 flights in the past month, following which the DGCA ordered it to cease advance bookings and refund money to passengers.
