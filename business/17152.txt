The low cost carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday offered 10 lakh tickets at a base fare of Rs 999. Termed as "lower than train fares," these tickets can be booked up to Thursday for domestic travel between Jan-6 and Oct-24, 2015. The latest fares starting Rs 999, however, do not include statutory taxes. Other airlines are expected to follow the move.
