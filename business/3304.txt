Google has fired James Damore, the software engineer who wrote a 10-page controversial anti-diversity memo that went viral inside the company. The memo questioned Google's diversity efforts and blamed biological differences, not discrimination, for fewer women in technical roles. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the memo violated company's code of conduct by "advancing harmful gender stereotypes."
