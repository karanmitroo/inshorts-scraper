The Finance Ministry on Monday said only 83% effective currency is in circulation now with remonetisation. The total currency in circulation has come down to ₹14.75 trillion as of August 4, 2017 from ₹17.77 trillion as on November 8, 2016. Demonetisation has helped in removing black money, eliminating fake notes and reducing cash in circulation, the finance ministry added.
