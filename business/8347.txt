Japanese electronics major Sony on Tuesday reported an 85.7% fall in net income for the quarter ended September to $48 million, as against the previous year period. The firm's operating income also fell by 48% to $453 million. The weak results were partially due to a drop in smartphone sales and a reduction in profits from image sensors, Sony said.
