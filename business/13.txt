US President Donald Trump has slipped 222 places in the Forbes billionaires list after losing $400 million (over â‚¹2,500 crore) from last year. He is now ranked 766 in the world with $3.1 billion net worth. The magazine said the drop was partially due to a fall in the value of his properties and falling revenues at his golf courses.
