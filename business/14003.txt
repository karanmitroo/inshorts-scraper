The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept the interest rate unchanged at 0-0.25% (near-zero) following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise (rates) at its next meeting, the committee will assess progress – both realized and expected – toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation,” the Fed said in a statement.
