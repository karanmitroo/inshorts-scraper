The government is seeking to amend legislation to enable the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security to impose fines on violators. “Today, there is no provision for levying penalties. That enablement should happen,” Civil Aviation Secretary said. Currently, in case of irregularities, the entire airline's licence is suspended for a certain time.
