RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Friday that the country’s banking sector would see major changes in the coming years. “We are going to have a whole set of new institutions, payments banks, small finance banks, and we are going to possibly have postal bank. Public sector banks are going to be a tremendous change agent,” he added.
