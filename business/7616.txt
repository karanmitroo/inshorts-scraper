Philippine lender RCBC is not liable to compensate Bangladesh for $81 million that was stolen by cyber criminals in one of the biggest bank frauds ever, RCBC lawyer said on Tuesday. Further, the lender blamed the central bank in Dhaka for being "negligent". "RCBC is not the proximate cause of the theft. They have no case against us," it stated.
