The government has collected over 900 kg of gold from households and temples under the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS), Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das tweeted. Implemented in November last year, the scheme allows people to earn interest on gold deposited in banks across the country. Reportedly, an estimated 20,000 tonnes of gold is lying in households and temples in India.
