Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, who is an accused in the $1.77-billion PNB fraud, has said the bank's actions have destroyed his brand and business. Nirav said that PNB's "anxiety" to recover the dues "immediately" has closed all his options to pay back. "The matter is being described as India's largest banking fraud. This is far from the truth," he added.
