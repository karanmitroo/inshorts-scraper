The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to keep interest rates unchanged in its monetary policy review on Tuesday. However, it may cut rates by the end of 2015, depending on the monsoon. The increase in inflation over the last two months and rainfall deficit would prevent RBI from reducing rates, the Export-Import Bank of India said.
