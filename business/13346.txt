The BSE Sensex on Tuesday lost 145.25 points to close at 25,590.65 while the NSE Nifty fell by 48.35 points to settle at 7,786.10. Analysts attributed the fall to profit-booking on blue chip stocks by investors. Meanwhile, the rupee appreciated for the sixth consecutive day due to continued selling of the US dollar by banks and exporters.
