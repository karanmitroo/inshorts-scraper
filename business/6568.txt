As Budget printing at the North Block's basement in Delhi begins, officials are isolated from the outside world for over a week to maintain secrecy till Finance Minister delivers the speech. A single phone is available on which the families of officials can leave a message. Budget is usually handed over to printers at midnight, two days before its announcement.
