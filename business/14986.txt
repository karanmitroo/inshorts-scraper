Mohan Meakin Ltd, the manufacturer of popular rum brand 'Old Monk', has debunked the reports that claimed the liquor will be taken off market due to its falling sales. "Sales have dropped in a handful of states... that doesn't mean that Old Monk is doing badly. It (Old Monk) isn't going anywhere," said SN Maingi, deputy general manager, Mohan Meakin.
