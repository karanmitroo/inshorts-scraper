Irish airline Ryanair has proposed a ban on sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants before 10 am in airports, and limiting number of drinks sold per boarding pass to two. This comes after spike in alcohol-related arrests at UK airports or in the air, which increased over 50% to a total of 387 arrests from February 2016 to 2017.
