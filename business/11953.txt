Companies from Xinjiang, China signed deals with Pakistan worth approximately $2 billion this week. Pakistan agreed infrastructure and energy projects worth $46 billion with China last year. In return, China would get a free trade zone in the Gwadar port, Pakistan, and access to the Arabian Sea. The deals were signed when Xinjiang's Communist Party chief Zhang Chunxian visited Pakistan.
