Liquor baron Vijay Mallya's assets worth â‚¹700 crore have been put up for auction for the second time by a 17-bank consortium led by the SBI to recover dues linked to Mallya's now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. After the previous auction failed to attract bidders, the consortium lowered the reserve prices of properties, including the Kingfisher House and Mallya's private jet.
