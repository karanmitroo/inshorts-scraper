Germany-based supermarket chain Lidl faced criticism after it removed church crosses from its Greek range of foods. The chain's 'Eridanous' range has pictures of the Anastasis Church in Santorini, Greece, with its blue dome roof. The company claims this is part of a deliberate policy to remove all religious symbols from their packaging.
