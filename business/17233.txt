SAP Labs India managing director, Anirban Dey, quit the company on Wednesday, and set off immediate speculation that he may be heading to Infosys. Dey's exit comes less than a week after the announcement of former SAP CTO Vishal Sikka as Infosys' next CEO. Dey took over as the head of SAP Labs India in Jan last year.
