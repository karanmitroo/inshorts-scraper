President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday said, "Demonetisation, while immobilising black money and fighting corruption, may lead to temporary slowdown of the economy." "We need to be extra careful to alleviate the sufferings of poor that might become unavoidable for expected progress in the long term," he further added. Mukherjee had earlier called the demonetisation decision a "bold step".
