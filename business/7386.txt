Multi-business conglomerate Tata Sons has alleged that ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry had misled the committee set up in 2011 for selecting a Chairman to succeed the then Chairman Ratan Tata. The group said that Mistry did so by making "lofty statements" about his plans for the Tata Group but didnâ€™t bring about any changes to this effect during his tenure.
