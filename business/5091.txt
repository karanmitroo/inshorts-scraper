Ratan Tata has praised the judicial process for its "professionalism and fairness", after National Company Law Tribunal rejected Cyrus Mistry's plea against Tata Sons. Earlier, the NCLT dismissed a petition by Mistry that alleged mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at group firms. It also refused to grant waiver to Mistry firms that would've allowed them to file the petition.
