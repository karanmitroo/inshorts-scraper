Commenting on the 12% tax proposed on ayurvedic products under the new GST regime, a spokesperson of Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved said, "Increasing the GST rate on ayurvedic products is disappointing and disheartening." "Without good health or good living, there cannot be 'achhe din'," the spokesperson added. Notably, ayurveda products attract an 8%-9% tax at present.
