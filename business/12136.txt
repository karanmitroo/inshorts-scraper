Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have invested ₹16,476 crore in the Indian capital markets between March 1-23. While ₹15,660 crore was invested in equity markets, ₹816 crore were pumped into the debt markets. Analysts attributed the inflow to continued hopes of a rate cut by the RBI and the recent interest rate cut on small savings schemes.
