Electronics major Foxconn has sent nearly one fourth of its factory workers on paid leave for two weeks, according to reports. This followed a cash crunch after demonetisation, which saw the electronics firm's sales fall by nearly 50% forcing it to cut production by half. Benching may continue if production does not come to adequate level by January, sources said.
