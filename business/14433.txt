To recover investors' funds collected by the now defunct Saradha Group, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has ordered the attachment of 134 properties belonging to the firm and its chairman Sudipta Sen. The bank accounts of the group were earlier attached after it got bankrupt in April 2013 but the funds were insufficient to repay investors' dues.
