Amid Arnab Goswami's new venture Republic TV releasing advertisements before its launch, rival news channel India Today put up a similar hoarding just beside one of Republic's. In the billboard, India Today responded to Republic's poster that reads "Arnab with you soon" with "Anjana reached and waiting". Notably, Anjana Om Kashyap will anchor the prime time slot at India Today.
