Sahara Group on Monday said a Dubai-based investment fund has agreed to provide $1.6 billion (over â‚¹10,200 crore) loan against security of 26% shares of its Aamby Valley project. This came after Supreme Court rejected Subrata Roy's plea seeking more time to pay the remaining amount to refund investors, and directed authorities to continue Aamby Valley's auction process.
