Private sector lender Yes Bank has reportedly cut nearly 2,500 jobs or about 12% of its workforce, citing multiple reasons, including digitisation and poor performance. The bank said the job cuts are a part of its regular "human capital management practices". The bank had 20,851 employees at the end of June, according to exchange filings.
