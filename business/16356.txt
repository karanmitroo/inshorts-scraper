In a relief for Chinese handset maker OnePlus, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday lifted the ban on its mobile phone sales. The court had stopped OnePlus sales in India after Micromax alleged that it was infringing the exclusive rights of Micromax to use Cyanogen software, a specialised form of Android operating system (OS), and trademark.
