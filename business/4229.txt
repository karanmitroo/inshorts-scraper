The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) plans to earn as much as ₹18 lakh in one year solely through ad revenue generated from the high-speed Tejas Express. IRCTC will now allow ads to be streamed during movies on the train’s display screens, which were earlier ad-free. It will also charge passengers ₹30 for a pair of earphones.
