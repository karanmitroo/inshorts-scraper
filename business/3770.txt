Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever is competing with US canned meat producer Hormel Foods to buy the foods division of British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser, reports said. Unilever and Hormel are front-runners in a deal that is likely to reach $2.9 billion (over â‚¹18,600 crore). Earlier this month, Reckitt trimmed its sales forecast by $129 million due to a cyber attack.
