Infosys has proposed a 50MW solar park in Karnataka, becoming the first software company in India to think of generating its own power, in the process fulfilling its broader obligations to society. "We want to promote use of clean energy and reduce carbon emission. We hope to commission the park in about a year," said Infosys executive VP Ramadas Kamath.
