Traffic delays cost London $6.8 billion (over ₹46,000 crore) a year, a panel of city legislators has said. Apart from causing delays to commuters, London’s congestion has contributed to toxic levels of air pollution that breached European Union rules since 2010. In this regard, the panel has recommended a new programme to charge people more for using most congested roads.
