The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed all four bills related to the Goods and Services Tax introduced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The four bills are the Central GST Bill, the Integrated GST Bill, the GST Compensation Bill and the UT-GST Bill. The GST will aid free flow of goods and services across India and make goods cheaper, Jaitley said.
