India's merchandise exports for 2015-16 fiscal stood at $261.16 billion, down 15.9% from the year-ago period and at its weakest level since 2010-11. Exports would continue to perform poorly in 2016-17 (April-March) due to subdued global economic growth and still-depressed commodity prices, said BMI Research. Meanwhile, net imports for the fiscal stood 15.28% year-on-year down at $379.59 billion.
