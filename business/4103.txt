Former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli's hedge fund went from a success to being shut in 31 minutes, an investor revealed. Sarah Hassan, who gave Shkreli $300,000 to invest, said she got an email at 8:13 PM in September 2012, saying she was up $135,000, and at 8:44 PM a second email notified investors that Shkreli was closing the fund.
