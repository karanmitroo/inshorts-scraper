The Supreme Court of India in 1997 laid down guidelines known as 'Vishakha Guidelines' for dealing with sexual harassment at the workplace. According to the guidelines, sexual harassment means any "unwelcome sexually determined" behaviour. Such behaviour includes physical contact and advances, demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks and showing pornography among others.
