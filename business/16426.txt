On Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India on Thursday, PM Modi will discuss the delay in commissioning NTPCâ€™s Rs. 10,000-crore-Barh-I power project in Bihar, where Russian company TPE is a contractor. Given the upcoming Bihar polls, the Modi government wants early commissioning of the project. Barh-I continues to languish even as the Barh-II project has already started operations.
