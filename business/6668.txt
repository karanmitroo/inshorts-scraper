US President Donald Trump has described journalists as among the most dishonest human beings on Earth, stating he has a “running war” with the media. He warned them of consequences for falsely reporting that less people attended his inauguration. “We had a massive field of people...I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field,” Trump claimed.
