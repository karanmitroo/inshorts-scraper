The Indian Pilots' Guild has said that although it's looking forward to Air India's privatisation, around â‚¹400 crore due to pilots should be settled first. "This is a problem created by the management and they have to first resolve the issue," it stated. Air India resorted to salary cuts in 2012 amid financial difficulties, and arrears have been accumulating since.
