A Mumbai court on Saturday issued a non-bailable (NBW) warrant against industrialist Vijay Mallya in check bounce cases filed by the Airport Authority of India (AAI). AAI had filed two such cases worth over ₹100 crore against Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines. Earlier in May, the court had directed Mallya to appear before it, failing which it will issue an NBW.
