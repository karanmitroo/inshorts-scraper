During his India visit, Virgin Group Founder Richard Branson has said, "If I were an Indian a lot of my life would be spent sitting in traffic jams." "I have sat in the Indian traffic...itâ€™s not a pleasant experience," he added. Notably, Branson-backed company Virgin Hyperloop One has proposed India's first operational Hyperloop route between Mumbai and Pune by 2025.
