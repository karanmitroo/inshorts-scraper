An investor who put $200,000 into Martin Shkreli's hedge fund said Shkreli reminded him of the autistic character in movie "Rain Man". Schuyler Marshall, chairman of an investment company, said he was impressed with Shkreli's "intense focus" on one specific part of the market, day and night. Shkreli is facing fraud trial for raising an HIV drug's price by 5,400%.
