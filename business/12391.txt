The government will notify categories of employees who will be exempted from the proposed tax on Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) withdrawals, a Finance Ministry official said on Friday, following criticism by employee unions and political parties. The Union Budget 2016-17, which proposed taxing 60% of EPF withdrawals, also has an excluded employees category provision in the Finance Bill 2016.
