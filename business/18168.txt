In the largest ever deal between US-govt and a company, JPMorgan Chase has reached a tentative $13-billion deal(to settle investigations into bad mortgage loans the bank sold to investors) with US justice department and other government agencies. The deal does not release the bank from criminal liability for some of the mortgages it packaged into bonds and sold to investors.
