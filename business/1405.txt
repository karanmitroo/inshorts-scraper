The Anil Ambani-led Reliance group has said it will file a ₹5,000-crore defamation lawsuit against Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi for making "false and defamatory statements". Singhvi had alleged that the government's Rafale aircraft deal promoted the interest of Reliance. Singhvi also claimed that the government had written off ₹1.88 trillion debt of those who had wilfully defaulted.
