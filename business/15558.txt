According to a report on Reliance Industries official website, the company has planned to restart all its 1,400 retail fuel pump outlets before March 2016. These stations were closed in 2008 as fuel prices of state-owned retailers were much less than privately-owned retailers because of government's subsidy to the former. The company has already restarted over 320 fuel outlets.
