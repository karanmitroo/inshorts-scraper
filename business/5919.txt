A British Airways flight from London was delayed after crew informed the passengers they couldn't take off due to a mouse-spotting. The crew joked the mouse couldn't enter the US airspace without a passport, and that they needed a new plane, which led to a four-hour delay. British Airways apologised, saying passengers were happy to be on a mouse-free aircraft.
