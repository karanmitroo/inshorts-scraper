The $7.5 million settlement that Casino billionaire and Wynn Resorts Founder Steve Wynn paid to a former employee reportedly involved a paternity claim. Wynn had paid the amount to a manicurist who accused him of forcing her to have sex in 2005. He reportedly made the payment because he didn't want the allegations to be a distraction for his company.
