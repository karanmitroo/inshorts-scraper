Air India will hire about 100 co-pilots for its Airbus fleet to minimise delays in its flights, as per a report. The airline's poor on-time performance has been a cause of concern for its management. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's data, Air India operated only 52.1% of its flights on time in January.
