Technology giant Apple's stock has plunged 5.1% since January 22 over reports of low iPhone X demand, wiping out $46.4 billion from its market capitalisation. Nikkei on Monday reported that Apple would halve its iPhone X production for the first quarter, from over 40 million units to 20 million. It added this was due to weaker-than-expected demand for iPhone X.
