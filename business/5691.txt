Renowned economist Jagdish Bhagwati on Friday said that demonetisation will promote growth while Amartya Sen and other experts who denounced it, stand "humiliated and exposed". "I was the one economist who had argued (with my co-authors), from first principles, that demonetisation would increase, not diminish, growth," Bhagwati said. "And that is exactly what appears to have happened," he added.
