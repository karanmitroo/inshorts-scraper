SBI will charge a penalty on non-maintenance of monthly average balance in accounts starting Saturday. Further, cash withdrawals will attract a charge of up to ₹20 after three transactions from different banks' ATMs monthly, and ₹10 after five withdrawals from SBI ATMs. There'll be no such charge if account balance exceeds ₹25,000 in SBI ATMs or ₹1 lakh in others.
