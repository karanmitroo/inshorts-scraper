India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki on Saturday reported its highest-ever domestic monthly sales at 1,37,321 units in September, up by 29.4% from the year-ago period. The record beats Maruti's previous best of 1,25,778 units registered in July. This comes amid robust demand for Vitara Brezza, Baleno, and Ciaz, besides recovery in volumes of the small car segment.
