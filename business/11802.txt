A Hyderabad court on Wednesday convicted Vijay Mallya in a cheque-bouncing case filed against him by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited. The court had earlier issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya and another senior official of Kingfisher Airlines in the case. The court, however, did not pronounce the quantum of punishment as Mallya was not present, his lawyer said.
