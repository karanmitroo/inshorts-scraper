India's largest utility vehicle manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra on Friday said Executive Director Pawan Goenka has been elevated to the position of Managing Director, and Anand Mahindra was redesignated as the Executive Chairman. This is in line with the practice followed by Mahindra Group companies, where the position of Managing Director is kept distinct from the Chairman, the automaker said.
