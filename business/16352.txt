The "missing documents" related to the Vadra-DLF land deal, could not be traced by the Haryana government. The govt had claimed earlier that the files were sent to a Mohali resident, in response to an RTI petition. However, they could not be retrieved later from the said individual. Surprisingly, the govt had no duplicate copies of the crucial documents.
