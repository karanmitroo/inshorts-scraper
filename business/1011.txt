Reliance Communications Chairman Anil Ambani said he went through "torture, trauma, mental agony" when subjected to CBI questionings in the 2G scam case. "I would get calls from people saying...you are going to go to jail," he said. Claiming that these are life-changing experiences, he said, "They are not for the ordinary. You have to be tempered like steel."
