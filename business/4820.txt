After IT giants Cognizant, Infosys, and Wipro, Tech Mahindra may also lay off about 1,500 employees for poor performance, according to reports. "We have a process of weeding out bottom performers every year and this year is no different," the company reportedly said. Notably, Tech Mahindra is India's fifth largest IT services provider and has 1,17,095 employees across 90 countries.
