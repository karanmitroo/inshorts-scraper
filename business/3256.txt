Tata Motors and Volkswagen Group's Skoda Auto have called off their proposed agreement to co-develop cars after five months. "We have concluded that the strategic benefits for both parties are below the threshold levels," Tata Motors CEO Guenter Butschek said. The companies, however, said they could revive cooperation efforts in the future if the conditions arise.
