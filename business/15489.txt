Chairman and Director of United Spirits Vijay Mallya has been asked to step down from the post by USL's new owners Diageo, following allegations of fund diversion to Kingfisher and other UB group entities. Mallya has refused to step down and called the allegations unjustified and false. Diageo is now likely to recommend his removal to shareholders of the company.
