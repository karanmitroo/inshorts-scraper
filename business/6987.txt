The Economic Survey is a flagship document presented by the Finance Ministry in the Parliament every year, just before the Union Budget. The survey reviews the developments in the economy over the previous 12 months and summarises the performance on major programmes. It also highlights the government's policy initiatives and prospects of the economy in the short to medium term.
