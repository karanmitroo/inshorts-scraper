India, the world's third-largest oil importer, will receive its first ever shipment of US crude oil on Monday. The government has encouraged state-controlled refiners to buy US and Canadian crude from US Gulf coast as it looks at cheaper alternatives. "We expect to buy one shipload of US crude every month through tenders," said Indian Oil Corporation Chairman Sanjiv Singh.
