Former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli, who is facing a fraud trial, was casted as a 'serial liar' by a prosecutor, while his own lawyer called him a 'well-meaning but misunderstood genius'. "If Martin Shkreli wanted to defraud these people, why didn't he defraud them?" Shkreli's lawyer argued. Notably, Shkreli once raised the price of an HIV drug by 5,400%.
