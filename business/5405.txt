Infosys Co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan has said the Indian IT industry will see steady growth and that the US H-1B visa will be the only major issue this year. "That's one challenge I see. I don't see anything particularly different this year," he stated. If global GDP grows around 2-3%, Indian IT industry will grow by around 10%, he added.
