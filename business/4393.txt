Delhi Metro Rail has moved Supreme Court against Delhi High Court's order directing it to pay â‚¹60 crore as three months' interest to a lender of Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary Delhi Airport Metro Express. The corporation challenged an earlier order in favour of Reliance. The case relates to Reliance terminating a metro project in 2012 because DMRC failed to fix defects.
