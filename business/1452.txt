Nearly 10.5% of medicines in low and middle-income countries including India are substandard and falsified, a World Health Organisation (WHO) report showed on Tuesday. "Not only is this a waste of money...but substandard or falsified medical products can cause serious illness or even death," WHO said. It added that such products contribute to antimicrobial resistance and drug-resistant infections.
