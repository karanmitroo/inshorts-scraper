Online retail giant eBay will slash 2,400 jobs – seven per cent of its workforce – in the current quarter across its three divisions: Marketplaces, Enterprise and PayPal. US-based eBay unveiled the move Wednesday while it announced that its profit in the fourth quarter rose to $936 million. The reorganization will return eBay to its roots with the “Marketplaces” division.
