The National Pension Scheme's (NPS) retail segment has grown by over 100% within the last year. This comes after a budgetary provision introduced tax benefits on 40% of the withdrawal amount at the maturity of any NPS, PFRDA Chairman Hemant Contractor said. Total assets under NPS have reached ₹1.38 lakh crore, of which ₹3,000 crore are retail assets, he added.
