Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said one crore jobs will be created in the shipping and ports sector alone, under the governmentâ€™s Sagarmala project in the next 4-5 years. The project is aimed at promoting port-led development in India by harnessing its 7,500-km long coastline, 14,500-km of potentially navigable waterways and strategic locations on key international maritime trade routes.
