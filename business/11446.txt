The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has informed the telecom operators that it will only indicate the pending dues of the seller in a spectrum deal and the buyer needs to perform "due diligence" in the transaction. This comes after the telecom firms asked the DoT if it will issue a 'no-dues certificate' for an operator in a spectrum trading deal.
