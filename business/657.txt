Volkswagen has apologised after reports revealed that it funded a 2014 study that exposed monkeys to toxic diesel fumes. The New York Times had reported that the study was aimed at countering a 2012 World Health Organization decision to classify diesel exhaust as a carcinogen. The study, which was financed equally by Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler, was abandoned last year.
