The Enforcement Directorate has attached assets worth ₹306.70 crore belonging to Jignesh Shah-promoted Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL). FTIL has been in crisis following the ₹5,600 crore payment default at its subsidiary National Spot Exchange in 2013. Notably, Shah was arrested this week in connection with alleged irregularities while granting a licence to the MCX Stock Exchange (MCX-SX).
