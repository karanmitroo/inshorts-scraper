French President Francois Hollande on Monday declared "a state of economic and social emergency", as he unveiled a $2.2 billion plan to revive hiring in France and redefine the country's business model. However, no new emergency powers over the economy will be introduced. Hollande also talked about training jobless workers and giving aid to companies who hire young workers.
