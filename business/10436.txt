The world's largest pension fund, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund has reported a loss of 5.3 trillion yen ($51.3 billion) from its investments in 2015-16, its worst annual performance since the 2008 global financial crisis. The loss was attributed to sharp falls in Japan's stock market amid broader global market turmoil sparked by volatility in Chinese financial markets.
