Telecom regulator TRAI has termed the cellular operator COAI's allegations accusing TRAI of favouring one operator as "baseless". The regulator said that COAI had "got into the habit of making allegations". COAI has alleged that TRAI's orders appeared to be "strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators".
