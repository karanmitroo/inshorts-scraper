Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said as far as taxation is concerned, it pays to be honest. He said the tax authorities will go after evaders whose invoices do not match tax payment post GST. He said the government over the last 2-3 years has made tax evasion difficult that has come as a "rude shock" to many.
