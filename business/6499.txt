A 43-year-old Indian-origin woman in England has sold her home, worth £250,000 (₹2 crore), for £2 (₹170). Rekha Patel was in a long-standing feud with her neighbour, and a court order said her property must be sold to recover the legal fees. She sold it to two companies, signing a 10-year tenancy agreement to live there for £50 a month.
