US regulators approved a new lung cancer pill developed by AstraZeneca called Tagrisso. The pill is to be used for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. The medicine works by targeting a genetic mutation that helps tumours evade current lung cancer pills. Lung cancer accounts for a third of cancer deaths worldwide.
