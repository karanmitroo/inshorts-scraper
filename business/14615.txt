US bike maker Harley-Davidson is calling back in India 3,698 units of its Street XG750 model manufactured this year to fix a faulty seal in the fuel pump inlets. The company said that it is "committed to correcting this issue” in the “interest of customer safety”. It also reportedly wants customers to bring in their bikes for inspection.
