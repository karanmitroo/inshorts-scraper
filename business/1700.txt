In a report to the Civil Aviation Ministry, IndiGo Airlines has said that its employee who shot the video and reported the manhandling case is the main culprit in the incident. This comes after a video of IndiGo staff fighting with a 53-year-old passenger on the tarmac went viral, prompting outrage. The airline has issued an apology to the passenger.
