The world's oldest surviving bank, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena's shares have dropped by nearly 30% to an all-time low. This happened after European Central Bank on Monday warned it to shed €10 billion in bad loans. The drop also dragged down other Italian banks, which are saddled with €360 billion of bad debt, one-third of the Eurozone's total.
