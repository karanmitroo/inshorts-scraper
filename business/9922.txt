The Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that currently, India requires "steady" and "irreversible" reforms instead of a “big bang”. He added that during the recent period of 'global market turmoil', RBI has been cautious but it has not stood still. As uncertainties in global conditions lessen, the pace of reform can pick up, he added.
