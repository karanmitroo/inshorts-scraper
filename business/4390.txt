Announcements in Air India flights will soon be short, crisp, and without errors to ensure passengers are not disturbed by them. After feedback from fliers, the airline has finalised new announcements that will not be repetitive and will be pre-recorded to ensure zero error. In a two-hour flight, Air India usually made 10-12 announcements, which is now reduced to eight.
