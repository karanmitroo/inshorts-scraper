Credit rating agency Moody's has said that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries' credit rating won't be affected by the acquisition of Reliance Communications' wireless infrastructure assets for under ₹25,000 crore. Moody's said, "RIL had cash and cash equivalents of ₹77,000 crore, which can be used to fund the acquisition." Moody's has given a Baa2 rating with a stable outlook to RIL.
