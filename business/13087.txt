Brent crude prices fell below the $30-mark to $29.96 per barrel for the first time since 2004 on Thursday, deepening a recent fall in prices. Thursday's price slump extended losses of over 17% since the start of the year amid speculation that trade sanctions on Iran might be lifted by Monday, adding to the excessive supply in the global markets.
