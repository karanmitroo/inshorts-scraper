Saudi Arabia has raised $17.5 billion in the biggest-ever bond sale by an emerging-market nation as it seeks to shore up finances affected by the slide in oil prices. Investors had submitted bids worth around $67 billion, reports stated. This sale eclipsed Argentinaâ€™s $16.5 billion offering in April, which was previously the largest by a developing nation.
