Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said that telcos have written off investments up to $50 billion due to Jio's "long, free promotional period". He said that in his opinion, Jio would not have been allowed to do the same in Europe or the US. Mittal added the price war in the sector will take two more quarters to stabilise.
