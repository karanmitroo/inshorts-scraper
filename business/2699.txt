Two US men, Maziar Rezakhani and Sam Sadeghi, were held for allegedly buying illegal tips from an ex-Amazon employee, Brett Kennedy, that resulted in $116,000 (₹74 lakh) of profits. They wanted to impress investors to start a hedge fund. Kennedy and Sadeghi agreed to pay over $34,000 (over ₹21 lakh) to settle the case without admitting or denying the claims.
