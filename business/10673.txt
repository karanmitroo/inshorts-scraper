There has been a five-time rise in the limit to purchase goods from duty-free​ shops at international airports across India to ₹25,000 as against ₹5,000 previously. The move reportedly comes amid travellers' complaints regarding the earlier limit being 'less'. Further, customs officials have been asked to display information relating to Indian currency's use at shops, an official said.
