The Supreme court on Monday rejected a plea for the transfer of a case regarding a challenge to interconnection usage charges by telecommunications provider Idea Cellular, from Gujarat to Delhi high court. Telecom regulator Trai, which had sought the plea, asked for the shift as similar pleas by Vodafone and Airtel were being heard in the Delhi High court.
