Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings has cut Australia’s credit rating outlook to negative from stable. This comes after Saturday's federal elections failed to deliver​ either the ruling Liberal-National coalition or the opposition Labor Party a strong mandate. Further, S&P said there is a “one-in-three chance" that Australia's AAA credit rating can be downgraded within the next two years.
