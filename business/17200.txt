The government plans to impose an additional penalty of $578 million on Reliance Industries for producing less-than-targeted natural gas in 2013-14. With this, the total penalty (in the form of disallowed costs) will increase to $2.375 billion. The government had previously issued a notice to RIL disallowing a total of $1.797 billion in costs for falling short of production.
