Air India's operational loss in the June quarter narrowed to ₹246.14 crore from ₹315.37 crore a year earlier. The airline had set a target of ₹87.28 crore operating profit in the first quarter. The Centre attributed the operating loss to a drop in “revenue yields by around 6% over the budgeted target resulting in a decline in passenger revenue”.
