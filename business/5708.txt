A supplier of retail giant Walmart has recalled frozen pizzas available in some US states due to concerns about possible listeria contamination. The supplier recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centres. Further, Walmart said it was unaware of the illnesses linked to the pizzas.
