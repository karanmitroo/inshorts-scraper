Reliance Jio on Sunday alleged that the Cellular Operators Association of India's (COAI) rules including voting norms are “overwhelmingly biased and lopsided” in favour of incumbents Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea. The Mukesh Ambani-led operator further sought an overhaul of COAI norms as the current voting system does not accommodate "reasonableness, fairness, accountability and transparency”.
