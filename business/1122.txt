South Korean prosecutors have demanded a 12-year jail term for Samsung heir Jay Y Lee for his conviction on bribery charges. A lower court had sentenced him to five years in August for allegedly bribing Park Geun-hye, who was dismissed as South Korea's President in March. However, Lee is also appealing the original sentence and has denied any legal wrongdoing.
