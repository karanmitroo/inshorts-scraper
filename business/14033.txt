Ford Motors posted a net income of $1.9 billion in the quarter that ended September against $1.1 billion in the corresponding period the previous year. Quarterly revenue increased by $3.2 billion to $38.1 billion. Moreover, 66% of the quarterly revenue was derived from sales in North America. However, the numbers missed the projections by Wall Street due to higher taxes.
