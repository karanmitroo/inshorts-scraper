The shape of Nestlé’s four-fingered KitKat chocolate biscuit bar is no longer protected after a European court called for the trademark awarded to the food major to be invalid. This means that the KitKat shape can now be used freely by other European manufacturers. Chocolate maker Cadbury originally took the action in 2007 to demand Nestlé’s trademark be declared invalid.
