New Zealanders have donated $2 million (â‚¹13 crore) in just over 24 hours to save an 80-year-old chocolate factory in the city of Dunedin. This comes after Mondelez International announced its plans to close the Cadbury factory next year. As part of the crowdfunding campaign, donors who gave $100 will receive 20% off the factory's chocolate for their lifetime.
