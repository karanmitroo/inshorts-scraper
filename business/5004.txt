Mobile subscriber additions by Indian telcos jumped more than three times between October and March, the highest in a six-month period since 2011-12, according to brokerage firm CLSA. This was due to Reliance Jio's free services, which attracted more customers and forced other companies to engage in a tariff war. Notably, Reliance Jio reported net subscriber additions of 9.3 crore.
