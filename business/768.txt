Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan has said that India's startups will flourish if the regulatory environment becomes more friendly. "You can't expect a startup started by an entrepreneur who is 25-30 years (old) to comply with some 30 to 40 laws," he added. He further said that one can't expect a startup to adhere to all matured company regulations.
