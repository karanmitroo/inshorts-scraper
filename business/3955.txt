Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker has said American Airlines CEO Doug Parker is “frightened” by its plans to take a stake in the firm. Al Baker said the airline intends to buy shares of American if they’re attractively priced regardless of Parker’s opposition. “We won't impose ourselves on anybody,” he said, adding, "We want to be a strategic shareholder."
