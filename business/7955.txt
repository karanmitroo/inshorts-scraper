Tata Sons' ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry, who was removed as the Chairman of Tata Global Beverages on Tuesday, has called his removal "inaccurate and illegal.” Mistry’s removal came within hours of his office issuing a rebuttal denying all the allegations made by Tata Sons. Mistry was also removed as the Chairman of Tata Consultancy Services last week.
