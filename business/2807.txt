Infosys on Friday said it is engaging with shareholders on the future course of action to ensure that high governance standards are maintained. On August 18, CEO Vishal Sikka had quit from his position citing "personal attacks" which Infosys had blamed on Co-founder Narayana Murthy. Murthy also questioned alleged irregularities with the Panaya acquisition, and severance pay to former executives.
