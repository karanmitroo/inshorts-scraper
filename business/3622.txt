ONGC, after buying out the government's stake in HPCL, will reportedly not make an open offer to HPCL's minority shareholders, as governmentâ€™s holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and management complexion remains the same. An official said the transaction shouldn't trigger takeover code unless valuations are absurd. The takeover will make ONGC the third-largest refiner in India.
