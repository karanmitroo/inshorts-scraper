The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Telecom Commission’s proposal to fix a minimum Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) at 3% of operators’ adjusted gross revenue for future spectrum auctions. The new SUC calculations will take a weighted average of the charges for spectrums held by operators. Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will reportedly begin spectrum auctions by September end.
