SpiceJet resumed its flight operations on Wednesday, as oil companies began supplying jet fuel to the cash-strapped airline. After a brief hiatus, the domestic airline is now getting fuel as per the terms of 'cash and carry' agreement put in place about six months back. Earlier on Wednesday morning, SpiceJet had grounded all its aircraft due to payment woes.
