ICICI Bank on Tuesday launched a contactless option in its app 'Pockets' that will allow users to make payments at outlets by tapping their smartphones. Currently, the feature is made available to the bank's employees which will be extended to all ICICI card holders. The service creates 'virtual' cards for the physical cards, that are stored on the banks' servers.
