According to media reports, the cabinet is likely to consider the restructuring of Rs 4.3 lakh crore worth of loans of state power companies to bring down their debts. State-run discoms are currently facing an annual loss of Rs 60,000 crore, and this debt restructuring would help the companies get cheaper loans at around 9%, against the present 14%.
