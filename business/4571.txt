The Indian Railways has earned over â‚¹3,000 crore through reservation cancellations in the last three years. Further, the biggest income was made from the non-cancellation of window waiting tickets as passengers only get a three-and-a-half-hour window to cancel the tickets and the confirmation for the same is announced 4 hours before the trains' departure.
