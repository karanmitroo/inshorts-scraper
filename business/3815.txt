As per government data, India's Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation for June fell to 0.9%, as against 2.17% in May, driven mainly by falling food prices. This is the lowest level of WPI inflation since July 2016. This comes after India's retail inflation in June cooled to a record low of 1.54% due to GST-induced discounts.
