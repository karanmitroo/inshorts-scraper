Volkswagen on Thursday recalled 389 Polo hatchbacks in India for preventive repair over an issue with the handbrake mechanism, which might "lose effectiveness" under certain conditions, the German carmaker claimed in a statement. The company's headquarter in Germany was also raided on the day over the emissions scandal that has affected around 11 million diesel vehicles globally.
