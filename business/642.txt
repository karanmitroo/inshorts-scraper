Ex-Finance Minister P Chidambaram has claimed the BJP government's plan to create 75 lakh jobs by March is "outrageous" and impossible. He said if India can create 75 lakh jobs in the formal sector, it must have created another 75 lakh jobs in the informal sector. "China's GDP is five times India's and it creates 150 lakh jobs," he added.
