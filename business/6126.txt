HDFC Bank CEO Aditya Puri on Friday backed setting up a national bad bank, saying anything that can help resolve the bad loans problem is welcome. "The...regulators are coming up with various discussions as to how (to) solve the issue relating to NPAs and that is necessary," he said. Other ideas like the Bankruptcy Code should also help, Puri added.
