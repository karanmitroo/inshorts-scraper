Telecom major Verizon Communications on Tuesday said it would buy Yahoo's core business for $4.48 billion, lowering its original offer by $350 million (over â‚¹2,300 crore). The payment has been reduced over two data breaches revealed by Yahoo after the deal was finalised. The deal, which was first announced in July, had been delayed after Yahoo disclosed the data breaches.
