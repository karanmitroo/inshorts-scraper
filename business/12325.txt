ICICI Bank, as part of a new initiative, will allow its 21,000 women employees to work from home for up to one year along and take their children and care-giver on business trips. The initiative was rolled out after a survey revealed that two-thirds of women employees quit their jobs in ICICI due to long commutes and child-care responsibilities.
