The government named new chief executives for seven state-run banks on Friday, at a time when regulators are trying to clean up record bad loans in the sector. The banks which will have new bosses include Punjab National Bank and Indian Overseas Bank. Usha Ananthasubramanian, currently PNB's CEO, will move to become the CEO of smaller Allahabad Bank.
