In a domestic abuse case filed by his wife of 10 years, Cuberon CEO Abhishek Gattani, an Indian-American, was allowed a plea agreement which lets him avoid deportation and likely face 30 days of imprisonment. Notably, Gattani's estranged wife Neha Rastogi, a former Apple engineer, had submitted recordings of him beating and verbally abusing her to the court.
