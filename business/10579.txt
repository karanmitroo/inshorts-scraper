The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India on Wednesday issued draft guidelines for instant noodle standards amid attempts to bring clarity in regulating these products. This follows FSSAI's ban on Nestle's 'Maggi' last year over allegations of high lead content and MSG level above permissible limit. FSSAI also issued draft guidelines for fortified atta and fortified rice, among others.
