Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of the company behind world's third-largest cryptocurrency Ripple, has said that he expects most cryptocurrencies to eventually go to zero. He said that most coins are being traded solely on a speculative basis and can't be used as transactional currency. "Long-term value will be dictated by the utility of that asset," Garlinghouse added.
