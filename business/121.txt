US bank JPMorgan Chase has termed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as "risk" to its business for the first time. "Both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by...cryptocurrencies," the bank said. Earlier, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had said that he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud in the past.
