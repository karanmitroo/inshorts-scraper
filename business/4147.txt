US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump has been ordered to give a deposition in a lawsuit claiming her brand plagiarised a shoe design. Trump's lawyers had earlier filed a motion to prevent her from testifying. An Italian shoe company sued Ivanka's brand, alleging that it created an identical copy of one of their shoe models called the "Wild Thing".
