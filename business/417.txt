A UK court has ordered absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines to pay $90 million in claims to Singapore-based aircraft leasing company BOC Aviation. The legal claim relates to a leasing agreement between Kingfisher and BOC Aviation involving four aircraft. Kingfisher reportedly failed to pay BOC Aviation the amounts due in advance after three planes were delivered.
