The State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday said it has raised $300 million (about ₹2,000 crore) through AT-1 Basel III-compliant​ bonds to fund its business growth. These bonds come with loss absorbency features, meaning that in the case of stress, lenders can write off such investments or convert them into common equity if approved by the RBI.
