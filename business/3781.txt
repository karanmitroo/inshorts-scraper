Virgin Group founder Richard Branson on Friday said he had a feeling United States President Donald Trump was regretting the "bizarre mistake" of pulling America out of the Paris climate deal. Terming Trump's withdrawal "very, very strange," Branson pointed to his head and said, "Who knows what goes in there". He added, "Hopefully there is a positive change of mind."
