A surprise drop in US crude oil inventories saw oil prices recover from a one-month low of $55.92 to above $57 a barrel Wednesday. Prices fell by $2.14 on Tuesday on the back of a strengthened dollar and global oversupply, but rose again after reports of a 404,000-barrel fall in US stocks instead of an expected 4.4 million barrel build.
