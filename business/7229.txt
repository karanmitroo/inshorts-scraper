SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya has said the government should find ways to dis-incentivise cash transactions, such as imposing a charge or levy above a specified limit, after normalcy is restored following demonetisation. “Cash imposes a huge burden. We don’t understand it as it is not immediately visible. It is a huge burden on society," she added.
