IT industry body Nasscom has reported that the recruitments in the industry may fall 20% as major players are shifting their focus to automation. However, the drop in recruitment will not affect the projected 10-11% revenue growth this fiscal, Nasscom's Chairman CP Gurnani said. Nasscom had earlier predicted that the software industry will hire around 2.75 lakh people in 2016-17.
