NTT DoCoMo has received $1.27 billion from Tata Sons after arbitration, and its entire 26.5% stake in Tata Teleservices has been transferred to Tata Sons. This ends the over 3-year dispute that started when DoCoMo decided to sell its stake in the loss-making Tata Teleservices. Tata Sons had refused to buyback DoCoMo's stake at the pre-determined prices forcing a settlement.
