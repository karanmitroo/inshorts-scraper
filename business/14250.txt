India’s animation industry generated revenues of ₹4,490 crore in 2014, a 13% growth over the previous year, according to a FICCI-KPMG report. The report on India’s media and entertainment sector further said that the country’s animation industry is expected to double in size to ₹9,550 crore within five years, largely due to an increase in assignments from Hollywood studios.
