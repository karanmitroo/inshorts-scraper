Bank of America has opened three completely automated branches in the US which do not employ any human. At the automated branches, customers can use ATMs and have video conferences with the employees at other branches. About a fourth of the size of a typical branch, these branches sell mortgages, credit cards and auto loans rather than cashing cheques.
