Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that banks must restore their credibility and work for the society as it is the taxpayers' money which is being infused into the banking system. "The taxpayers... are just not the corporates, it includes middle class, lower middle class, and all are making a sacrifice to keep you (banks) in good health," he added.
