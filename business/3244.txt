Wins Finance Holdings, a Chinese loan guarantor that did not know why its stock surged 4,555%, is set to be delisted from Nasdaq Stock Market. Nasdaq cited violations of exchange rules and said Wins doesn't meet regulations requiring it to have at least 300 shareholders who own 100 shares. However, Wins plans to request a hearing to appeal the decision.
