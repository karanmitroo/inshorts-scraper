Japanese automaker Toyota on Thursday posted a 14.5% year-on-year decline in net income at ¥552.5 billion ($5.4 billion) for the quarter ended June. Net revenue also fell 5.7% to ¥6.59 trillion ($65.3 billion). Toyota attributed the decline to an appreciating yen as it cut its full-year operating profit forecast, expecting it to fall 44% to its lowest since 2013.
