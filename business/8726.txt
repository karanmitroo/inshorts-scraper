Investment banking major Goldman Sachs on Tuesday reported a 47% year-on-year rise in net earnings for the quarter ended September to $2.10 billion. This was the bank's second straight rise in quarterly profit after four quarters of decline. Further, total net revenue rose 19% to $8.17 billion. The rise was attributed to an increase in trading activity that exceeded expectations.
