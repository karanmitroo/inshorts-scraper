Iran on Thursday broke off all its commercial ties with Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani chaired a cabinet meeting where it was decided that all imports from Saudi Arabia would be banned. Earlier, Saudi Arabia had halted trade links and air traffic with Iran. Tensions between the nations escalated after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
