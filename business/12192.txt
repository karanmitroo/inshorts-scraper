Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh on Saturday refuted industry body Assocham's estimate of damage to wheat output due to the recent rains and hailstorm as "factually incorrect". The estimate of 13 million tonnes was released to compel the government to reduce the import duty on wheat and doing so would lead to a fall in its prices, he added.
