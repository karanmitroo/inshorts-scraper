European aircraft maker Airbus aims to overtake rival Boeing in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020, CEO Fabrice Br√©gier said. Further, Airbus aims to deliver 50 aircraft this year, although deliveries by September-end stood at 26, he added. Notably, while Airbus has been leading in terms of new orders, Boeing has been ahead since 2012 in terms of deliveries.
