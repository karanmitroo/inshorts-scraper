The RBI is exploring the introduction of interest-free banking, also known as Islamic Banking, for sections of the society excluded due to religious reasons, according to an RBI report. Islamic or Sharia banking is based on the principles of not charging interest, which is prohibited under Islam. Some political parties, including Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have opposed it in the past.
