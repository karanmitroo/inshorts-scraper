The Swiss People's Party, a political party in Switzerland, has opposed automatic exchange of banking information with India and 10 other nations. Some private banks in Switzerland had earlier opposed the pact, but government went ahead with the framework after putting in place necessary confidentiality clauses. Notably, SVP supported a campaign to protect bank secrecy in Switzerland last year.
