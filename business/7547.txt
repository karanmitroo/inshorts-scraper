Low-cost airline SpiceJet plans to pay up to ₹15 crore annual remuneration, including a fixed monthly salary of ₹50 lakh, to its Managing Director Ajay Singh. Singh, who returned in January 2015, had decided not to take salary till the airline turned profitable. Notably, staying profitable for the seventh straight quarter, SpiceJet reported its highest-ever quarterly profit in July-September.
