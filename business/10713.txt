The government has initiated the process to sell its stake in 51 companies held through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) to boost revenue by about ₹50,000 crore. The asset sales would help the government meet its disinvestment revenue target of ₹56,500 crore for 2016-17 and reduce the fiscal deficit projected at ₹5.33 lakh crore.
