India's largest lender SBI has posted multi-fold year-on-year jump in consolidated net profit at ₹1,840 crore for the September quarter, mainly because of the sale of its stake in SBI Life Insurance. The net interest income also increased 27.3% to ₹18,586 crore during the quarter. However, the bank's standalone profit declined by 37.9% on account of rise in bad loans.
