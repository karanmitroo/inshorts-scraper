Jewellery body AIBJSF on Friday decided to continue their strike, which commenced on March 2, for an indefinite period, opposing the proposed 1% excise duty on non-silver jewellery. The association also announced a series of protests including "handing over keys of shops to the Finance Minister". This comes after three major jewellery bodies called off their strike on March 19.
