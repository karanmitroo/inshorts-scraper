Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while presenting the Union Budget on Wednesday said that the government is considering a law to confiscate assets of economic offenders who flee the country. He added that the Indian society is largely tax non-compliant, putting a burden on those who pay taxes. Only 1.7 lakh people declared income above â‚¹50 lakh per annum, Jaitley said.
