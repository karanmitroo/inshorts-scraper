The Supreme Court on Friday lifted the ban on the registration of diesel vehicles having engine over 2,000 cc in Delhi NCR. The SC further ruled that all manufacturers, dealers or buyers have to deposit 1% 'environment compensation' cost on purchase of diesel cars. This comes after German carmaker Mercedes on Monday moved the SC seeking to lift the ban.
