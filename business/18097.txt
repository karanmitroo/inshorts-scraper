Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting, "Three Studies of Lucian Freud," which auctioned for $142.4 million at Christie's (New York) on Tuesday, became the most expensive art-work sold at an auction ever, surpassing Edvard Munch's "The Scream" auctioned for $119.9 million last year. The previous record for a Bacon work of art was $86.3 million set in 2008.
