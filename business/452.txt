The Income Tax Department has asked people who deposited "large amounts of cash" post demonetisation to file tax returns by March 31. The department said it was the last chance for filing "belated or revised returns" for assessment years 2016-17 and 2017-18. It has also cautioned eligible trusts, political parties, and associations to file their returns and "come clean".
