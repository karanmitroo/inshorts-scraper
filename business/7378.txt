As per reports, a Kundan Care Products Ltd gold outlet in Delhi sold items worth ₹75 crore in cash within 4 hours on November 8 after the announcement of demonetisation. While the sales are being considered 'suspicious' for no PAN numbers being recorded, the gold outlet gave "sales being below ₹2 lakh per customer" as the reason for the same.
