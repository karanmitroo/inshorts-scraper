Food major Mondelez will pay $13 million (around ₹89 crore) penalty to the US government for violating anti-corruption law by its subsidiary, erstwhile Cadbury India. The matter relates to Cadbury India allegedly paying over ₹61 lakh to an agent to obtain "outside assistance" in securing licenses and approvals, which allowed Cadbury to claim a tax exemption worth over $90 million.
