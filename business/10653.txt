The Cabinet on Wednesday relaxed the excise duty rules on gold jewellery. The new rules exempt the jewellery manufacturers having an annual turnover up to ₹15 crore from the excise duty, as against the previous ₹12 crore limit. This comes after the jewellers protested over the imposition of 1% excise duty on gold jewellery, as proposed in the budget.
