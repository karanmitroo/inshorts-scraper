A Shanghai court has ordered sportswear company Puma to pay $421,340 (â‚¹2.7 crore) for infringing the goat's head logo of a Chinese wool company. The court ruled Puma copied the image created especially for the Year of Goat in 2015 and used it on its products. The only difference between the two companies' logos was the size, the court concluded.
