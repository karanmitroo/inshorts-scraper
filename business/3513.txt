US aviation authorities have been ordered to solve what an appeals judge called "The Case of the Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat". "[A]ircraft seats...have been getting smaller and smaller, while American passengers have been growing in size," the judge said. The court ruled in favour of non-profit group Flyers Rights, which argued that shrinking legroom and seat size created safety hazards.
