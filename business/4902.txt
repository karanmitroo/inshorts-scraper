Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay over $110 million (₹707 crore) to a woman who blamed her ovarian cancer on its talcum products. The woman used J&J’s baby powder and Shower to Shower talc products for 40 years before her diagnosis in 2012. Over 3,000 lawsuits have accused J&J of ignoring studies linking its products to ovarian cancer.
