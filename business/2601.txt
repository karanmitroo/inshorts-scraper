Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said about 30 crore families have got bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, launched three years ago. He further noted the number of zero-balance accounts reduced from 77% to 20%. Notably, about 42% of households were unbanked before the scheme but now nearly 99% of households have at least one bank account.
