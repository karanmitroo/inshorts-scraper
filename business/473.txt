The wealth of billionaire couple Dinesh and Jyoti Nandwana, promoters of fintech firm Vakrangee, declined by over $2 billion in seven trading sessions. The fortune of the Nandwanas, who own 42% of Vakrangee, fell after the company's share price tumbled nearly 60% from its January 25 peak. The plunge came after reports said SEBI is investigating alleged share price manipulation.
