State-owned CIL is likely to enter into a pact with the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, for a third-party audit of mine closure plans (MCPs), environmental audit, and forestry issues. The Centre is preparing special plans for studying each coal mine for its closure, the Coal Ministry said. The CIL has identified 476 mines for closure so far, the Ministry added.
