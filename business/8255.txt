India will reportedly sign a deal to purchase 12 amphibious rescue aircraft worth around $1.5 billion (over â‚¹10,000 crore) from Japanese manufacturer ShinMaywa Industries. This would be one of Japan's first sales of military equipment since PM Shinzo Abe lifted a 50-year ban on arms exports. The deal is expected to be signed during Abe's India visit this week.
