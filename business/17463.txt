Online payment giant PayPal fired its senior executive Rakesh Agrawal after he made a series of insulting, mostly incomprehensible, tweets against co-workers. Ironically, the announcement was made via twitter. Agarwal had joined Paypal around two months ago as its global strategy head. The language and (lack of) grammar in the tweets hinted that he was probably drunk at that time.
