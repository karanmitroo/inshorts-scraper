Coffeehouse company Dunkin' Donuts is considering to drop "donuts" from its name, and as a test, a storefront in US will just be called Dunkin', according to reports. While Dunkin' will still sell donuts, it wants to be known first and foremost for its coffee, reports added. The change comes at the request of the chain's parent company Dunkin' Brands.
