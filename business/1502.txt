SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar has said that any wrongdoing should be punished, be it banks, businessmen or those exerting outside pressure. He said that concerns of political pressure on state-run lenders in making lending decisions are overplayed. He further added that bad debts choking India's banking system are mostly because of assumptions about economic growth that have gone wrong.
