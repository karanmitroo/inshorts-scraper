Petrol pumps will not accept payments through credit or debit cards starting Monday because HDFC and other banks have decided to levy up to 1% charge for transactions, All India Petroleum Dealers Association said. Banks which are willing to not charge such transaction fee can contact us and we will continue to accept cards on their point-of-sale machines, it added.
