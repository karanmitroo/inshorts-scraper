The team found that infusing young blood boosted levels of a gene-regulating enzyme Tet2 in the brain's hippocampus which deals with memory and learning. A reduction of Tet2 levels causes reduced birth of neurones, leading to cognitive decline."

Instead of directly measuring water temperature, they determined the ratio of noble gases in the atmosphere, which are in direct relation to the ocean's temperature. They found present-day global ocean temperature average to be 3.5\u00baC while temperature during the most recent ice age was found to be 0.9\u00baC."

The features create an effect making the refractive index change gradually from air to glass, thereby reducing the reflections. The \"invisible glass\" could increase the efficiency of solar cells and improve electronic displays, said researchers."

The discoveries add evidence to the theory that human-ape lineages split in Europe, the researchers said."

Hence, predicting such an event early would prevent a catastrophic natural disaster, they added."

DNA's ability to store genetic information comes from the fact that its A,C,G,T bases link across the two strands in a specific manner. The information can be replicated as each strand can act as a template for generating a complementary strand."

The $500-million spacecraft launched in 2009 is currently collecting essential data for future lunar missions."

A sunspot cycle is a time after which sun's illumination completes one round of increasing and decreasing brightness."

The new material, called hybrid organic-inorganic\u200b perovskites (HOIPs), are cheaper to manufacture in large scale and is tolerant to defects, unlike silicon cells which require 99.999% purity. Further, HOIP cells reportedly have much lower energy loss rates."

The change in wind direction was caused by drop in atmospheric temperature during eclipse, preventing air to rise from the ground and decreasing the wind speed, which leads to a shift in its direction."

For this, the vibrations or small movements caused by random forces, like a passing gust of wind or oscillations of bridges, would be used. To test, scientists constructed a tree-like device which produced electricity even when there was unnoticeable movement."

        "article": "Researchers from Australia and United States have found that space storms across the equator could threaten power grids in regions near the equator like India, previously considered safe from such events. Even minor storms could disrupt the power infrastructure due to amplification by atmospheric electricity. Space storms have previously knocked out power in Europe and North America. \n\n\n"

        "article": "A recent study on a 90 million-year-old fossil indicated that snakes lost their legs when their ancestors evolved to live and hunt in burrows. Scientists used CT scans and built 3D models to compare the fossil to modern snakes and lizards. The study showed that snakes did not lose their limbs to live in the sea as previously believed."

        "article": "Researchers at a US university have created a new phase of solid carbon which is harder than diamonds. Named Q-carbon, the isotope can glow at low energy levels and is ferromagnetic. Q-carbon can be used in the domains of drug delivery and power electronics. So far, diamond was considered as the hardest naturally occurring material."

The flip could cause climate-change, storms, disrupt satellites and make weather in space highly hazardous over the next few months, scientists have warned. "

The comparisons of hydrogen and antihydrogen atoms constitute one of the best ways to perform highly precise tests of matter/antimatter symmetry, researchers said."

Jupiter's twin is almost exactly the same distance from HIP 11915 as Jupiter itself is from our sun, researchers said. The discovery implies the existence of a solar system similar to ours, researchers claim."
